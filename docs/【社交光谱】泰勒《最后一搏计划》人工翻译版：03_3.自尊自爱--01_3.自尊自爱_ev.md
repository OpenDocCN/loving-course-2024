# 【社交光谱】泰勒《最后一搏计划》人工翻译版：03_3.自尊自爱--01_3.自尊自爱_ev

Explain。I want to be very， very objective。About your success。

 you want to know what I raised my last rejection？A trillion out of 1。🎼So to cut up to you。🎼Yeah。

🎼Everyybody， get your mother fucking roll。🎼I don'm show you， she doesn't wantan to so。Hi。

 I'm Owen my last sexual or attempted sexual exchange was a two out of1ed。

Every single approach that you do is leading you towards a higher state of momentum Basically I want to show you exactly how to implement what we've been focusing on。

🎼Com go with your phone now stepping like a favor。😊，It's called a feedback sandwich， right。

 people who love themselves are loved by others。That's a real one and your reflection。

 without a follow， without a mention， you really piping up on these neighbors。

 you gotta be nice for what to these neighbors I understand。

Hey film from real social dynamics I'm just kicking it in my home in Los Angeles this evening。

 we're about to shoot down there and shoot the video And what I want to talk to you about today is how to boost your mood whenever you're out meeting women。

 And the reason why this is so important is that when you do this。

 all the different techniques that you might use to get a girl to like you will begin to happen automatically I'm ready to get married。

てバだ。Pro probablyably would have just much of a chance of working as a regular marriage。さで。どうり。

All right， so what am'm going to predict？Everybody watching this。Is that your last pickup was。

 you know， a 7。Or maybe a three。Or maybe if you got laid。With a perfectly hot girl。

 you'll give yourself a 10。Actually， I think that that scale。Of one to tennis0 fucking bullshit。

 Do you want to know what I rate my last pickup， a million out of 10。

 And do you want to know what I rate my last rejection， a trillion out of 10。

 You want to know what I rate every single interaction that I ever do。

 a gazillion trillion billion Google out of 10 is very cool let's go to the taxi over here。

 the taxi like this Good， good， honey know Howard guy colonial guy。😊。

catch them up to their friends a little bit， like be like， here， come on your friends。随在一首。嗯嗯。

今ナそれったそれいや回。我要的。🎼R state。泵。So for that we do poles， right， everything leads to the next thing。

 so start your night， get in a better mood， get in a better mood， get in a better mood。

Make awesome and girls， move and girls around， hug， party， enjoy， party， enjoy poll。

 and so the beginning of the night， which is so awkward， hey like that， it was good， it was good。

 that was fun， give yourself credit and at the end you get fucking results。Okay。

 it's about resourcess because you're new。Look what they're doing， right， just starting out。Good in。

 Okay， and it keeps getting better， better， You get hotter and hotter。

 better and better as you progress。 For me， what I want to do is I want to be very， very objective。

About your success。And you just fucking dominating in every way possible。😡，Now。

 the problem with that and this is what most guys don't get。Is that what do women like？

To women like rational metrics， is it very important that inspiring pickup artists is very objective about their progress。

 and not last interactionsurction did not result in a sexual exchange of value where you had the sex。

 So therefore we're going to rate it as the two out of1。

And then as you walk from that to out of Teden to the next girl。Hi， I'm Owen。

 my last sexual or attempted sexual exchange was a two out of Ted。

I'm going to execute a technique on you。Is that gonna' work。 What the fuck is this。

 This is what most guys are doing。 This is what I see。 I'm being very dramatic here。 I'm sure。

 I'm dramatic to hammer home points。 Most people are kind of in days Lets get dramatic。😡。

Most guys that I see are go out， they go out to one girl， they look like this when they come out。

Like they got their fucking head kicked in， like their puppy got kicked。After every interaction。

What's going on there。 There's no self love there。 There's no self compassion。

 There's no self respect。 There's no basic level dignity。

 There's no enjoyment of yourself and your own company。

 There's no enjoyment of whatever company that you had with her。 albeit， very brief。

It's just a disrespect for yourself， a disrespect for life in general and a shitty fucking attitude。

 So I gauge this。😡，When I see you coming out of an interaction with the woman。

 And I look at your body language。 I look at your facial expression。

 and I'll mess with you a little bit。 I' say， hey， how was that， How'd that go。乌诉。Use's not bad。

News okay。Basing your entire self esteem on that one interaction。 And you're saying， no， I didn't。

 I'm just surrealist。 Well， wait， whats surrealist。

 What gets results of women guys in a good mood that are having fun who love themselves and aren't needy and desperate。

 aren't engagingug their。Self concept based on that interaction with some random chick。不去。こちね。你好。你没有。

What are you up to right now？Priren find that。This way，Pleasure to meet you， by the way。

 are you from LA？は。前い。绝对来。Do you have a lot of friends here， I do。

Weho are your friends here I am trying Yeah that's cute okay。

 I'm going to let you back to your friends right now excited' back to my first pleasure to meet you。

I see you too Yeah， we do some party sometimes you want me to invite you you looks like。

 I'll grab your number。What is it6，04？Are you from DC originally， BC？Go点。Got it okay。

 I'll text you very beautiful girl thank you the。My ideal what I want out to interaction with the woman is that I'm smiling。

 laughing and having so much fun。 And I know that when I do that。

 that the next interaction is gonna go better and better every single time。 So see。

 I'm about results。 But the metric that I'm after is not， did I get a3 of the last approach。 know。

 For that approach， my metric that I'm looking for is massive success。

 And that being the case I know that a bit of irrationality when coming out of an interaction is actually the key。

 But going deeper than that。 What I would ask you is how irrational is it to say 100 out of 10。

 And that's what we gotta think about next。 is leading towards that end of the。😊。

I like your facial expressions。 Thank you。 It was very like I make them very're hugging How do you guys know each other we each other Sorry Sorry for the creepy arm of holding middle this are you serious you've been friends that long Yeah you've never like taking each other's boyfriend that would be who's she she and's No。

 that's my phone Oh。W Who is the dominant girl between the two of you What does that mean Like usually there's a leader like the one one very different one that says teachers dont me look like teachers don't bed Tea Are you guys getting this Like are like you're a teacher I'm like they're like you guys make the exact same facial expressions as each other actually。

 It's the teacher love even more valuable than saying to yourself that it's rational to rate an interaction that went nowhere is positive。

 What about the fact that it could be rational Let me ask you a question。

 how many guys do you think are going up to women。And trying to engage them。Very few。 Okay。

 most of the guys that you see there are friends with the girls。 But let's go even deeper than that。

 How many guys are doing it sober。 I rarely see it being done sober。

What I do see is a lot of drunk guys approaching and what I do see is a lot of guys sitting around with their drinks press up against their chest。

 So any time that you went in， why don't you give yourself some fucking compassion。

 Love yourself I'm teaching you a method where like the game can be easy and it's like you can do it regularly。

 It felt like burning yourself out and stuff。 So just think a little bit about that tonight to the way I'm showing it to you It's like I actually have more energy than the night not less。

 persona fatigue， decision making fatigue， selflfjugment， fatigue burns you out。So basically。

 the first one is decision making fatigue， should I， shouldn't I， should I。

 shouldn't I Burns burns you down， just approach fucking everybody takes two seconds。

 you get a momentum。 You feel actually better。 paradoxically by trying to save energy。

 that energy scarcity frame burns you out。By being in a great mood and just viewing energy as abundant。

 you actually get into a better， more childlike state。

 So approach everybody just even for two seconds。 Hey， like that， It's great。

 And then you feel good about yourself。 Likewise， persona fatigue。

 Then you're going in there trying to play this fucking character。 Well you're exhausted。

 Why you want to do that。 Just be yourself。😡，And then from there， it's self judgment and fatigue。

 it goes bad and you start beating yourself up。Fuck that。

 So think of it like you want to eliminate those fatigues。

 That's why we save after every single approach， it's 100 out of 10。😡，That way， you just go in。

You walk up to any role， it's 110， so you're encouraged not to have decision making fatigue。

You just be yourself and talk？Now you're not getting。Persona fatigue because 110。And then。

 when you leave。You're not getting self judgment fatigue because it's 110。

 you guys see how that those three fatigues get cured by the whole like judge yourself always as positive。

It's an important piece， okay， that's why you're seeing me as I'm going about my night。

 it's always positive， fun， easy chill epic。You know， so that's the key。 personally。

 the way that I think about success with women is that it's momentum based。

 So every single approach that you do is leading you towards a higher state of momentum。

 So the way that I want to think about success with women is that I go and I talk。

I'm going to try hard。I don't go out of my natural behavior。 I just go， what's up， Who。

 how's it going like that， little more momentum。What's up， How's it going， Little more momentum， Hey。

 what's up， What's up， Little more momentum。 Hey， what's up， What's up， Little more momentum， Hey。

 what's up， What's up， little more momentum， Hey， little more momentum。 little more momentum。

 laughing with my friends， little more momentum， having fun in between interactions。

 little more momentum。 And I'm putting myself into a trance。😊。

The transit I'm going into is one of self love， happiness， enjoyment， appreciation for the moment。

 Every moment's amazing。 I miss you。I know you had to go， right your friends。Har coming me。他。

And as you do this again and again， you start seeing the response from women。 You're amazing。

 You're awesome。 You're the one guy that gets it to just have some fucking fun。 You're the prince。

 You're the champ。 You're the king。 That comes from just having fun and giving that girl no power over you。

 Any time that you're giving yourself a metric of two out of Ted or an approach or it was not bad。

 Where's the power。😡，Who has the power？ The girl has the power？

 Does the girl want to have sex with the guy who she has power over。

 She's already got power over you。 She doesn't need to fuck you。 She's got power over you。

 You're her bitch。 I'm in control。 I've been the cause not the effect。

 I've been that the cause of my emotions not the effect。 Every moment is priceless。

 Every moment you don't get back Every moment。😡，Is a chance to be present to the moment。

 Every moment is a chance to say， this is amazing。Love every fucking moment be in the zone。

 F walking around with your emotions going up or down based on the girl。

 I want to ask you to evaluate yourself tonight， not on whether or not the interaction went well。

 but how positive you look when you came out of it。 and sure enough， what's gonna happen。😡。

Rationally what's going to happen rationally what's going to happen to your metric？

Your metric is you're going to get laid， and if you don't get late。

 you're going to have a way better night than you would have either way。

 So what I want you to realize is this。😡，It's up to you to control your mood。

 It's up to you to get into a mental state， Where the girls don't have power over you。

 And it's up to you to love yourself。 view every single interaction you do as an extension of you。

 Love it。 You could have a child iss disabled。 And a child is sharp。 You'd love them both equally。

 Every single approach is equal。 So I view every approach is 100 out of 1。

 And the reason why is because a， who the fuck would have the balls to do that。 say that with me。

 Who the fuck would have the ball is to do that。 Numb2。😡。

Who the fuck could have the ball to do that Sober。 Sa that。 that sober。 Yeah。

 because so few guys actually have the balls to take real action while sober。

 So don't think of it as like you did bad Because nobody actually has the ball to do it。

 And that's something like natural frankly got through of that natural kind of sociopath anyway。

 and it usually they're drunk So you're doing it sober Now。

 from there why do we do this Because any time that you didn't approach if you viewed it as bad and you go。

 like that， what happens to your mood， your mood will go down。

 Okay So if you're doing an approach and you're judging yourself and your mood is going down。

 I that helping you。 are you like， oh， well Yeah， know if I'm all like delusional。

 then I'm not gonna improve， how do I improve if I'm if I'm delusional， I say that was good。

 But most of game is just being in a great mood because when you're in a great mood， you act cool。

 You have a pickup that goes well or a pickup that goes bad。 It's your behavior。 It's your movement。

 You're a process。 love it。😡，Let me tell you something。

 do you want to be like one of these guys that gets success with no challenge， no effort， no context？

Do you think you'd appreciate success like that， would you acknowledge that any time that you have success？

It's a process through which you have many failures， and then at least towards success。Well。

 then why don't you love your failures equally， What would happen if you could just get girls whenever you want。

 just all the time。 Would you appreciate what you have。

When you look at the guy say like Justin Bieber， the pop star。

 I think he's actually probably way better guy than they would ever say in the media。 Okay。

 think a bullshit。 But the point being the stereotype of Justin Bieber。

Do you think that he enjoys getting laid on a deep level， do you think he wakes up every day like。

 God， I can have sex？This is so cool， God I have money and success， this is so cool。

 he's in a state of high gratitude， he might be。But if he's not。

 let's just say that he wasn't because we don't know fuck what the media says， right。

 but let's just say in theory by the media seereotype。Is he to state of high gratitude。 Well。

 if he's not， it's because he didn't have to go through a process to get it。 We value that。

 which we go through a process of challenge。 So that being the case。

 love every approach is just part of your journey。 You need the journey。 You need the bad approaches。

 Ba approaches are part of good approaches。 Good approaches are part of bad approaches。

For every side of the coin there's the other side of the coin。

 so love them allBeyond that it's about self love， self compassion。Don't go into self-attack。

 train yourself to love every moment and appreciate every moment because you're never gonna get that moment back。

 Do you know what I believe anytime you do anything， it's  a thousand out of 10。

 you do it'  a0 out of 10。 everything that you do in life because that puts your mood up。

 And when you're in a better mood， you're in empowered state at a resourceful state from which you take better action So even though it may be delusional。

 you wind up objectively doing better in the end。 So if you're truly maavilllian。

 you've got to give yourself a break you want to judge metrics judge the overall success。

 don't just judge yourself from action to action because otherwise you put yourself in a non- resourcesourceful state and then you become negative and you shuts you down instead of just like。

Giving yourself self love， not self attack。 And then from there you get better。 All right。

 so I want to wrap with some practical rubber means the road type ideas here。 And basically。

 I want to show you exactly how to implement what we've been focusing on， so。

You go into an interaction。And it goes bad， okay， it goes bad。When you come out。

 the first thing I want you to focus on is your demeanor。 Are you smiling。

 Are you finding something funny about it， Are you judging yourself or you giving yourself self love。

 And what I want you to do， How I want you to think about this is that。Come out。

It immediately default to finding something funny about the interaction。And giving yourself props。

Then what I want you to do is I want you to rate it a million。 Just like God， that was so cool。

 Just put yourself in that zone。 Then what I want you to do， though。

 is objectively look at it through the principles of successive women。

 And I want you to find something you could have done better about it while you're already initiated into that great state。

 So you find something you really like about it。 Then what you do is you end the feedback sandwich with how fucking great it was that you did that because who the fuck would have the ball to do that。

 So let me give you an example， Walk up to girl。 Does't go so well。😡。

What normal people would call doesn't go so well。 Personal， I call it warming up， expressing。

 And a moment in my life， I'm not gonna to get back that I'm so grateful for。

 But let's say it doesn't go so well in the eyes of a new pickup guy。 So you go in。

Doesn't go so well。 Walk out， You going。You see that。

 it's like even as I think about a bad directionion。是啊。😊，Wます。😀Ha。哎， no just。Like yeah。

 and it's not like。Like that it's not fake， it's real， it's like。

 are you telling me that in the mating dance between humans？🎼love the mammal so lets。

Like do discoveryYou can't see the humor in that， Of course you can。

 So find something funny about it， Okay， boom。Then what you do is you go。Like that。And then。

You gave yourself a little love， and then you go。Maybe we would have tweaked a little this。

 tweak a little intent， maybe a little needy there。

 Maybe he could have managed a friends a little better。 Maybe could have done this。

Just objective shit that you could have done better if you know game， you know what that is。

If you don't know game， then teach yourself。 So these videos are for。

 Then what you do those is you who the fuck would have the ball to do that。 That was the bomb。

 and you smile， and then you feel the club， you feel the environment， you feel the people。

 you feel presence inside yourself。And as you do this， you get into a great mood。

Immediately into the next wely lead， Lely lead， loud proclamations of where to go。

 I know we all I know we all and maybe it lost a bit too much， I agree。

 hate if you hate calm down and then washing giggles and hold while it's giggling。てやるの。聊天。It's under。

 it's going。Always judging yourself as positive。 It's called a feedback sandwich， right。

 Let's say you're gonna give me a feedback on this video。 If you want me to listen to it and help me。

 What would you say， You say， hey， own， great video。😊，You know。

 maybe you could have covered this in this。By the way， they'll really appreciate your video。

 Let's say that I got feedback like that。 I' be like， wow， thanks。 and I'd improve。

Put me in a great mood， make me want to do it again。

 and I'd improve it's called a feedback sandwich which is a basic teaching technique。Well。

 you'll use that on somebody else you care about。 But what about yourself。

 What I'm talking about here is self love。 Do you love yourself。 And above all else。

 I want you to go inside yourself and give yourself a fucking hug。😡，Ca you deserve it。

 And fundamentally， people who love themselves are loved by others。And objectively speaking。

 if you want to get great objective results in the game， you want your metrics to be high。

 You want to be gangster about it。 You want to get the best results possible。

 Then sometimes you've got to switch your metric from judging each little micro mechanic and becoming fucking sad and hating yourself。

😡，And instead， judging yourself positively and let the metric be your overall success at the end of the night when you're crushing it constantly while your friends who sit there butt hurt with their fucking thumb in their ass can't figure out how you're fucking killing it like this？

 I know that for me， Why is the other people in the club。

 walking around just just jointed and grumbling and pissed。 I'm just laughing having fun。

 And people going， Why is that guy having so much fun。But in reality。

 my actual conversation skills are no better than theirs。It's simply the fact I'm in a better mood。

 it's been a really long time since I've seen you。Yeah。

Fill the crff with cold water to your desired capacity， pour the water in the reservoir。

 add the desired amount of coffee to the filter， close the lid and turn the coffee maker on。所以我。

And me as well and me as well and me I really missed Yes where have you been。

 I always spent really long hours as mom hours。Butly love， the kids are lovely。You know， you know。

 the family it my god。You're probably seeing at this point that even though what I'm teaching you is about game or success with women。

A lot of this is also just my concern for you as a human being。I want you be happy。

I want you to have a fun life。In my opinion， even if you crush it with the girls， but you're unhappy。

 it doesn't count。You say， well， I crush you with girls， passive most people did。 Yeah。

 but what if you're unhappy。It doesn't count。I want you to be happy and crushed with girls。

 Some people think that it's a zero sum game It has's one or the other。 Yeah， that push yourself。

 Its on a limit。Oh， you're happy， but you don't get results。 I don't believe in that。

 That's fucking bullshit。😡，Ive higher ambitions than that。

 The ambition that I have for myself and for you is that you love yourself and you're happy and you get great results。

 And in my opinion， you don't need to fight a battle of self attack within yourself to do it。

So stop being a fucking asshole to yourself and treating yourself like shit because you wouldn't let someone else treat your friends like that。

 So you damn well shouldn't allow your brain to treat you like that。 You deserve better。

 You deserve results。 And get the best results possible。 This is how I teach it。 anyway。

 coming from a very loving and Macav alien space。😡，I love you and I want you to crush it。

 We've integrated the two here to get the best results that at least I know how to teach do it。

 do it make your dreams come true just do it。🎼，🎼因位。Get the results， make it happen。

 make your dreams come true like okay。Great inspirational message， right？

Does that work in your opinion？New Year's resolutions， I've resolved to do it。 You know what。

 fuck thinking about this shit。 I'm just going to do it。😡，Look， dude， here's what I think in reality。

 you've got。The goal that you want， the thing you're trying to do。And you try to do it。

 it doesn't fucking it happen。Why， because even though you think you couldt theory， you can't。

 you are fucking powerless。So what you got to do is you got to go around the goal， boom， boom， boom。

 boom， boom， boom， you handle these things， and all of a sudden the middle， it's easy。

That's what I'm getting at here when you love yourself。

 when you give yourself a fucking feedback sandwich， when you treat yourself with a fucking respect。

 it's easy to walk up to that studying girl laughing and smiling and having fun。

Most guys think it's all about what you're doing。In the moment。

But really it's what you're be doing in between the interactions。It's like， oh。

 I can just sit here like this hating myself and then， hi。Li fucking sucks， hello！

You know what friend that comes from， it's a self li。It's a lie that says， you know what。

 if I just got the girl， then I'd be happy， be happy first， love yourself first。

 then you'll get the girl and then you'll get love。Love yourself first still' take action。

A lot of people that are in that kind of hipppy， dippy shit of love yourself。

 they don't take fucking action。It's not hipppy dippy self love， it's not action solves everything。

 it's the merger between the two， it's loving yourself。But then beyond that， taking action。

 So you take that self love and you express it into the world and engage with people and then lead that into a win。

 win of you and the girl having sex， maybe becoming boyfriend and girlfriend。

 or however long it lasts。 So that's what the shit is about。 Okay， it's about merging the two。 do it。

啊。But also loving yourself So it's some more just like。To it。Hey， what's up， Owen， how's it going？

Because the girl doesn't want you to walk up to go， hi！Hi。Id like you。 That shit doesn't work。

 Women are put here on this earth to make us have fun， to make us love ourselves。

Because they provide an incentive。And what you'll realize is that when you actually start having fun and loving yourself。

 thiss gonna fucking awesome。 Anyway， I hope that makes sense。

 kind of a funny and dramatic way of explaining it。 And I'm off to head out again tonight。

 I'll talk to you soon。😊，Peace。啊，这个。Our steam。
