# RSD德里克-游戏十诫：1 主课：游戏十诫1.8 你要让性发生_ev (1)

🎼Commandment 8， thou shalt make this next habit。What will happen if this combatment is disobeyed？

You'll be having much of the sex by yourself。You'll be having the rest of the sex with lesser women and would have been happy to talk to you。

🎼A多 dating。Commandment explained。First， I want to make very clear again。

 this isn't a program of advocating idealism。I know many men out there aren't interested in a long term relationship at this point in their life。

No woman's going to be a perfect fit for you ever， but you should spend about 98% of your time together really enjoying your life。

 doing the things you would like to do。And if you selected the right partner。

 she should be able to do the same。Let me explain this。A lot of people talk about 50。

 50 relationships， there' this heritage。The relationship has to be give and take， give and take 50。

50。Full of compromise。Well， I'd rather get my dick caught in my zipper once every morning for the rest of my life than spend half of my fucking life in a state of compromise。

In your long term relationship， I want you to be with the type of woman that you can be exactly who you are and do exactly what you want about 98% of the time and that she can be exactly who she is and do exactly what she wants about 98% of the time。

Now that other 2% for each of you， if something comes up or something's very important to her。

 and it's not so important to you， it wouldn't be your natural preference。

It's just easy to compromise， for instance， if she had a family reunion to go to for some sort of work event that you really couldn't give a shit about。

 but for her it's kind of a big deal she'd like you to come with her。Go go with her。

 I don't say a damn word about it， don't be resentful， don't be fussy， just go with her。

 help the girl have a good time。No need for bitterness， no need to say a single word。

She knows when you're making those concessions， it's not a bad thing。

And a couple percent of her time she'll spend making concessions for you when she knows the economics are reverse。

 when she knows something's important to you， what be her natural preference。

 it'll be easy for her to go with the float。I don't want you to begin these relationships where a significant percent of your time。

You're doing things you don't want to do。It's not healthy。

 it's back to that path towards growing resentments。🎼Ging contempt。

And event will break up you don't want to do this shit。

 really don't want to do this shit as you get older， people have kids， they have property in common。

 bank accounts in common。All sorts of life problems that arise down the road。

Because you didn't screen for the right partner from the Bu can。

 don't put yourself in these compromised cases。And look man at the same time when you're traveling somewhere or you're just out fucking around at home and you run into some girl but probably 60% of what you wish she was。

 you're probably not her ideal probably either， but even if you are you can't stay with her long term you guys may having a good time and you're just having a fun life experience by all means go hook up with the girl work up to your heart's content。

Cobeing 0 of those girls if you want to， you have a great time doing it。

 let them have a great time doing it， I'm just saying don't get into a relationship with the girls that you're not long term compatible with。

ことわけ that。It's fine to have one night stands with carols that are 60% of who you wish they were。

 there are 84% of what you wish they were， that's fantastic have a great sign。If it's good enough。

 keep her as your f buddy， but realize that she's a f budty。

 realize that some girl that you're seeing in the short term and don't treat it like pumpkinump is not。

A lot of court masters get themselves in a situation where they start rationalizing it's a good idea that you know。

 oh， oh， she， you know， she'll change or this will change or she'll be beautiful forever so I can overlook her multitude of personality disorders。

まったよね。Just be objective， get fun with girls who are fun girls。

Nothing wrong with short term relationships， nothing wrong with midterm relationships。

Just don't get yourself into a long term relationship with you wrong type of person。

You don't want to deal with the consequences of that。

It's totally avoidable so do itMoving on Look topic of sex has been covered in many books。

 many programs， millions of pages， everybody's thought about it， we all of human history。

 we won't be able to cover it in extreme detail in one commandment it would take  a00 hour program by itself get a deep scratch needed surface and really dig in on this topic。

However， I do want to offer you a lot of best practice kit and get you thinking the right way about this topic。

Your default thought about S should be。That it's the natural thing that happens when a man and a woman like each other。

 how treat sex like it someone unusual or exotic happening。

Quite literally just the natural thing that happens when a man and a woman like each other。

They're having a good time， that's what they tend to do that's why we're all here right now be aware though in nearly all circumstances the man is expected to physically lead these interactions。

Physical security from a quality man is very attractive to women。

This is a core component of masculinity。Despiteite what you may hear or read in mainstream media。

Women still love men or will continue to love men well past our lifetimes。

Women really despise indecisive men。Charity has all the insecurity and indecisiveness she needs in her life。

 she doesn't need any more from her math。Women prefer a man to add a sense of security。

 some meaning and security to their lives。IfYou're waiting for a beautiful woman to leave you。

 have your credit card ready。But the only place you going to take to you is shopping for something expensive。

Our next best option is just to find a confident man。

The only women that are going to consistently lead you are inferior women。

They tendend to be women that are old or fat， to be sure momrate。

Maybe some woman who has kids or mental or physical disability。

 some other form of extraordinary packageage。Somethingbody that would make her less desirable to the type of man that she'd really like to be with。

Heal like even in those circumstances， he's substituting for inferior goods had her preference。

Just the best information she can get。Maybe some super tamid or indecisive woman she might leave you。

 maybe someone who is so timid or so indecisive， but by comparison Harris and she looks at you as being quite bold。

If that's the type of thing you're into， you and her can be indecisive together while she volunteers to clean poop at a homeless shelter and beads up on vegan political philosophy。

🎼Occasionally， a beautiful woman's can open you， and they frequently give approach invitations。

 That's great， Anne。 But don't wait up for this shit。

The per is going to be consistently on the man to approach。

 entice and lead the woman to the path he's on。If she's not with it。

 go and find another one that's better for you。 Just let her go， let her go， keep it moving。

 I'll reiterate again here。If you're interested in sex with a woman。

 let her know that from the beginning， be careful how you're framing your relationships You don't want to be one of these nice Gu fellas that she thinks you're going to watch her puppy and clean her litter box while she goes on vacation with a guy she's actually having the sex。

Make sure it's clear from the beginning， you're the guy that she's going to have sex with。

 you don't have room in your life to just be friends。

Any relationship youd have with a woman is going to be sexual in nature。Or you just can't do it。

 setting expectations one way and violating them later can lead to a breakup really fast。

More on this in my exclusive 10 Commandments of game interview with Julian。One more note on podcast。

If you see her f buddy more than once a week， she thinks you're in a relationship。

If you want to keep her around， you don't want to commit a relationship。

 fight the limit to that three to four times a month， about once a week。

Gragmatic application of this commandment。Never be judgmental about her sexual past。And if you are。

 sure as hell， don't let her know。If you have the same sexual options that she's presented with。

 how much sex would you have had by now？Beauti girl in a big city gets get on about 20 times a day when she goes outside。

🎼If you had women hitting a new 20 times a day。Every day of your life。

 every time you walk outside and just go about your business， going to work， going to VM。

 getting some groceries carrying on with your life， if you had 20 women a day getting on you。

 how many of them would you have had sex with？Het lot more than her。

Whatever your thoughts or judgments about it， girl doesn't want to be judged for indulging the few times she does cook up with some guests。

There's nothing wrong with casual sex man， like I said。

 it's just an expression when a man and a woman are having a good time together。

 it's just a natural continuation， a natural expression。Of their thought and intimacy。

When you get judgmental of it， all you're doing is teaching your girl to lie to you。

 you're training her to be a liar， and you're putting it in their head to you how you can be judgmental of a lot of other things。

What highly increase the probability of your girl is going to go cheat on you and get her needs met somewhere else。

 Co man De Judge Mannel。It's great to use for thinking invain to judge a lot of things。

 and you may come to the conclusion in your own mind when you find out more about her that she's lived a lifestyle that you think seem compatibleible with you and you don't want to carry your things forward。

Don't make a big deal about past path and you make a big deal a out of sex in general。

 judge people for their past sexual exploits and make them feel self conscious about this topic。

She's not going to be having sex with you to find somebody else's cler accept the first way she is。

Another bullet plant， a lot of girls are very comfortable doing whatever they perceive is comfortable for you。

This is why it says when you acting judgmentmental。

 you' putting into those set of anchors in your mind like sex is a big deal or。

She shouldn't have done this， so you don't like a woman that you have like this for that。F。

' finally to have those opinions， but again keep them to yourself prim。

All you're doing is putting up barriers between you having more sexual options。

You'd rather go have those sexual options， you'd rather go at least tell you the truth so you can make an informed decision if you want to have those sexual options or not。

 if you want to carry those options forward or not。When you act aman up front。

 you're closing down on her ability to tell you the truth before closing that avenue。

You're encouraging her to live you， you're encouraging her to be deceitful， and she will。

She's been charged by other men before。She knows this past， she's seen this way before。

Note just what you do， you're going to lie at you saying't forget a needs met by somebody else。

You know if she spends any time with you at all， there's going to be that little boy and I she's like。

  hmm。You're probably a placeholder， you're probably a temporary somebody in her life until she finds something bigger and better and more down the road。

You don't want to put yourself in that position， just be cool math。

You should be normalizing physical contact with the woman either from the home or very soon after。

And you go to lead her around the environment later。

 which a new environment is much easier for her to follow leave。

Your default behavior should be to start moving the woman around early in the interaction。

Perhaps two to 8 minutes after meeting， depending on the contract。

If you open thisstruct and command the three。She knows you're interested in getting to know her and likely open minded having sex with her later。

 should be shock into her， be the lead her to the dance floor or lead her to meet your friends or to go meet her friends proactively or to give her a drink。

These are just fundamental normal elements of the human matn ritual。

When you find little fictionction points， be persistent。

 but make sure you're not crossing the line into neediness or forcefulness Per systemsence is very attractive。

 it allows the girl to know if you think she's special you think that she's a really cool girl and that you might not be that excited about any girl that you meet find that various laddering and if you call up the steps from Commandments1 through7。

You' be getting to this point in your interaction very frequently you happening all the time you happening at least every night below。

Meaninginess， however， is universally discussed。She has no choice but to leave your presence if you behave that way。

She feels that you're not entitled enough to be with a woman like her。

She knows that if she went somewhere private of you， she might be really uncomfortable。

 She might feel pressure to do things she doesn't want to do psychological pressure。

 if not physical pressure， It might even be very dangerous for her。

 She don't know what kind of crazy shit could happen。🎼You start acting needy。

 She knows it's a big deal。 She knows it's a rare opportunity for you。

 And that means that other women like her in the past have decided against you。

 And that's a really powerful heuristic for her。 She has to follow their lead instead of yours。

 Be persistent， Never needy or forceful。Read the physical cues right too If she won't follow you 10 feet in the club。

 it's like three meters。Youith think you have a short term logistical obstacle to overcome。

 or the girl probably isn't having sex with you tonight。It's a logistical obstacle。

 East Mark be tax will deal with that shit。If it's an attraction， obstacle。

🎼Read that play early and go find somebody else that's really excited to meet you。

 Let her qualify y or let her get screened out。 More on that in a minute。

A couple other tips on moving the girl。If you've moved her around the club， add a cr or two。

And direct about your sexual interests。Maybe danced a bit， seated the pole properly。

 met her friends proactively， and are respected by or even leading her group now。

Introduce her to your friends and have a pleasant experience with them。

 basically meaning that your friends aren' in creeps and they treat you respectfully。

 and not like hittinging not her while she's with you。We're doing some other kind of fucking weird。

 bizarre shit with her。You took the time to listen about her life and build a sincere connection。

 you gave her enough information about your life， who you are， what you're about， etc cea。

But she feels comfortable that she knows you well， and she knows that time spent with you would be a great experience。

And then probably you kiss the girl when not a hardcore makeup just enough to have lip to lip contact a couple times。

Maybe brief makeout probably you the makeout showed in the club。

Get the lift to lift contact so it sets expectations for what's going happen when you leave together but when you make out。

 make out， make out in the club you see guys do that and to an inexient sky it looks amazing it's like oh he's been kissing that girl for 20 minutes like they're definitely going home together No man probably they're not Probably her friends are gonna show up going say okay Stacey it's time to go she can't be like all right bye bye。

'Cause she already got all the validation that she wanted from that guy。

 she knows she could have him， he's no longer her prize。

 the social pressure of telling her friends that she's going with them。

 this isn't worth the experience that she would have with。

It's not going to be an emotionally relevant enough experience。

He's released all the punchtop sexual energy that she had in any hisquiak that he had。

Through all that make out， make out， make out。So the path of least resistance for her is a spell balance。

If you really had a fun adventure to give of her。And you've executed well on that list。

And the information and Commandments 1 through7。Itd be very normal for you to be leaving the club for sex in about 20 to 80 minutes。

About 40 minutes financial。Our mentor is death and the day would talk to us four to 10 hours spent with the girl。

 about seven hours on average before Se。Fuck that I made the new normal 80 minutes。

 I've done it hundreds of times， leave the club around 40 minutes or for sex to happen within two hours。

ButThat's not happening in your life。Talking to the wrong girls and they don't perceive you as compelling enough。

 many of my clients and assistants have replicated this consistently。

If you've got a year's experience and you're aren't getting these results， you're not doing it right。

Remember that sex is a very emotional experience for a woman。

 especially for the first time with a new man， don't attempt to logically convince her or persuade her to be the source of her emotions and leader。

If you've done your job well， you should have minimum or no less kind of existed。

Let's talk while last minute at uses。B minute resistance when you take your girl home。

Kappens for a couple of reasons。Eer is a function of intergruence in your interactions since you left the club。

 some logistical failure that you didn't take care of earlier。

 usually something to do with her peer group。Or oftentimes also a failure to set expectations in advance。

The common things that have happened here is you either gett understand her logistics。

 you live too far away and it's inconvenient for her to come。Did't deal with her friends optimal。

 now they're calling her and creep out。You told her you were going to an after party instead of being honest。

 they were just going back to your place。Let's unpack that one specifically for just a moment is this a problem that like Leonardo DiCaprio or Choing Tad。

 I'm Taddy and Choing， whatever his name is， this is a problem that like a superstar celeopardty man would have。

This is a problem that high value men have that you have to say， hey， after party。

 after party and like life of the girl， if they're just going back to their hotel or to their home。

Well guess what， those guys are just humans too。If you're having that problem and they're not。

 it's simply a function of her perceived value of who you are talk about this more in a bit。

Back to that list， I now Lamar。Other things that caused Ellen and Mar。

 he backed incongruently after she left the glove between you。

 you overga her and it came off his desk。🎼You' talking now。And you let the fun emotions can。

Came home to a disgusting place， it doesn't have to be a manion man small or fine， but if it's gross。

 she's likely to feel a girl team there。she feels that way。

 she doesn't want to bang the guy who's the source of those negative emotions your housemates are hassles and flul it up。

You don't have a condo。We choose Camp sex with the time。🎼Hes used insect sex with the condom。

 She really wants another drink， and you don't have any alcohol at home。

She lost or dropped her phone and couldn't find it。And you couldn't turn that around。

 Her friend is some form of infant or buffoon。 It must be babys， like a child。

Her friend is a jealous bit and if she's not having a ton of fun。

 no one can have fun there's thousands and more situations that come up like this these are just some common ones。

Make sure you're thoughtful about these， make sure you're setting expectations in advance。

 you'll mitigate these problems dramatically Logistics are immensely important。

 your sex life in the long term will not be limited because you ran out of things to say where you couldn't get a pretty woman attracted to you in the long run。

 90% of your mental energy will be about solving logistics and making it easy for her to do what you and her both want to do。

On the topic of value and qualification。Back in the day。

 we spoke a lot about a simple strategy of picking up girls， value and qualification。First。

 the value component。Value in this context simply means conveying to her that you are useful to helping her accomplish her goals。

In a night Love， this universally means a fun and emotionally relevant experience。

It might also mean another drink， some food， good sex。A really cool actual after party。

 a place nearby at this day is that she doesn't have to deal with a long term commute right now。

 but so she doesn't have to go home in bad weather。Like a rainstorm or a snowstorm。

It might mean drugs， I be just the validation from spending time with a cool guy。Emotional intimacy。

For any number of other things that she' perceives as cool， useful。

 or enhancing to her self image of that moment。Qualification component。

Qualifying the girl means you're making sure she's investing in you along the way and not just wasting your time or other resources。

Remember。If you don't value your time， don't value your life。

She should know that your time is precious and she should be treating it respectfully。

She should be showing her enthusiasm and reasonable investment in the experience we're having together。

Forms of qualification or investment。When you squeeze her hand。

 she squeezes back with similar pressure when you kiss her， she kisses bat。She kisses you。

When this app end remember to be the first one to pull away a few seconds later。

 when you're leader through the environment。She's attentive and psychologically present with you。

 she's eagerly compliant。She laughs at her jokes。Chica meant recent since。

She is actively solving logistical issues for you。She expresses that she's excited to meet you and has been looking for a guide。

There are a multitude of other behaviors that women show in this painting。

Things that indicate that she's into you and down to follow your leave。

So what do you do with failure and qualification？Be aware of Fiman from the very beginning of your interaction。

Maybe taking responsibility as the leader of your life， you know who you are， what you want。

 who you want to spend your time with。Did you open like Umina？

Are you handling logistics and social dynamics intelligently？

Or you can your sincere identity without fear of judgment？

Are you bringing relevant emotions and fun to the interaction for leaching like a fucking pear。

We made attempts to lead the girl or the group to experience a really cool adventure with you。

If you follow the first seven Command mins dutifully。

 you might try one more time to lead the woman to do whatever you want to do next。

If she isn't a good fit for you， hoping'll find someone who wins。

If you havent follow the first seven Commandments。Stop this shit and do it right next time。

 stop getting on the way of your own success。If you're 10 minutes in and not seeing any type of these qualification indicators。

Doby doesn't perceive you as very valuable。Albs be raising your value so it's more obvious to the world that you are someone worth throwing。

It makes it way easier for others to qualify as you and want to join your group and follow your lead。

We're on this in Commandments9 and 10。Next， let's talk about compliance over enthusiasm。

Enthusiasm is great。If the girls are really excited to be talking to you， she's very animated。

 maybe she's touch you， she's giving you some of those indicators that she's excited and qualifying in and investing。

 fantastic。Fantastic。However。If after giving those indicators when you try to move the girl and say。

 hey， come meet my friend， hey， let's go grab a drink， hey where are your friends at。

 let's go make sure they're okay。She's hesitant to follow your lead， try to throwret that out。

 try to understand what the logistical issue is。Do you know what？

Sometimes they're just really enthusiastic。It's not going anywhere。

 she's just having a fun emotional experience with you for a moment。

 even if you've had expectations of who you are or what you want， she's not going to be with it。

she don't want to tell you， she's literally using you for your personality。

 she's having a fun time so she's enthusiastic。Seeingly investing wherever there's no compliance。

The B simply means she's willing to follow your review。Now it's awesome to have both。

 you have to have to when you have both， but if you have to choose one or the other。

 you pick compliance every time。You you rather have an enthusiastic woman。

 who refuses to follow your lead， or would you rather have a woman who maybe is a little more reserved or a little bit more stoic and when you take her hand？

Start moving， she just keeps coming with you。You go grab the drink， you go dance， meet her friends。

 she meets your friends。Maybe there's not a ton of enthusiasm， but she is follows your lead。

 By the end of the night， you're going to lead her back to your place。

 She's going to sit on the corner of your bed。 She's going to take her shoes off。

 She's going to lay down under your bed。 you don't know what to do next。 You're hopeless。

Fantastic when you have compliance and enthusiasm， but value the compliance over enthusiasm。

Next a bit on the topic of sexually receptive versus sexually aggressive women。

 I touched on this briefly earlier。On occasion a woman's going to open you directly or she's going to come next to you。

 just place herself proximate to you and or make eye contact with you and give you approach invitations no matter who you are。

 very few women are going to be sexually aggressive with you On the other hand。

 a lot of women are very sexually receptive you may not have stood out to the extent that they notice you and they feel so damn compelled about you that they have to come open you。

If you showed up and opened them and you're done things we've talked about。

 she'd be extremely receptive to meeting a guy like you。

Guys that are waiting for this eye contact after approach invitations。

 producing more than 90% of girls that have been delighted to have sex with you if you just interrupted their life for the better。

Had a fun time， let the interaction and let nature run its course This is another way that a lot of guys are getting them the way of their own success。

Don't let it be you next on the topic of pacing and be。

This is concept and pickup of meetinging her where she's at and then slowly trying to steer her shift away and lead her down your path。

As pros and cons to this， the pros first，s a terrible short term strategy for avoiding topics of conflict with a girl。

 you don't really like tremendously anyway， but you're sexually attracteded to and would like to have sexbook。

Caaviat， this works so long as your communication isn't so neutered that you failil to create real attraction。

This might help you get you buy a more tone down and relatable version of your sincere self。

It won't work when you get to the place of sonude or that you don't express any sincere opinions。

 but then it's back to the place where she doesn't know who you are or what you want。

 she's not going to be very attractive。This is a fine strategy to spend a bit more time around a woman who you think you may be very compatible with。

you disagree on some superficial things that you're sure she's incorrect about。

 but you think she changed your mind readily if she simply spent more time around you。

It was more educated on the topic。跳好看啊。Take a lot of discipline and self awareness to do the above。

More than almost any human man。Sounds good in theory。

 but in practice will almost certainly lead to rationalalizations in subpar relationships。

You're welcoming people into your life that you already know might not be the best fit for you。

If you violate your core values and let these people into your life for relationships。

Those relationships will fail down the road， you'll be living a hell of a lot closer to a 5050 relationship。

And the 98 in2 relationship。It's all the scheme is going to be lowered because of this。

You'll either stay in this mediocre or bad relationship where you'll break up having spent months。

 years or decades in a lesser relationship than you could have had。

I have a much stronger opinion on this topic than anyone I've ever met to tell you why。

 when you behave the way that I recommend， you're going to end up with more sex partners and higher quality sex partners。

I pacing a leading ship， that's because girls that really like guys like you。

Know who you are and gravitate to you quickly。Girl who would have been on the fence。

If you are more agreeable， get very excited about your confidence to pass their shit test and your firmness on your own path。

They'll look up with you and even try to date you because they see you is much more compelling than any normal diet。

Most attractive girls will also really have their life together。Would never be dating some a do。

 but they would gladly date guys like me to even go out of their ways to find guys like us。

Because she has so many options。She needs to be with a guy who has a strong identity and a strong personality。

It doesn't fit into her salt concept to just be with some normal do， more on shit test。

These shit tests or congruence tests are your friend。Lis with them proactively。

This is the most effective speeding tool of all time， there's no quicker way to create attraction。

Congruence and continuity creates trust and overcomes the need for a more ship vest。

There's no faster path from meeting to feeling like you're intimately connected and on the same team and to pass the shit test。

If you leave， you just want to have the chunk of time in your youth experience。If she stay。

 he've gotten further towards her trusting you and feeling attracted to you in past minute than her orbiter showeds have in the past year。

 literally。Is that a better tool in pickout to amp up traction than actively eliciting shit tests？

Being non reactive。Infirming your identity and she calls you out on something then blowing right past that shit is' not a quicker way for her to get on the same team。

 get on your page and follow your lead， than to develop the art and the skill。

They need hurt to ship tests to you， passing those tests。Being a fun and emotionally relevant person。

 a strong leader。What are I thinking about phone number？Well。

 the okay time to get a phone number is after steps。

I went through a five year period where I took two phone numbers， PS。

I got paid more in that five years than any other period of my life。

Let me tell you a little bit more about this。See， I have a lot of frustrating situations where'm meeting the girls。

 have a nice conversation， you spend 20 minutes， you spend 30 minutes。

 is a nice to meet you and they carry on with their life。I had enough goddamn nice to meet you。

 If you were deep enough into a conversation or had a compelling enough communication with a woman and she's offering up her phone number。

You're not too far away from getting to the sex man。

For a lot of these girls have phone number just a rejection strategy， however。

 and don't be confused between the two， let me explain this。

For a lot of girls in that emotional moment， she is excited to meet you， she gets you a number。

 et cetera， etc cea。But then you call her back the next day， two days later you send her a text。

And like she's changing like her cat litter you know。

 she has got done doing her laundry Gu the hell knows what happened in her life。

 she's been doing homework work all day she's doing some mundane shit and on one hand you think like that's a great time to hit her up because she be super excited talk to me Well yeah maybe but the guys that I've seen him managing these phone numbers the past you're a superstar if you're closing 20% A lot of these guys is just abysmal they're closing near zero% single digits Again。

 the guys who are experts at closing numbers because who are experts at converting numbers into sex。

Spend 1 thousand hours or more thinking about it， for closing 20%。

Let's go back to my take on this Well， if you got to that expert level where you're closing 22% by taking the phone number and following up。

 what if you just data them the interaction？Could you not close like a third。

 could you not close 40%， if you just push the interaction till the end。

 only that ego go get in the way and take the short term path of these resistance of getting that phone number when in reality if you just push the interaction harder。

 a lot of those girls would have came with you instead。And then back to this。

 like what the old have this problem？You were really a star would you have protective type problems？

Well， again， it's just a human， just a human that she knows his brand name。
