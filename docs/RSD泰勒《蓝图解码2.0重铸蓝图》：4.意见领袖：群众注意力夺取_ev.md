# RSD泰勒《蓝图解码2.0重铸蓝图》：4.意见领袖：群众注意力夺取_ev

🎼这里是社交光谱，我是莱特，欢迎来到泰勒20年的精华大课蓝图解码2。0。那么想要了解课程的一个更新动向，请关注我们的公众号。社交光谱，开始我们今天的内容，社交媒体的时代，如何成为一个有影响力的意见领袖。

以及如何通过个人的魅力和能量来感染他人。Saying here is that。A couple points， a。

 if you want to be a social media influencer。The biggest thing these days if you want to know the truth is volume of content。

 I hate to say it， but it's kind of true。😡，Okay， that's one aspect。

 So to be able to make a lot of postings with your list， you've got to be able to communicate。

 But remember this， most of your list， they like you as a person， whatever you talk about。

 they want to watch。 I've got people who I follow that I think are awesome。

 whatever they're gonna talk about， I'm gonna watch them。 You know why。

 because in my mind through the computer screen， they're my best friend。😡。

Anybody here feel that way about different people you watch。

 So when you're watching that and you're creating content， just remember， a lot of people。

 they like your energy。 They like what they're getting from you energetically。

 And the content is just an excuse。 One great example。

 I think maybe one of the best ever is Anthony Robbins。

 Anthony Robbins is perhaps the greatest motivator in human history。 And yet。

 if I were to ask you right now， what are the six human needs。😡。

Can anybody here even name his most basic teaching？😡，Certainty， uncertainty， loves significance。

 you guys remember this is six human needs， It's his most basic teaching。 We all love Tony Robins。

 who doesn't love Tony Robbins， right， the world he is beloved across the world except apparently with certain factions these days that write nasty articles about him。

😡，But you know but aside from like you know because you he's too positive or whatever。

 but the point is like right well positive energy is gonna to attack negative detractors。

 but the main point being such a positive inspirational personal world class motivator。

 but when you watch Tony you can't remember the six human needs but you just know this when you watch Tony for some reason you want to go get something done when you watch Tony for some reason you want to defy the odds。

 You don't even know why you just do you're gonna defy the odds。 Tony Robins even has incantations。

 he teaches it unleash the power within I can't remember like I said， I can't remember them。

 but I remember some。 It's like defy the odds， I'll be the voice。

 I'll create and not destroy I can't let's step up， so do you remember any of the rest。

 I can't remember they're so good。 Yeah， set the standard right you know it's funny。

 when you think look at those basic things he teaches at UPW his event that he does set the standard。

 be the voice Cate， don't destroy what was the other one I said say we can't even remember what was the other one。

I will believe it not doubt， I don't know， whatever it was， right。

 but what's funny is you can't even remember like I've been to his event， okay。

 think about that for a minute。😡，Half of UPW was just yelling that。

 It's literally just like on the voice， right Like time number 2000 on the voice。

 Now jump the voice And that's like you do that here everyone。 You know， pick one， right。

 but what's funny if you actually look at those incantate。 Like it works。

 I went to one of his events in 2004。 My next 1 I went to was actually 2014。

 I went to UW later date with Dstiny。 And what was funny about it was I saw those incantations from UPW 10 years later。

 Id even thought about them I was like， wow， I've really lived that to a very high extent compared to what I would have this guy subconsciously program me。

 Well what's funny is this。 when you look at Anthony Robins and you look at his energy because bring it back to you。

 When you look at Anthony Robins， you look at his energy。

He embodies those things that he teaches like you get you don't even have to say it。

 you just feel it from him so when he talks， you just feel that I hope that what you feel from me is this kind of devilma carere attitude of sort of I guess you'd almost call it a irreverence you guys ever feel when you see me you feel sort of like do you guys know the word irreverence it means that it means that you just have fun just doing what you want and you actually might even find negative feedback almost as funny。

😡，You see that， like when you see me， can you imagine me out having some approach that I did doesn't go so well。

 and not only does it not bother me， but I actually kind of find it hilarious。😡。

RightAnd when you watch me just from my demeanor， you probably get some of that energy right。

 you know， you feel like you can kind of step up， you can beat the odds。 you can do what you want。

 you can be who you want to be。 You can express yourself。

 You don't need to worry what others think so much。

 that's a lot of what I teach So just watching me talk ideally I hope you're gonna be getting that vibe from me So whatever I'm gonna talk about whether it's my drive here。

 whether it's about my fingernails See I'm talking about my fingernails。

 but am I really talking about my fingernails or is what I'm doing is I'm actually by talking about so many aspects of the fingernails and being so expressive and being so into it and even into myself almost like narcissistically kind of lankking it to my own fingernail story。

😡，RightI had one of the best compliments I got from a girl I'm dating。 She started watching my video。

 She's like， I feel like you look like you're wking yourself off the screen。 I was like， thank you。

 That is such a wonderful compliment。 self-love， right So I remember So I remember So when you're watching me。

 you're getting a piece of my energy。 It doesn't matter that much what I'm talking about。

 So if I'm talking to somebody who I'm meeting or who I'm networking， I don't view it。

 then it really matters what I'm talking about。 if they like that energy that I have。

 if they think that's cool， they like that kind of energy。

 they're learning unconsciously You're learning unconsciously from seeing me speaking to a group of people and just having the balls to even do what I do。

 Do you know how much like like how like the audacity that I have to even like put out YouTube videos and be like it's own。

 what we're gonna talk about today is this as if it's so awesome and they be like now you're gonna come to hear me talk in a room and you're gonna pay me Like there's an audacity to that。

 then I'm gonna go approach all these people and they're all gonna think I'm awesome And the one。

I don't care there's something to that。 You're like this guy's crazy man is this guy' out of his mind but then you're like I could do that。

 I could do that too when you're out say a big one is letting go。

 when you can just let go and not care what people think and be yourself and just pump energy。

 It makes other people feel like they could also let go That's the power behind it。

 they feel I could let go too So a lot of what you're doing in my mind Let's say that you're gonna make sales。

 Let's think about some of the energy that you want to show in making sales。

 you want to have a sense of urgency。 Part of why I'm really effective at sales。

 is that if you look at the way my energy is not in all my speaking， but in a lot of it。

 particularly if I'm doing sales， I put in this crazy sense of urgency if you guys ever seen that Did you guys see the first couple sales videos that I did for this event。

What I do my sales video for this event， Do I go， here's some sales training for you， Do I go， hey。

 what's up。's On， you know， really been enjoying creating the new four days self help event。😊。

I think you get a lot out of it too， so if you want to sign up， just check it out。See in there。 Now。

 here's this's funny。 There's a side of me that is like that。

 for any of you guys that know me outside of seminar are speaking。

 that's what I look like a lot of the time， right， You know， you'd see me to expect me that。

 What's up， let's go， come on， right？ I'm like， I'm just like， what you know， you're like， Tyler。

 I'm like， like， what are we gonna to do。 We got to run through a wall at the Kai man， I'm like。

I'm chill andbro。 You know right。 You're like， you just look like a normal guy right but I know how to switch that on because if I'm speaking in a way that's hyper urgent then I make a video about it。

 which is a sales video。 that feeling of urgency。 We need change。 We need to move。

 We need to be bold。 That's a lot more leading towards somebody putting their credit card into into a sales processor than being super chill right I have people who I've worked with that are too chill。

 I've rarely seen salesmen that are ultrala back。 I know they exist。

 There's always an example of something it's like the drunken kung fu master right most of people doing kung fu drunk bad。

 but there's always that one drunken kung fu master that totally he's gonna do even better kung fu wasted because he's the drunken kung fu master know。

 there's always like like that super anomaly guy that isn't sharp as attack right but most great salesmen。

 You know who they look like。 ever seen the guy that the straight line persuasion Jordan Belfor from the movie the Wole Wall Street。

😡，First thing he says in sales training is you've got to look sharp as attack。

 sharp as attack like you know within a millisecond。

 the second of that video comes on whether or not this person's worth listening to and whether or not they know their niche。

 what they're going to talk about What I do， by the way。

 a little trick we'll get in this later you want a quick practical tip when I start my videos I give myself three entry points to get to being sharpest attack。

 here's what I do Hey， what's up is entry point number one on the video。😡。

It's owe it is entry point number2。 The company I'm from is entry point number 3。

 And what we're gonna to talk about today is entry point number 4。

 This is for post productionion for editing。 Okay， what I'll do is when I hit the note。

 like when I lock in， that's where I start the video。 If you watch my videos， I mean。

 it's pretty intense。 Okay， When you see it， because it looks like I'm that switched on all the time。

 I'm not。 But if you look at it。 like。😡，Wat look at the runningtting start that I would gain。😡，Okay。

 watch this， okay？😡，Say we look at like just the most recent sales video。So on this one。

 I go wait on what you're gonna to， let's see what I went in on。

the first so we went so we start out what we're going to be doing right now that was my starting point watch。

Okay， now right now even as I'm sitting here。😡，Look how hard it is to start with that ch in the voice。

What we're going to be doing right now。Do you see how try saying that what we're going to be doing right now。

 See if you can get it as crisp as I have it。In the video， it's hard。 I can't even do it something。

 but I just want you to try it so you can see how hard it is。 Okay， try it right now。😡，What。Right？

What we going we do it right now。Yeah。種だ。Every you。I've been building。出问题。我。now now watch， pause。

 Okay， so watch right now so watch this。 okay， watch how Christmas starts off into the。Preview。

We're gonna to be doing right now shooting what we're gonna be doing right now It's hard to get in that crisp。

 Sometimes I do。 Usually you'll be that crisp when you're in momentum right now。

 I'm beginning getting to get in momentum。 We're at the start of our event together。

 So for that reason I'm beginning to get motoring right a couple hours in。

 I'm gonna be in full swing。 I'll be in full flow。 So if I'm doing the video。

 I need a minute to get to that energy。 So I'll do is say，y what's up。

 it's own from RD and what we're gonna be doing right now。 at one of those four points。

 I'm gonna crack in。 So if I get it on， hey， what's up， I'll leave in hey。

 what's up because it came in crisp。 That's classic of Jordan Belfort right there because I know。

 look， I'm not gonna reshoot the middle point of the video over and over But I'm not gonna necessarily reshoot the end。

 although that is the second most important The beginning is the most important。

 the end is actually the second most because it leaves the impression that the person leaves the video with。

 But I'll tell that  one I also view is high priority。 But the start of the video。

 that's gonna determine whether or not you're buying yourself a couple more seconds for people to watch。

😡，Right， anything that you're doing in communication。

 you're basically just trying to buy a couple more seconds， everything you're doing。

 you're using sales to get them through the first five seconds。

 You're selling them on the next 10 seconds， you're selling them on the next minute。

 You're selling them on the next few minutes， Okay You're selling， selling， selling， selling。

 selling。 Why is that human beings， we have limited time and energy， and for that reason。

 we're always trying to save time and energy。 So if you're not being sold on paying attention in that next bit。

 It's not gonna to work。 even the introduction that I gave you here today， that there was sales。

 Do you understand that。😡，That introduction that I gave you is sales。

 I'm trying to get you to buy in and lock in for the next four days。

 I'm trying to sell you on the idea that paying attention for the next four days will help you。

 I mean， you need to think about this。 I've got four days of your time and your money right now。

 That is a lot of resources that I'm getting for me。 That is no joke。😡。

I just got the money that you gave for this is nothing。 Think about the time you gave for this。

 What could you have made money wise in that four days。 Your life is a limited time span。

 What could you have done in that four days？ There's so many things you could have done to not be here。

 Do you know how hard it is to get someone to give up that time。

 There's so many think of all the videos that you could watch。 You know。

 one of the main things I do with my instructors that I do all the time。😡，It's pretty vulgar。

 what I do。😡，Is I load up？A porn sight， okay？And I leave some crazy sex scene runningtting。

And then what I do is I put their video beside it， and I say until my staff is watching your video over this。

 you got to redo this。😡，Okay， I view it if I'm making a video。

 I view it like like you have literally unlimited amount of adult film on the internet that people can watch for free。

 and they're gonna to watch you。 they can be watching world class athletes political commentators and getting themselves all riled up and angry。

 They they can be watching much a negative clickba news to fulfill their low vibration energy needs。

 they could be watching something inspirational。 They can be watching a Hollywood production。

 How are you going to get them to watch you So there's other aspects of that I'll get into that later。

 We're gonna build that together。 But the first one is you've just got to get it to the point where they're even going pay attention。

 So I know that in that first few seconds， they're very， very liable to switch that video off。

 So what I'm gonna to do is I've got to get them through a 30 second to 90 second intro and then jump to some other jump cut in the past I would use infield and then get them through that。

 And now what you're doing is you're adding good energy。

 Then what you wanting to do is get them into a trance。

 And I'm not saying some crazy like super hip no trance or anything like manipulative。

 But you want to get them have you。😡，Maybe watching like an infomercial like proactive skincare。

 you just don't turn it off。 You ever done that because you're kind of in like a light level trance。

 You're kind of just going with the energy， maybe a music song。

 You want to get it to where they're just in a tra。 Any of you guys here watch my videos。

 Do any of you here watching my videos and。😡，It's surprising to you how long you can watch。

 You're able to watch it longer than other people's videos。

 Is't that bizarre that I can put out a three hour video。

 And while there will be a couple complaints in the comments， its too long。

 which are the people that are never gonna spend money with me anyway。 Never， There's probably like。

 okay， let me ask a question。 this is actually actually， this is great feedback for me。

 Is there any of you in here that get annoyed when I put out long videos。

 but you still came to this event。😡，So out of the room，1，2， okay， so out of this full room and sorry。

 apologies。 But nonetheless， two people now， out of the people， by the way。

 as another quick side point， out of the people who watch my videos。

 what percent do you think get annoyed by the length。 I'd say it's a high percent。

 They're annoyed by the length。 And yet， buyers wise。The buyers want more。 Okay。

 so I'm feeding something custom for the people that spend。Let me ask you a question。

 you ever watched like a guy like say Bill O'reilly。

 do you remember he was a conservative commentator right you guys remember him and he made a lot of people very angry。

 I remember I used to watch him and I think， how does this guy be how does this guy okay with the fact that half the country hates him。

 how's he okay with that？😡，Do you ever wonder that about me because I used to wonder that about him。

 probably somebody you wonder that about me， right， how is On okay with what he does？😡。

The reason that you get O with it is because as you zone in on the people that are paying your bills。

You don't care what the other people name。 Bill O'reilly was never gonna to get a liberal to watch him anyway。

 They were never gonna to watch his program anyway。 What does he care， They're not supporting him。

 Somebody that wouldn't watch my one hourour video isn't supporting me。

 I don't care that it annoys them。 I see they probably think I make money from YouTube ads。

 The only ads that we have on our videos are for if it's for music。😡。

You think that our content for guys is gonna to get monetized on YouTube。

 you need to learn what YouTubeers so it's hilarious so people think that we don't get a dime from that。

 I don't care about their viewer their sub at all。 I care if they're gonna to become a client So I'm gonna put stuff out there for people that really want it again。

 how do I do that。's bring's bring it full circle What I'm doing is I'm coming in sharp with a certain vibe a certain energy and I'm lulling someone quickly out of their vibe into my vibe。

 This is no different than when you're meeting somebody in dating and you've got to quickly pull them in your vibe and quickly make them want more of what you have to offer they've got to want more。

 you have to have say the word energy signature， say that with me。😡，Energy signature， so a lot。

Sure is part of the challenge that you had yesterday is you've been not even cultivating an energetic signature because you're afraid。

That you might get too much attention。 So anything that would make any kind of impact。

You're hiding from it， which makes you a bit of a blank slate。

 So that's why we're gonna have to build this or zone in on the things that you're hiding。

 Okay but we will do it。 Okay， we will do it。 Oh， yes， so okay， so you get the general idea here。

 So what I'm basically doing， if you think about it is I'm speaking with conviction。

 I'm using intonation， I'm using projection， I'm using energy， I'm coming in sharpless attack。

 and I just start talking， I realize that it doesn't matter that much what I say。

 when I do my free tour videos， for example， I know it doesn't matter that much what I say。

 because for the most part， most of the people watching it are people who just like the vibe。

 and they just kind of want to get recalibrated or re sunk to that sort of general vi energy。

 How do I know this， like I said， Anthony Robins， Most of you got like I've literally been to almost all his programs。

 I've read his huge， like 500 page books or whatever they are。

 and I don't know what the six human needs are。 if after 30000 in personal pro and。😡。

And his programs were great。 if after $30000 in live events or whatever I paid。

🎼I'm also friends with a lot of his staff。 Okay， and after me reading his books。

 and I still don't know the six human needs， what does that tell you about how people really learn。

 They learn a lot of it through energy。 So it doesn't matter that much what you say Okay you've got to have great content。

 But that's just one piece of the puzzle as far as being a teacher。

 And as far as meeting people socially， the less you have your ideas cultivated， the better why。

 because it's purely about the vibe。 It is purely about energy， attraction and dating。

 particularly is preverbal。 before human beings could talk。

 how do we communicate probably through grunting， growling little random pitches in the voice and energy。

 That's why humans are evolved to feel each other's energy very much。

 The society train to condition that out of us。😡，意见领袖而言啊，内容的产量是当下最重要的一个因素啊，只要不断的输出高质量的内容。

才能在自己的领域里保持影响力。我们的粉丝呢之所以关注你，是因为喜欢你这个人，喜欢你传递的能量，而不是你讨论的一个话题，就像安东尼罗宾斯的粉丝，他们可能记不起他的一个理论。

但是却能从他们的演讲中吸取勇气和力量，就像泰勒在视频中展现的那种不羁无畏和自信，会让观众也想要打破束缚，勇敢的做自己，这种感染力是一种潜移默化的影响，不需要语言就能引起共鸣的。当然，在视频里呢也说了。

如果说你是个销售，你去展现个人的魅力的时候呢，制造这种紧迫感是非常重要的，这种紧迫感来自于你自身的一种力量。你对所做知识的一种热情投入。当你全身心的投入的时候啊，你的客户也会被你的热情打动。

比如说你在自媒体的一个创作中开头的几秒钟最为关键。这决定了观众是否愿意去。看。因此啊我们平时在放做视频的时候啊，视频的开头就能迅速的进入状态，要用饱满的情绪和洪亮的声音呢去吸引观众。

这需要的前提呢就是我们去积累能量，调动情绪，让自己处于最佳的状态。在整个沟通过程中呢，我们要不断的去推销自己的理念，争取观众的注意力。因为人的时间和精力是有限的。如果你不能快速的吸引到他们。

他们可能就会转向其他的内容，对于任何形式的社交都是这样子的。好吧，很多情况下，人们更看重的是一种情绪的体验，而不是信息的本身。在社交领域呢，语言的作用呢更加有限。

吸引力主要来自于氛围能量和语言之外的东西。这可能是因为人类啊在进化的早期啊，主要就是靠声音的音调节奏和能量来交流。而不是复杂的语言。我们天生就具有感知能量的能力，只是在社会进化的过程中啊。

逐渐的压抑了这种能力。所以说人们往往是通过能量来学习的，而不是说具体的。🎼一个内容。所以在社交互动中啊，你传递的态度、情绪状态等非语言的信息，往往比具体说了什么，更能影响对方对你的印象和感受。

比如说啊一个自信从容、积极向上的人，哪怕只是随意的聊一些家常，也能让人觉得非常的舒服，相反啊，一个充满了这种负面情绪的人，即使太尔太也很难吸引到别人。好，这就是本节课的一个内容。

下节课我们来看一看泰勒他带领学员们做实操的一部分。如何通过将自己融入语言来提升演讲和沟通的能量和影响力。
