Commanment 6Ôºå thou shalt remember to have sincere fun„ÄÇSo in this part„ÄÇ

 I'm going to be talking about the last pillar of compelling authenticity„ÄÇ

 And that is connection So why did I put this here in the section on having fun„ÄÇ

 Why would I add connection in a commandment that is all about fun„ÄÇ WellÔºå in my own progression„ÄÇ

 I actually learned how to make a connection a long time ago„ÄÇ

 I learned how to do that very thoroughly„ÄÇ But a few years agoÔºå I ran into a sticking point„ÄÇ

 And that is I would build these amazing connections with girlsÔºå We would have so much in common„ÄÇ

 we would have shared valuesÔºå we would have shared humorÔºå shared experiences„ÄÇ

 that there would be rarity to that connection„ÄÇ But what I found was that when we would have that connection in a club setting or a bar setting„ÄÇ

 It would be time for me and the girl to go homeÔºå and there just wouldn't be enough energy to the interaction for that to be possible„ÄÇ

 And what I realized is that while connection is very important and essential„ÄÇ

 you have to do it within the framework of having funÔºå Because the girls were at these clubs„ÄÇ

 there're here to have fun„ÄÇüòäÔºåIf you start having this serious conversation with them„ÄÇ

 you may build a real genuine connectionÔºå but because people are emotional creatures„ÄÇ

 they will not be excited enough to actually come home with you that night„ÄÇ

 And if you're in a city for only one night that may be the only chance to ever see this girl„ÄÇ

 So in order for these connections to me anythingÔºå they have to be resting on a framework of fun and emotions„ÄÇ

 I never want you guys to forget this„ÄÇ In factÔºå fun is so important that a lot of times fun is a strong connection in itself„ÄÇ

 I know a lot of guys that just build a connection with a girl by having fun with her that share positive emotion just naturally builds a connection„ÄÇ

 So what is connection„ÄÇ Connect is often ephemeral„ÄÇ

 We know what it feels like but it is very hard to define„ÄÇ

 People can connect with someone on different levelsÔºå you can connect with someone intellectually„ÄÇ

 you can connect with them emotionallyÔºå romanticallyÔºå ideologicallyÔºå as a business partner„ÄÇ However„ÄÇ

 the characteristics are basically the same for all types of connections„ÄÇüòä„ÄÇ

They share these core attributesÔºå number oneÔºå trustÔºå number two„ÄÇ

 rapport ability to talk with them on a variety of topicsÔºå three shared values„ÄÇ

 this can mean morals to taste to a shared cultureÔºå for shared experiences„ÄÇ

 either previous experiences or potential experiences„ÄÇ5Ôºå a two way street of positive emotionsÔºå6„ÄÇ

 the ability to confide in someone and seventhÔºå and most importantlyÔºå rarity„ÄÇ

 We only feel connections with someone„ÄÇ If you feel that you have a rare compatibility in the above characteristics„ÄÇ

Some connections have all of these attributesÔºå Some have a few of these attributes„ÄÇ

 but all connections have some of these attributes„ÄÇ So in this section„ÄÇ

 we're going to talk about how to build a connection with those characteristics in mind„ÄÇ

 and we're going to talk about how to build a connection with anyoneÔºå but specifically„ÄÇ

 we're going to go deep into how to build a romantic connection with a woman„ÄÇ

 So there are two things that are necessary before a connection can be built„ÄÇ

 And this is true of all connectionÔºå not just romantic connection„ÄÇ First is value„ÄÇ

 And in the setting of a romantic connection attraction„ÄÇ

 You've covered how to get attraction in detail earlier„ÄÇ but this is very important„ÄÇ

 People only want to build a connection with someone with value„ÄÇ

 You don't want to build a connection with the bum that sleeps in the dumpster outside your apartment building„ÄÇ

 Some people might deny thisÔºå but you will see that in general„ÄÇ

 we desire a connection with people that we are attracted to already that we think are of value already or that„ÄÇ

Think are of status already„ÄÇ This is why you will get girls that feel they have a connection with a celebrity or with a musician is because they are so attracted to them that it creates a halo effect where they are attaching positive attributes to a person they don't know and then feeling that they have something in common with that person„ÄÇ

The second thing you need before building a connection is qualifying„ÄÇ

 Remember that you and me part of the structureÔºå you versus meÔºå you and me„ÄÇ

 us together that you and me part through you assess if the girl has the same values as you do„ÄÇ

 and she is now trying to impress you she is showing you her attributes so that you can then accept them and show that you have standards„ÄÇ

 is very importantÔºå trying to build a connection without qualifying comes off as insincere„ÄÇ

 trying to manipulate them or desperate„ÄÇ You have no standards and would do this with anything„ÄÇ

 Think of maybe someone trying to come talk to you at a supermarketÔºå and they just seem really„ÄÇ

 really overea„ÄÇ They really want to connection with you because they just want to connect with anyone„ÄÇ

 It's kind of offputÔºå because you know that this person would do this with anyone„ÄÇ

 They therefore have no standards and that the connection„ÄÇ

 even if you had one with them would mean absolutely nothing„ÄÇ There's no rarity to it„ÄÇ

 We've talked a lot about honest signals„ÄÇ And what that means in this context„ÄÇNumber one„ÄÇ

 you shouldn't want to build a connection with someone who sucks and who doesn't share your values„ÄÇ

 You have to see if this person really shares your values before you use this stuff„ÄÇ Number two„ÄÇ

 I want you to not think of these things as tactics„ÄÇ

 But as an understanding of how a connection works and how to do things early that you would usually naturally do later„ÄÇ

 So we are simply taking things that you might do later when you get to know someone and kind of speeding up the process„ÄÇ

 or if you're a needy guy we' taking things that you do all the time and then putting it after you actually know this girl's values„ÄÇ

 But either wayÔºå focus on using these things as honest signals and not contrived tactics„ÄÇ

 So let's talk about the things you can do to actually build a connection with someone„ÄÇ Number one„ÄÇ

 eye contact„ÄÇ There's a reason I put this first„ÄÇ A lot of times„ÄÇ

 a connection can be built on this alone„ÄÇ and is very rare to make a strong connection with someone without a lot of eye contact„ÄÇ

 It is impossible to make a connection with someone„ÄÇWithout some eye contact„ÄÇ

 this is one of those very human qualities„ÄÇ It is a primal way that people connect„ÄÇ

 You should also know that this is more important than anything you say„ÄÇ

 I have a very verbal style of talking to people in a very verbal style of talking to women„ÄÇ

 And a lot of timesÔºå I would want to hear what they would say„ÄÇ

 So when they were talking to me in a loud club„ÄÇ I would turn my head and just listen„ÄÇ

 because I thought that the content of what I was saying was more important than looking her in the eye„ÄÇ

 I then realized that this was completely shutting down any connection that we'd had„ÄÇ

 And if I just looked her in the eyeÔºå it was more important than catching every word and thinking of a logical response to what she was saying„ÄÇ

 So focus on this„ÄÇ Remember what we talked aboutÔºå steady and relaxed eye contact as if you were just staring at a wall„ÄÇ

Number twoÔºå oversharing„ÄÇHave you ever met someone that was so open about their life that you felt like you've known them forever in a very short amount of time„ÄÇ

 This is something certain people do naturally„ÄÇ and they end up having a lot of close friends„ÄÇ

 a lot of romantic experiences and a lot of people that feel like they know the real them„ÄÇ

 So what does this mean„ÄÇ It means talking about different areas of your life so much that it creates a sort of tapestry of who you are„ÄÇ

 So this means sharing opinions that you haveÔºå sharing valuesÔºå sharing tastesÔºå experiences„ÄÇ

 what you ate for dinnerÔºå what you are wearing yesterday„ÄÇ

 The key to this is to be sharing and peppering in things into your interactions where there is no other reason to share them„ÄÇ

 except for you just wanted to say it„ÄÇ So most people will hear thisÔºå They'll sayÔºå oh„ÄÇ

 overshar and they'll sayÔºå ohÔºå yeahÔºå man„ÄÇ I once went skydiving when I was in Hawaii„ÄÇ

But that is the type of oversharing that has a ulterior motive and it's very see through„ÄÇ

 What we're talking about is throwing these little things in opinionsÔºå valuesÔºå taste„ÄÇ

 upbringing experiencesÔºå random stuff from your life„ÄÇ

 throwing it in and throwing a lot of it in and making sure that the things you are saying you're just saying as pure expression„ÄÇ

 They're just little parts of your life„ÄÇ that you just happen to be that type of person who shares all of this because that's just how you talk„ÄÇ

 I have had situations with girls where I will do this I'll either be on a date or be meeting them in a club environment„ÄÇ

 I will overshare just everything about my lifeÔºå little random detailsÔºå things from my childhood„ÄÇ

 books I read some news articleÔºå What I would do in a random situation„ÄÇ

 What I think about this random thing that's happening in the world„ÄÇ

 And because there's no ulterior motive for me to be sharing this much of my opinions and this much of who I am because these are just like little tidbits from my life„ÄÇ

 and because I'm just kind of throwing them into the interaction„ÄÇ it creates this effect„ÄÇ

Where girls will actually say to me" I feel like I could tell you anything Now why is the girl saying I feel like I could tell you anything when I'm doing the majority of the talking and I'm the one telling her everything because of that concept what you feel they feel also very important and fun„ÄÇ

 but if you are sharing everything with herÔºå it gives her the permission to do the same and even if she's not sharing everything with you„ÄÇ

 she'll feel as if she is or as if she could„ÄÇSo make this a habit„ÄÇ

 Do this in your day to day conversations„ÄÇ You will find that people just naturally feel like they know you extremely well„ÄÇ

 Number 3Ôºå commonalities„ÄÇ This is how most people connect„ÄÇ I want to make a point„ÄÇ

 There's only works„ÄÇ If she knows that you are not trying to make everything she says a commonality„ÄÇ

 There's nothing more annoying„ÄÇ then you sayingÔºå ohÔºå I like this band„ÄÇ And someone's likeÔºå oh„ÄÇ

 me too„ÄÇ you knowÔºå ohÔºå I like this food„ÄÇ OhÔºå me too„ÄÇ Like they're just trying too hard„ÄÇ

 It comes off as extremely needy„ÄÇ So how do you do this„ÄÇ Well let's say you're talking about books„ÄÇ

 She saysÔºå ohÔºå I really like this book„ÄÇ WellÔºå if you haven't read it„ÄÇ

 the most natural thing to do instead of trying to make a commonality where there isn't one is to say„ÄÇ

 ohÔºå I haven't read that one„ÄÇ You guys will naturally keep talking about book„ÄÇ

 She mentions another book„ÄÇ You goÔºå oh yeahÔºå I haven't read that one or yeahÔºå I't„ÄÇ

'm not that into that1„ÄÇ I read itÔºå but I just didn't like that much„ÄÇ

 And then she mentions another book„ÄÇ And you sayÔºå oh my GodÔºå I've read that book„ÄÇ I love that book„ÄÇ

 So you see that she knows that this is genuine„ÄÇüòäÔºåThis commonality is now genuine because you are able to demonstrate that this is your real opinion and that this is a real commonality and it doesn't have to be books„ÄÇ

 You can do this with anything„ÄÇ ReallyÔºå the habit here is not pretending to have commonalities when you don't„ÄÇ

 And then when you run into a natural commonalityÔºå accenting that talking about that in death„ÄÇ

 everyone has some sort of commonalityÔºå it will come up eventuallyÔºå Next„ÄÇ

 ability to speak articulately on something they know about or care about„ÄÇ So what does that mean„ÄÇ

 WellÔºå let's say that you run into that commonality„ÄÇ If you know a lot about that book„ÄÇ

 then talking about that bookÔºå your thoughts on the book and being able to say that in a smart or clear or insightful way will show understanding of her world and the things that she cares about„ÄÇ

 I do this a lotÔºå when I naturally run into something that we have in common„ÄÇ

 I use that ranting ability that I have where I will share my thoughts on that part of her life„ÄÇ

 And because I'm doing that specifically on the thing that I know a lot about„ÄÇ

It creates a effect where she knows that I understand her and her worldview„ÄÇ A little caveat to this„ÄÇ

 This cannot come off as pretentious or presumptuous as if you just know everything about her or you know more than her„ÄÇ

 That's a big turn off„ÄÇ All it should say is that you have your own thoughts on this subject„ÄÇ

 And those thoughts should be clear enough to show that they actually reflect a real comprehension„ÄÇ

 NextÔºå ability to provide insight into their life by either telling them something about themselves that they know and you don't or telling them something about themselves that they don't know„ÄÇ

 know this used to be called coldreads„ÄÇ that was the old way of doing this where you would come up with some bullshit thing about this girl„ÄÇ

 where youÔºå I've noticed that you once had a really terrible experience surrounding water„ÄÇ

 That's a commonÔºå you know old cold readedÔºå because know something like 70% of people have had some terrible experience in the ocean or something related to drowning„ÄÇ

 That's one of those things that is very commonÔºå but people wouldn't guess is common„ÄÇ

 And so you can pretend like„ÄÇYou know about their life„ÄÇ

 So I'm not saying to use these stock cder readsÔºå but rather to use a more honest signal version of these coldder reads and what that mean actually thinking about„ÄÇ

 okayÔºå what type of person is thisÔºüWhat type of things could I say to demonstrate that I understand it's something about her that she didn't tell me or something about her that she doesn't know herself„ÄÇ

 And with the part where she doesn't know herselfÔºå remember that they shouldn't come off as pretentious or presumptuous„ÄÇ

So there's certain girls that I can tell they're just sort of nerdy in high school„ÄÇ

 And so I will talk to them about itÔºå not in a way that's making fun of her„ÄÇ

 but I will say something likeÔºå you knowÔºå I can tell that you were kind of introverted in high school and that you didn't really come into your own until later in life„ÄÇ

 that's just something that I can tell about people„ÄÇ And she will sayÔºå oh my GodÔºå that's so true„ÄÇ

 And it is true„ÄÇ So start finding those things that you can tell about people that provides that insight into their life„ÄÇ

These work much better if they're positive„ÄÇ You knowÔºå so I'm not going to sayÔºå ohÔºå you were a nerd„ÄÇ

 you're a loser„ÄÇ I'm going to sayÔºå ohÔºå you kind of came into your own in the last couple years and then saying something that provides insight into something she doesn't know about yourself„ÄÇ

 You can sayÔºå nowÔºå a lot of those people that were naturally social early in life„ÄÇ

 They keep that socialnessÔºå but they never really understand social dynamics„ÄÇ

 And what I can tell about you is that you're going to keep building that social understanding over time because it didn't come naturally to you„ÄÇ

 Next one„ÄÇListening and empathizing with someone„ÄÇ This cannot be fake„ÄÇ

 You know how you fucking use the tactic of listening to someone„ÄÇ You actually listen to them„ÄÇ

 You know how you use the tactic of empathizing with someone„ÄÇ

 You actually put yourself in their shoes„ÄÇ You try and imagine what they are thinking and what they are feeling„ÄÇ

 HoweverÔºå this is very powerful and it has to be done at some point„ÄÇ

 Don't use this as an excuse to not leave the conversation„ÄÇ A lot of guys„ÄÇ

 they think they're getting in reallyÔºå really good because they just listen to the girl's problems„ÄÇ

 and they listen to her talk about her ex boyfriend and one asshole was for hours and hours and hours„ÄÇ

 and then they're surprised when that girl has no interest in going home with them„ÄÇ Well„ÄÇ

 the guy didn't express any of his personality„ÄÇ This has to be done in pockets where you are just demonstrating that you actually have an interest in her and that you can actually empathize with her life situation„ÄÇ

 remember doing it in pockets„ÄÇNext„ÄÇMetta statements and narrating what's happening„ÄÇ

 So what does that meanÔºå It means commenting on what is happening from a third person perspective„ÄÇ

 You can do this on what you're doing or feeling or thinking„ÄÇ

 on what she's doing or thinking or feeling„ÄÇOr on what is happening in the interaction in general„ÄÇ

 the key to this is to talk about what is ideally happening„ÄÇ What is a good example of this„ÄÇ Well„ÄÇ

 I might say somethingÔºå you knowÔºå I came here to just have fun and fuck around„ÄÇ

 But now I'm actually meeting someone who I find interesting„ÄÇ And that's kind of rare for me„ÄÇ

 I'm commenting on what is happening with me„ÄÇ or I might say something to her that's similar„ÄÇ

 Like I can tell that you don't meet someone that you connect with very often and that it's rare for you to be in this experience„ÄÇ

 So that's what is ideally happeningÔºå rightÔºå She's connecting with you„ÄÇ

 but by making those statementsÔºå it eases the process of actually getting to that place where you guys are connected„ÄÇ

 nextÔºå talking in emotional content and creating emotional spikes„ÄÇ

 So what I mean by emotional content„ÄÇ this can take many different forms number one language„ÄÇ

 saying I feel rather than I think or adding emotional language to the things that you're saying describing emotional situations in your life and actually feeling the emotions in real time„ÄÇ

 Remember what„ÄÇYou feel she feels and girls love those kind of emotional roller coasters cycling through different emotional experiences that you experience together„ÄÇ

 This means you go and play Roulettes and you have a lot of fun then you talk for five minutes about this time you were depressed when you're a kid and then you go dance and there's a lot of heightened sexual tension„ÄÇ

 you're taking her through those different emotional experiences„ÄÇAnd lastlyÔºå emotional spikes„ÄÇ

 These areÔºå you knowÔºå takeawaysÔºå talking in nonpolitically correct speech„ÄÇ

 anything that temporarily spikes her emotions positively or negatively so that she's getting that compelling experience„ÄÇ

 NextÔºå creating an us reality instead of a you and me realityÔºå What are we like„ÄÇ

 What do we believe What would we do in this situation„ÄÇ

 as opposed to what would I do in this situation„ÄÇ this could be commenting on outsiders„ÄÇ

 talking about other people in the club and what you think they're like talking about what type of couple you would be„ÄÇ

 People kind of do this naturally in an unhealthy way when they're around their other friends and they are like talking shit on the other people in their friend group„ÄÇ

 rightÔºå They are creating a reality where they are the conspirators and they are commenting on the outsiders„ÄÇ

 the other friends that they have And the truth is„ÄÇ

 a lot of people build a connection through talking shit about other people„ÄÇNext„ÄÇ

 there used to be this old concept called future adventure projections„ÄÇ

 The concept was that you were talking about some sort of adventure or some sort of shared experience that you guys would have in the future„ÄÇ

 And it creates this sort of us reality as opposed to a you and me reality„ÄÇ

 And these are powerful But the old way of doing this was kind of tacky„ÄÇ It was kind of a joke„ÄÇ

 So when I'm talking to a girlÔºå I will naturally talk about the future experiences that we might have or that we could have if this continues„ÄÇ

 And this isn't like me selling her or anything like that„ÄÇ It's not me coming off as needy„ÄÇ

 just a little thing to add into the natural flow of the conversation„ÄÇ So I might sayÔºå like„ÄÇ

 when me and my college roommate first met„ÄÇ We got along veryÔºå very well„ÄÇ I think we were at a party„ÄÇ

 And he said something likeÔºå ohÔºå yeahÔºå you knowÔºå my familys like this and this and this„ÄÇ ButÔºå you„ÄÇ

 you'll meet them eventually you're part of the crew„ÄÇ

 And that made me feel a lot more comfortable around him„ÄÇ

 because he had added in that we might have this shared experience„ÄÇ

 And because it came off as natural and non-ney„ÄÇ So with a girlÔºå I might say something likeÔºå yeah„ÄÇüòä„ÄÇ

There is this amazing lookout a couple miles away on this mountain and you can see all of the lights in the city„ÄÇ

 you can see all of the stars and I'm going to take you there it'll be great„ÄÇ

 itll be awesome it's only 15 minutes away and then you change topics„ÄÇ

 don't keep trying to talk about that or also it will come off as you're like selling something„ÄÇNext„ÄÇ

 logically communicating to the girl why she's special and unique in intense detail„ÄÇ

 This gives logical reasons for her to justify the attraction that she's feeling„ÄÇ

 So we talked about girls that will get crushes on celebrities„ÄÇ

 and they will attach these arbitrary commonalities that they and the celebrity have„ÄÇ

 because she is trying to justify shes trying to logically justify the intense attraction that she has for that guy„ÄÇ

 So if you can give her those detailsÔºå why you actually like her„ÄÇ

 how she lives up to your standards and how she is an archetype of your ideal girl„ÄÇ

 She will be able to have those reasons for why there's a shared attraction and why there's a shared connection„ÄÇ

 It makes the connection much more valid„ÄÇ It also communicates that you have standards and that she passed those standards„ÄÇ

Narrative timelinesÔºå basically talking about what's happened so far and then extrapolating out in time about what happened„ÄÇ

 being likeÔºå you knowÔºå when we metÔºå we we actually didn't like each other that much„ÄÇ

 but the more we get to know each other„ÄÇ we seem to actually have a lot in common and we're gonna have one of those tumultuous relationships where we're both very strong personalities„ÄÇ

 but we both love it„ÄÇ we get into fightsÔºå but we both love the fact that it's so passionate„ÄÇ

 you're saying what did happenÔºå what is happening and what's going to happen„ÄÇ Next„ÄÇ

 being comfortable with silence„ÄÇ This is something you do naturally with people that you already have a connection with„ÄÇ

 So with your friendsÔºå you might have a 40 minute car ride where neither of you says anything„ÄÇ

 But that's part of the connection„ÄÇ because you feel so comfortable around that person„ÄÇ

 you are okay with that silence„ÄÇ You don't have to fill that silence with forced conversation„ÄÇ Now„ÄÇ

 this must be a deliberate silence and is better if you're looking her in the eye„ÄÇ SoÔºå you know„ÄÇ

 if you're arm in arm with a girl or you are facing the girl and you already have like a pretty good connection„ÄÇ

A lot of timesÔºå I'll just add in these pregnant pauses where I'm just kind of looking at her„ÄÇ

 ObviouslyÔºå your eye contact has to be on point on this and stammering for something to say during an awkward part doesn't count„ÄÇ

 Just have those pregnant pauses where you're both just sort of looking at each other and neither of you feels the need to say anything„ÄÇ

 And then afterwardsÔºå sometimes I'll narrate the silence„ÄÇ I'll be like„ÄÇ

 you know you feel comfortable with someone when you're just able to look them in the eye for a period of time„ÄÇ

 Last communicating what type of relationship you guys would have can do this both as a joke or do this as an actual statement„ÄÇ

 So you knowÔºå the joke would beÔºå we would get married And then we'd have a bunch of kids and get divorced and each of us would be fighting over who gets the kids not because we wanted them„ÄÇ

 but because we want to be other person to take the kids because we don't want to deal with them„ÄÇ

 that's a little jokeyÔºå but it kind of adds that romantic connotation into the conversation„ÄÇ

 You can also do this as a real thing„ÄÇ LikeÔºå you know„ÄÇ

 I'll be we would have the type of situation where we would both have very strong personalities and other people wouldn't„ÄÇ

Understand how we can deal with each other„ÄÇ But we would understandÔºå because it would be real„ÄÇ

 So look back at this stuffÔºå use it and realize that the more real these things are„ÄÇ

 the better they are„ÄÇ RememberÔºå honest signals„ÄÇ stuff we just talked about should be done mostly in pockets between fun or in some cases where it's easy woven into the fun„ÄÇ

 These pockets of connection time can get bigger and bigger as time goes on„ÄÇ

 Remember that there still needs to be an air of nonneediness„ÄÇ

 and an implicit knowledge that you could still walk away as in she doesn't already have you„ÄÇ

 She doesn't already have all the validation„ÄÇ It takes a lot of social and emotional intelligence to use this stuff effectively„ÄÇ

 It's gonna take some time to figure out exactly where each piece goes in your own personal style„ÄÇ

 and you're going to need to develop that emotional and social intelligence for this to work optimally So don't be surprised if it ends up coming off clunky at first„ÄÇ

 A few last things on this„ÄÇ only use what's necessary for what type of interaction you're in„ÄÇ

New Year's in Vegas and everyone's partying less of this stuff is necessary and you just need to focus on having fun„ÄÇ

 If you're atÔºå let's sayÔºå a charity event or some other serious event and you meet a girl„ÄÇ Well„ÄÇ

 more of this stuff might be better„ÄÇ LastlyÔºå realize that if you build a super intenseense connection with someone„ÄÇ

 sleep with them and then bounce„ÄÇ It could result in some very hurt feelings and bad results„ÄÇ

 Don't be that guy„ÄÇ Be honest in your intentions the entire time„ÄÇ

 Don't give girls false expectations that you never intended to live up to„ÄÇ

 I really can't stress this enough„ÄÇüòäÔºåExerciseÔºå start practicing one of these principles in your day to day conversations„ÄÇ
