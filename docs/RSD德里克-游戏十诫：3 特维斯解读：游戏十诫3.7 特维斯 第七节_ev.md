# RSD德里克-游戏十诫：3 特维斯解读：游戏十诫3.7 特维斯 第七节_ev

Commandment 7， thou shalt invite her to join your adventure。

If you have been following the previous commandments so far， this next commandment is quite simple。

 But before I continue， I'd like to make a couple of important notes。

The 10 Commandments of game exist as a holy trifecta with Drerick's boot campamp and brotherhood。

If you knew what to do， how to do it and had an accountability system to go get there。

 then there is no reality where you don't achieve success in this area at the end of one year of doing this。

If you haven't already， get on three boot camps， Derek， just like I did， just like Sean did。

 just like everyone else in the client case studies have done。 It has simply changed my life。Also。

 get under Brotherhood to find other Derek bootot campamp alumni to go out with。

These are your teammates that are going to make sure you stay accountable to your success with women。

 I can only show you the door， but it is you who has to walk through it。

The 10 Commandment is about taking action。 If you haven't been implementing some of the practices。

 don't be surprised when you go out and attempt to try everything all at once that you get stuck in your head。

There is a lot to remember， so each practice has to be habitualized into your behavior one step at a time。

Secondly， continue writing field reports the way I described in commandment for it。

For as many interactions as you'd like or that you can remember。First， write down what happened。

 Second， write down to what you were doing that was going well。 Third。

 write down the moment that you lost the interaction。And fourth。

 write down what you will do next time in that same interaction to keep it going。

You don't have to do much more than this。 When you write down what you will do next time。

 you are simply giving your brain the automatic thing to do in the situations when they occur。

Thirdly， when you are speaking quite bluntly very honestly and with some dark humorour。

 some women might see you as socially uncalibrated instead of a true high value male。

Very attractive women have the unique task of deciding if you are either a high value man who feels like he is supposed to talk to her or an insane person who doesn't have any social inhibitions。

All the guys in the middle are thinking that they don't deserve that woman。

 or they are still working up the courage。So basically。

 an attractive woman will typically see only a high value man like yourself。

 and she'll see the criminal， the insane， the perverted and the homeless。

 and then not much else after that。A useful strategy to mull over some of the brash things that you are saying is by calling out the blunt honesty of the situation。

This will suffice in indicating to her that you are not the criminal， not the insane。

 not the perverted， nor are the homeless， because you have demonstrated some social tact and funny enough。

 this alone oftentimes will get very pretty girls very， very attracted。For example。

 you might call out that you're not used to doing this type of thing if you're still getting the ha of some of the new behaviors you're trying out。

Or that you're not used to being in this particular environment。

 especially if you don't go to that club very often。It must be true， mind you。

 Don't make something up。 A little bit of vulnerability and social tact goes a long the way。Finally。

 I realized that for a lot of you using the default opener， your pretty girl。

 I had to come say hi might become saturated， meaning everyone is using it。

This can be easily replaced with。 Hey， how's it going， I'm Travis or some variety of the sort。

Every opener has some element of getting her attention， conveying that you are interested in her。

 offering some value， like in this case， your name and then inviting her to join the interaction。Now。

 let's get back to it。 Thou shalt invite her to join your adventure。

Derek has always said that it is important to remember that the game is something that you do together。

It is not something that you do to a girl。 It is something that you do with her。

This is another one of those differences of being a great man versus being a great manipulator。

That's why the commandment is thou shalt invite her to join your adventure。Additionally。

 Derek has commented that all we are doing in this game and all we are teaching is what comes naturally。

 but speeding it up and making it more efficient。We have spent years understanding the details of our own psychology and the underpinnings of social dynamics。

 specifically to get massive success in the areas of women and money。In fact。

 every man and woman is doing exactly what we are teaching。

 but just in a much more slowed down process。You can probably see the romantic narrative yourself。

Introduction may many days or many weeks of getting to know each other。

He works up the courage to ask her on a date to which she says yes or no。 If she said no。

 then the man spends days feeling guilty or embarrassed。 If she says yes。

 they'll typically have a pleasant time getting to know each other。 The man will try to kiss her。

 and she'll say no， not to night or give him the cheek。Weeks later。

 they go on another date after having long texting conversations。

He invites her out to a different place。 They meet each other's friends。

They share increasingly personal information about each other。 A connection is building。

 They begin holding hands。By this point， they've certainly had some conflict。

 some argument or disagreement about some standpoint。 They're learning new things about each other。

 but they still like each other。Weeks later， third date。

 he really turns it up a notch and takes her out for a romantic evening for a nice dinner that gets the horrible idea of taking her out to a nightclub。

😊，Meanwhile， she's already thought about it and has decided she's going to have sex with him tonight。

Then， I show up。Hey， you're pretty girl。 I had to come say hi。 I'm Travis。 What's your name。

Then insert some offensive joke。 Then insert talking about my passions。

 Then insert how she looks like one of the spice girls when they were still hot。

We're both joking and laughing hysterically。 She introduces me to this guy。 I give him a high 5。

 subdued cool polo， nice salmon color。 I turned back to the girl。 Hey， I'm buying you a drink。

 Come with me two seconds。😊，I take her hand， and she walks with The guy hopelessly follows。

 I lightly poke fun at her， then compliment her sincerely about what I like and don't like about her。

 I'm offering her suggestions。I very slowly motioned the kiss here。

 but she gives me the cheek and laughs at me for trying。 I admit that she is right。 Unfazed。

 I introduced her to Dererick， saying that he's my hero and my saviour。😊。

What ensues next is a hilarious emotional roller coaster between the three of us。

 including a very heated argument with her on the peer groups of special education teachers and the pros and cons of women's suffrage。

😊，We get back to a fun topic。 laugh some more。 He gives me an endorsement and explicitly encourages her to go have sex with me。

 to which she is shocked， but slightly charmed by。I say。

 come over here and start pulling her to move。 She asked why I say there's a midget running round and taking everyone's phones。

 I heard he's on the patio。 Come with。She's unsure。

 but she's going with mostly because I'm just taking her by the hand and she's intrigued。

She says she's on a date right now。 I laugh and say， no worries。 We'll be right back。

 Then we go dancing。 Then we start making out。One song later， I say， let's go and we're leaving。

The guy she came with， hopeless。Everything that guy has accomplished in several weeks or maybe even several months。

 I have accomplished is only 45 minutes from open to close。

This commandment is about inviting the girl to the roller coaster of your adventure。

 from open to close。😊，Ideally， at this point， you've gotten really good at just trusting your own instinct to start saying words when you first talk to a woman。

 And after implementing the practices in Commandment 6。

 you've gone from having consistent conversations to having rather emotional conversations。

Understandably， you're going to be getting some rather intense emotional reactions from other women。

 both positive and negative。 since you are getting emotional by raising the fun for both of you。

We talked before in commandment too how the game is simply the right man finding the right woman。

You answered the questions。 what kind of life you want to live and who's the ideal companion for that life。

This commandment is literally auditioning her to play the role of the ideal companion for that life。

 Does she fit that mold， How well does she play along for the life that you want to live。

Do your friends like her。Do you like what she does， Do you like what she laughs about。

 How do you have fun together。How does she contrast against your boundaries。

 Is she into the same sexual things as you， Your beliefs。

 Does she argue with you the way that you would want someone one to argue with you。

 Does she have similar goals， Can you fit her into a longer term lifestyle and so on and so forth。

I want to talk about what you can do so that you can facilitate this process in 45 minutes instead of several weeks or months。

First off， a note should be made about body language。

 We've already discussed eye contact and vocal projection in previous commandments。

 Let's now talk about body language and physicality。

When you first go and talk to a woman you're interested in， you should be exactly 32。

6 cm away from her or 12。83 inches。 Got it。 Make sure you bring a ro to measure when you go talk to her。

If you think this is ridiculous， it is。 don't do this。 Instead， simply do this。

 Put your arms straight down to your side and hold your elbows to the side of your body。😡。

Holding your elbows to your side。 bend at your elbows to point your finger tips straight out in front of you。

 in this position， walk towards a nearby wall。You should be roughly as far from the girl as you are from the wall right now。

 You can put your arms down， by the way。If you are any further away than this distance。

 it is no longer a man to woman interaction。You should note that if you choose to talk to a man from this close distance。

 you might get punched in the mouth because you're probably trying to start a fight with him。

When you are this far away from a woman， it not only lets her know that you like her。

 but it actually makes her more comfortable than if you were further apart。

When you let a woman know that you are interested in her sexually and is open minded about what she sees about you。

 you'll notice that all of a sudden， she becomes more engaged in the interaction because she's thinking about sex。

 too。 That is， if you're the right guy。It triggers a very automatic and emotional wiring to become more sexually receptive。

 I'll talk about sexually aggressive versus sexually receptive， in commandment 8。

When you are this close to her， make every effort to establish physical contact as early as possible。

 The more you wait on this， the more weird it will be as she has already slotted you into the nice guy category by that point。

Do a handshake， a high5。 Squeeze the shoulder firmly， anything。Under all circumstances。

 avoid the hand of doom。 The hand of doom is a completely an utterly useless tactic。

 and the most honest signal that you are a slimy worm that probably just crawled out of your dog's asshole。

This move is where the first time you touch a girl is exactly when you touch a girl on her lower back while talking to her。

Ask any girl， and they know exactly what this is， and they hate it。Instead of this。

 make every effort to stand at the prescribed distance I just mentioned just a moment ago。

 If you can stand that close to her， it will be very easy to establish physical contact。

Simply grab the arm， touch his shoulder， arm the shoulder， et cetera， et cetera。

Don't forget to hold relaxed eye contact while doing this。As it turns out in practice。

 women love physical contact as delivered by a masculine guy。

 They reward this behavior with lots of attraction and lots of giggling。Contrary to popular belief。

 women love to be touched not by any man， but by a confident bold guy。

 not afraid to take risks and just go for it。We'll talk more about this in Commandment 8。

It will be important that you establish physical contact early on because it exposes her to being touched by you so that when you take her hand to go move her。

 she isn't freaked out by it。Now， let's talk about the adventure youre going to invite her on。

As the most in demand live dating coach in the world right now。

 Drek is a subject matter expert in this field。The natural progression of someone who gains high levels of expertise in the field is that they start with zero knowledge。

 Then they have a ton of knowledge。 Then they boil that knowledge down to the fundamental pieces that work。

 which is why it's the 10 commandments of game instead of the 15 or the 20 commandments of game。

Derek has also boiled down the mating ritual to the fundamental pieces that work best not only for you guys。

 but have worked for men for not hundreds or thousands， but hundreds of thousands of years。

The fundamental mating ritual is as follows。 A man will see a woman talk to her。

 then go meet her tribe。Then the man will bring that woman to go meet his tribe。

Then they have the tribal drink and do the tribal dance。And then sex is the natural result。

Ask Derek about the foundations of the matideing ritual， and he can explain it best in person。

This fundamental mating ritual is no different today day， nor is it any different in the nightclub。

Basically， what you saw in the story that I opened this commandment with is the Travis experience。

It is my anthem。 No woman shall be denied the Travis experience。

I have built a thesis for myself that it is an enormous shame that any woman who is horny and dresses up to go out to a nightclub goes home unfucked。

😡，This is a tremendous sin and a crime to humanity。Therefore， for every attractive girl I see。

 I have resolved to run her through the Travis experience。😊。

What is the Travis experience you might ask。When a woman goes out， especially to a night clubub。

 she gets the opportunity to experience a lot of different men。 They， too。

 have their own versions of their own experience。They're basically like rides at an amusement park。

Some rides， some women like other rides。 they don't like so much。

 Some of them they in the mood for on one day and maybe not so much in the mood for another day。

I once read an essay by Cyrro Northcote Parkinson， an old historian famous for coining the adage Parkinson's law。

 That being that work expands to fill the time in which it is allotted for its completion。

In this particular essay， he was discussing screening mechanisms for how hiring managers at corporate companies choose his applicants for a new job。

 including looking to see their competency for that job if they knew anyone at the company or other arbitrary factors。

However， this is too time consuming of a screening and selection process。

Parkinson devised a screening strategy where one would simply have to describe the job listing in such a way that only one person would apply for it。

 and they could simply hire that applicant skipping the interview process completely。As a result。

 the way that they describe the job listing is brutally honest。

 sugarcoats nothing of what will be involved and sufficiently discourages the wrong applicant to apply。

I apply the same process to the adventure I take in a nightclub。

I do not have the time nor energy to completely screen the woman I end up meeting in that night club。

 So instead， I take her on an adventure that is 1000 per cent the type of adventure only I would enjoy。

 And if it is not for her， I let her opt out of it。Similar to this job listening I just described。

 I am brutally honest about doing what I actually enjoy。 I sugarcoat nothing。

 and I sufficiently discouraged a wrong woman from spending any additional time with me。

If I am living the life I want to live， I will fit with the ideal companion for that life。

 quite naturally。The adventure and the life I'm living is the one that would make me most satisfied。

 And that's the Travis experience。😊，The rules of the Travis experience are simple。

 The moment you want to leave the ride， you can stop and leave。 The ride is simply not for you。

 If you like the ride or if you don't do anything about leaving the ride。

 then buckle up because it's going to be a wild ride。The Travis experience doesn't change。

 Any one who hops on board will get the same ride。 The Travis experience changes for no one。

 except for Travis。Deerrerick has often talked about his style game being more about effective marketing。

 essentially revealing the value instead of convincing and persuading。

The Drerick experience changes for no one。 Everyone gets the same dererick experience。😊。

Everyone is qualified to have the Drek experience， but the Drek experience is not for everyone。

The Travis experience starts at the open。She's going to quickly get a taste of how my mind works since I am trusting myself and speaking exactly the words in the top of my head with my intention being on self amusement and dark humor。

Just because I have the intention for it doesn't mean that she'll get it。

 but I do have the intention for bringing it out early。She's going to see how I am physical with her。

She is going to see how I am calibrating to her responses to my advances。

She's going to hear about my own personal beliefs。 She's going to hear me asking about all of her logistics and about her life。

 But mostly， I'm going to be talking about myself and what I like and pumping my own personal stay。

 because I really care more about speaking honestly than I do about making the interaction work。

If she hasn't left the Travis experience yet， if she hasn't left this ride yet。

 then she is going on to phase 2， the movement。The next muscle I'm going to have you build is moving the girl to a new location。

I see you guys on boot camping。 Most of your default plans is to talk to the girl in one spot forever。

If you don't make the first movement， then she will likely move you to a new location。Now。

 it's no longer your personal experience that she is writing right now。

 You are joining her experience。 And now you are no longer in charge。I noticed that on occasion。

 when I was still learning this， If I followed the girls and took their lead instead of taking the lead myself。

 they oftentimes took me to a gay bar。I asked other boot camp assistants about this。

 and they all said the same thing happened to them as well。The other assistant， Tony。

 who you will hear in one of the client success case studies。

 joke that they do that because they instinctively feel you must be gay since you aren't taking the lead yourself。

So unless you've turned gay at this point， you'll have to start taking the lead for yourself。

If you're not going to have sex with the girl at the spot， you met her。

 which I highly recommend against for obvious reasons。

And if following her lead leads you to a gay bar。Then you will have to lead her to somewhere other than where you just first met her。

You might think， oh， I'll just take her home immediately， right。While this is logistically possible。

 it is not best practice。Girls tend to go home with men that they feel like they know， not strangers。

At this point， you are just strangers。 And at best。

 you are two strangers that are sharing an emotional moment。Plus。

 the Travis experience is a ride with whips and turns， Ups and downs， highs and lows。

 not just a single drop。😊，She doesn't get to go home with me， just yet。

You will have to lead her to somewhere else from where you are currently standing to where you expect to take her at the end of the night。

If you did your homework from Commandment 4， thou shalt discern the logistics and social dynamics of the interaction。

 Then you have a game plan of where to take her and a plan B and a plan C， if those don't work out。

Now， where do you take her next， Well， that is a part of the Travis experience。

You are going to have your own experience named after you as well。

 and it will be an experience that will be unique to you and you alone。

There are many experiences like this one， but this one is mine。You will have your version as well。

 Where do you take her next， anywhere you want。If you are not to violate the commandment about remembering to have sincere fun。

 then you will be bringing her to the next spot in your adventure to continue pumping your own state。

Let me make a slight detour here and talk about general dating and relate it back to where you are going to take her next in the nightclub。

If you are going to meet up with a girl for a date， what do you do。For many guys。

 the first thing they might do is look up fun and cheap ideas for a date。Dinner in a movie。

 coffee and bagels， sushi trampolinenes and chocolate， mini golf， lobster dinner， bedroom acrobatics。

I cannot begin to outline how many commandments you are violating when you decide to go on the internet and look for ideas for a date。

You're doing things you don't even like doing to impress girls that you don't know if you like yet and putting her above you in a way that doesn't convey your identity。

 That's almost all the commandments。It's not your fault that you've done this。 Everyone has。

Instead of doing this， ask yourself if you are living the life that you want to live。

Check back to your answers and three sacred questions。 exercise4。

 what kind of life do you want to live。If you aren't already living the life you want to live。

 start immediately。Then for your date， simply invite the girl on for something you are already doing。

If you are planning on going rock climbing， then going out with your friends to a concert。

 invitevi her along to do these things。 B her with。On the flip side。

 if you are planninging on sitting quietly in a room to do work all day， then go grocery shopping。

 then come back and sit quietly to do some more work After that。

 Invite her along to do those things as well。The command is。

 thou shalt invite her to join your adventure， not whatever adventure you think she would like most。

Speaking of her adventure， if she is inviting you on her adventure。

 but it is something you don't want to do， You can't go。It's not the life you want to live。

If she's not on board with the life that you want to live， then it's the wrong girl。Upon first look。

 you might see this as unreasonable or unrelatable in every relationship。

 there are going to be trade offs and sacrifices， right。

The dating life you are building by following these commandments is going to be legendary。

And that is because it comes from a place of abundance， not scarcity。

Making trade offs comes from a place of scarcity。There are literally billions of women。

 and you'll end up talking to tens of thousands of them。

If she's not excited to join the adventure that you're currently living， some other girl will be。

 and you will both be happier in the long term because you both get to be doing the things you both want to do。

If none of the 10，000 girls you end up talking to want to get on your terms。

 you can talk to 10000 more。There are literally billions to choose from。

You have to say no to the good。 so you can say yes to the great。

 and you have to get rid of the great to make room for the excellent。For example。

 something I've noticed from Derick personally and from other assistants that would win with him is that if any girl decides to give him any shit at all that he didn't want to put up with。

 he would simply leave。That's his version of a takeaway。 If you're familiar with this tactic。

A takeaway in pickup theory is a tactic where you leave the interaction on a high note so that she feels a sense of loss and she feels excited when you actually come back。

 which forms a stronger connection。Like Derek had mentioned before。

 you can get good at this game by being either a great man or a great manipulator。

 and both will take about the same amount of time。When Derrerick doesn't take away。

 he's actually not coming back because he knows his value and prioritizes his own lifestyle above some girl that he just met。

The command， again， is， thou shalt invite her to join your adventure。

 Not thou shalt join her adventure。She doesn't really care about what you end up doing with her or for a date。

 for example， what matters more to her is that she gets to know you and gets to experience you and decide whether she wants to continue on your experience。

Back to the nightcl and our original question， Where did you take her next。

Let's look back at your pickup model up until this point。

You have been amusing yourself and gathering logistics from her up until this point。

 thus compelling her emotionally and understanding her social logistics。

If your personality was sufficiently compelling at the start of the interaction。

 she's more compelled about who you are than where you take her。

She's currently riding the Travis experience at this point， and she knows it， Too。

 So it doesn't really matter that much where you decide to take her next。

 Just the fact that you are inviting her on your adventure。

So simply take her anywhere that you feel like All that really matters here is that you go and move her somewhere else。

Making the first movement requires a little bit of troublehooting here。

 They first tried doing this by asking the girl if they want to go with them。If you try this。

 the answer will certainly always be no， even if she actually wanted to。

She might even defer authority by asking her friends if she could go with you。

 to which their answers will most definitely be no unless they're all so bored and they have nothing else to do。

 Or if you have been sufficiently compelling to them。

You have to actually tell her what to do if you expect her to come with。

The next version guys will try is that they'll say， hey。

 let's go over here and then they'll pause and wait for her reaction。

Even though you are technically telling her what to do。

 you are basically still asking her since you are implying her input by waiting for her response。

 This is still better than asking， but we could do better just yet。

Something really funny that guys will do is that they'll start seeding the first movement。

Seating is a useful tool for pooling， where you mentioned something of high value or intriguing from your place like the view or your herbal tea collection。

 So when the time to leave comes instead of saying， hey， let's go to my place for sex。

 You could say something less abrasive， like， hey， let's go see this amazing view or my herbal tea collection or whatever else you decide to seed the pool with。

😊，Instead of doing this， the guys will start looking at the bar and seating the dance floor。

 saying like， hey， the dance floorer looks really cool。 Or have you been to the patio yet。

 I might go there in a bit。 or damn。 the bar is really empty。

 It must be really easy to get some drinks right now。 I hear it's 50% off for shots。😊，To me。

 this is a hilarious procrastination technique to watch， but it's a procrastination technique。

Nonetheless， you don't need to seed the first movement。

 Just announce that you're going to go over there。 and she's coming with。😊。

The next version is that guys will say， hey， let's go over here， wherever here might be。

 but they're giving off obvious indicators that she's not supposed to go with you or that you're nervous about taking her somewhere。

Again， the words are 7% to 10% of the communication。

 If she's reading from your body language that you are uncomfortable leading her somewhere。

 she's not going to go with。He might be surprised， but this is actually a terrifying experience for a girl the same way our brains freak out when approaching an attractive woman。

 their brains freak out when they are around men who aren't confident。

She might be terrified because she doesn't think that men are nervous when doing this。

 She just immediately has to assume that you have bad intentions。

Women have to face much more severe dangers than men do。 So these are real fears。

Another response is that she might get mad because she sees you getting in the way of her finding a more confident man or you taking her fun away。

As a solution， put her at ease and help her accomplish her goals by being the confident man and being confident about your move。

You might think it's rude or impolite or too forward just grabbing her hand and moving。

 But if you give her the opportunity to think， then she goes back into that logical head space。

 The better strategy is just to start leading her and let her say no if she doesn't dig it。

So as you allow her a space to leave， you can be rather forward in your escalation。

So what is the right way to move these women。When you are talking to these women。

 they have to make a trade off between staying where they are and going with you。

 and they are not going to go anywhere foril logical reasons。

She'll go or stay for that matter because she is emotionally compelled to do so。

When you go approach a girl and she is learning more and more about you second by second。

 the first impression you make on her sets the tone for everything。 If you are positive。

 dominant and confident， she's going to feel really good about taking your lead when you decide to move her。

 If you' are negative， anxious， unsure or acting incongruently。

 Then she's going inside of her body to see how she feels and everything her body is saying， no。😊。

The right way to move these women is to bring the confidence。

 certainty and fun that you've already been cultivating in these past commandments。

 And then you want to bring that same type of confidence。

 certainty and fun around the next place you want to take her。

If she's emotionally compelled to move with you， then she will。

Girls want a guy who is excited about his own life。

Even if you ran into a pretty girl who is not attracted to you。

 she'd still want to see your living out your best qualities。At this point。

 I want you to cultivate the muscle of moving the girl by bringing confidence。

 certainty and fun around the next location。 and then bring her there。

 The best thing she can be doing right now is spending time with you。

 If she's not convinced someone one else will be。 Then simply bring her to the next spot。😊。

Couple of tweaks to make。 It will be easier to move her if she knows that she won't be gone for too long so you can provide a time constraint to ease her logical brain like two seconds。

 or just a minute。 or we'll be back just a second。 Come quick。Additionally。

 it will be easy to move her to the location if that location is near by。

 Like if I want to go to the dance floor， but it's too far away。

 I might take her to the bar or somewhere closer first if it's in between。Now。

 you might think in your head logically that， oh， right now is the wrong time to move her。 Oh。

 she has friends nearby by or she doesn't like me yet。 Or， oh， it's her birthday。

 She's probably busy。This is the best way to keep the interaction logical。

 But the moment you do something illogical， like taking your hand and moving her。

 the interaction becomes emotional for both you and her。If she is not in an emotional state already。

 grabbing her hand to move her certainly will put her in that very emotional state。

Her default plan and stated preferences will differ wildly from what she actually does on occasion because it simply feels good to go do something。

Feel the excitement and have a lust for that first move。😊，Learn to enjoy this tension and experience。

 All progress takes outside the comfort zone。😊，And remember， you're both on the same team。

What happens when she gives you a pushback。This is where pllowing comes into play。Left and right。

 girls will be saying no and or giving you pushback against moving the interaction forward。

Most guys take this pushback as a complete know and just leave。

Other less calibrated guys will continue to persist and push forward with the same thing that they were doing before。

Both strategies， though they are polar opposites， are ineffective。

The right approach is to take the whole interaction one step back and then do what you were doing before。

When a girl gives you pushback， it doesn't mean no， it simply means not yet。

If a girl is adamant about you leaving， however， then that is a good indicator to go do so。

 It is very difficult to turn around a set after you get fuck off。

 or if she threatens to call security。😡，For example。

 if she pulls back to your attempting to go move her。

 it means that you just have to go back to talking to her just like you were doing before。

 Just brushing it off before trying again after pumping your emotional state a little bit more。

If you go for the kiss and she gives you the cheek， go back to what you were doing before。

 unbothered by this response and go back to self amusing。More times than that。

 the second or third time you give this a try shall'll oftentimes go with。Other times。

 she's still not going with you。This might also mean you haven't established enough of a presence for her to feel comfortable with going with you。

The frame of having a 10000 personality that I had mentioned in previous commandments will help you convey a commanding presence that if a tornado came your way。

 you would remain firm and steady with thick roots that go deep into the soil。With this commandment。

 you will have to simply tell them what to do。Remember how I said in commandment one。

 how people are waiting to be told what to do。If an authority that she feels comfortable with comes around to lead her to better days in brighter ways。

 she'll likely follow that instruction。As Derek would say， provide direction， reduce uncertainty。

Use this heavy personality and move the interaction forward boldly， firmly， decisively。

The experience and adventure you take her on serves two purposes to raise her emotional state and to build an emotional connection。

Once she is going on a fun adventure with a new guy。

 her emotional state is going up and up the same way that self amusing pushes both of your emotional states open up。

😊，If she sees that you are free and on an adventure， she wants to feel that way， too。

 and will follow your direction if it means she will also be able to raise her emotional estate。

An adventure builds an emotional connection because it provides new experiences between the two of you。

You can either take her on three dates before having sex with her。

 or you can bring her on three emotional adventures in the club in one night。

 and you will have achieved the same emotional connection。

Human memory is stored in an area of the brain called the hippocampus。

 and the way our memories are stored in the hippocampus are spatially dependent。

 What this means is that they are tied to the locations in which you learn new memories。😊。

That is why it is easier to recall information that you study if you are sitting in the same spot that you initially learned that information。

When you bring her on two to three different areas in the club。

 she is essentially meeting you two or three different times。In other words。

 you have gone on two or three different dates in this one evening。

Remember how I said women don't have sex with strangers。 They have sex with men。

 They feel like that they know。By the time you're at the third location。

 you both will have the experience of having known each other for a long time。

I build upon this effect by escalating value reveal and escalating vulnerability。

In the first location， I'll talk briefly about some generally high value things I've done。

 like my career or travels。 and I'll tell her some personal stories about myself。

 so she has a sense of who I am by my background。In the second location。

 I'll ramp it up by revealing higher value things that I've done like some major accomplishments in some of my higher life goals and some even more vulnerable things by talking about some embarrassing things that happen in my life or some other turbulent life situations I've overcome。

😊，In the third location， I'm talking about some really heavy subjects。

 aspects about who I am or have accomplished that she's never。

 ever seen before and will reveal some extremely troubling things I had to go through in my life and in my childhood and how I overcame them。

By the end， she's saying things like， who even are you， How did I get to meet you and。

I feel like I've known you my whole life。Furthermore。

 you are resolving chaos for her in every situation。

 so your level of compliance and connection goes up and up for every new place you move her to。

If she's going to all these different places and is having an enjoyable experience each time。

 she starts associating her good emotions with following your guidance。In fact。

 even if you're not an objectively good looking individual。

 her emotions will be racing so high that she'll even see you as a very。

 very attractive person because her emotions are tainting her perception in a very positive way。

Whatever your adventure might be， be shameless about taking the girl on that adventure。

 Cultivate that shamelessness。 The Travis experience is something that I'm very proud of。

 Your own experience should be something that you are very proud of。😊。

It's your very own personal style。 It's an extension of who you are。

 You want to show it off to your friends。 You want to show it off to the girl。 It is the most you。

All of your characteristics are accentuated， most purified。On boot campamp， I'll ask， come on。

 let's see your version and help you cultivate this unique experience that is uniquely you When people see Drerick。

 they become the strongest version of themselves。😊，Again， the goal is not to impress her。

 but rather to impress upon her what you are up to。

 knowing there are hundreds of thousands of other women who be excited about you。

Each interaction should mean so very little。 You're excited when a woman leaves your own experience because it makes room for the right woman to join you on your adventure。

😊，Now that you've moved her to the first location， Exp to spend 10 to 15 minutes in each location before moving her somewhere else。

 It won't be exact， but you'll end up feeling it out。

It would be ignorant to believe there will not be down moments throughout this adventure you take on。

In order for her to trust you and to truly feel the emotional wave。

 there will have to be down moments。Emotion is not so much what one is currently feeling。

 but the difference between what one is currently feeling and one's typical baseline experience。

Feelings of happiness means that they are feeling better than what they typically feel。

 and feelings of sadness means that they are feeling worse than what they typically feel。

It cannot just be a high emotion for the whole night。

 There needs to be low points for the high points to feel like even higher points。

You accomplish this effect by leaning even harder into your own personal beliefs and your personal boundaries。

 This not only creates trust， but when there is a positive emotional moment。

 she could ride the whole way of moving from a negative emotion to her baseline to a positive emotion。

You can also accomplish this by setting your boundaries and holding them。

If she's acting in a way that you don't like， tell her to stop。If she doesn't like that， good。

 you could shift to another topic and you'll be able to raise emotions from there。If she leaves。

 it's not your girl。 This is not her fault。 If she doesn't know the line the cross。

As discussed before， setting boundaries raises your own perceived value as well。

 Se boundaries is also part of the Travis experience。

Let's talk a bit about the types of adventures you might go on in the nightclub。

He might go to the bar to get drinks。 There is no problem getting a girl a drink if you， too。

 feel like drinking。If she is asking for you to buy her a drink。

 most likely she's going to leave directly after she gets it。If you're not into drinking alcohol。

 grab a salter water with lime。 It's an easy substitute for an alcoholic beverage。

You will certainly end up taking a girl to the dance floor。

The one rule you need to remember is not to dance for more than two songs。After two sons。

 it's no longer your adventure。 It's the DJ's adventure。😊。

You might be tempted to stay for three signs and see， you know， you're still leading the interaction。

 Trust me，2 son。The dance floor is a place where you can establish lip to lip contact and physically escalate on her。

This will raise both hers and your emotions as well。

 But the focus being on raising your own personal state。

You will have moments where it is just you and her talking。When you are talking with her。

 you want to make a very special effort to convey as much of your personality as you can with a focus on revealing more and more of your personal and vulnerable and high value information every time she passes your test and you take her to a new location。

😊，Also， when talking to her， you want to convey why you and people like you are the best shit ever。

I am sure to let her know why my lifestyle is the best lifestyle that anyone could possibly live and why anyone else would be dumb not to have my particular lifestyle。

If I'm convinced I'm the best option， she'll be convinced as well。

You will have moments when you are talking to her friends and dealing with other men coming into your interactions。

 You can read more about talking with her friends and Derrick's Coning Cockbox Bible in the main area。

With friends， I want to take control the whole peer group and convey that I'm the hero and the best option for their friend。

With other men coming into your sight， ignore them and focus on the girl。

 There's nothing more frustrating than being ignored， and they'll dig a hole for themselves。😡。

He will have moments when you are introducing her to your friends。

You should generally be more excited about your own friends than you are of the girl and convey this information by always agreeing with your friends and building them up with a high value introduction。

😊，You will have moments when it is just you and her talking in a loud area。

Make sure you are close to her and that you are escalating fiscally as well。

 If you are getting pushedback from her， remember to go back to what you were doing before。

 try something different， then go back in again。 Keep the conversations light and emotional by dropping in some taboo or even dark humorour on occasion in between these logical interview style conversations。

 The darker the better。When you are having peak emotional experiences with the girl that you're moving around。

 both positive and negative， it is building an insulated bubble around the two of you。😊。

It will be very difficult for guys to come in or for friends to steal your girl back。

 because the interaction you're having is so unique。 The more intense， the better。

As a side note for dates， when you take girls on peak emotional experiences like high adrenaline activities like sky diving or diving with sharks or travelling somewhere far or some other intense activity。

 it helps insulate the interaction。😊，She'll be hard pressed to leave you because she knows she cannot find experiences like these anywhere else。

Back to the nightclub for every new location that you bring her to。

 you are building momentum on the adventure。 If she had good emotions for the first two or three locations that you took her to。

 then your compliance level will be quite high when you decide to move her to the pole location。😊。

If you are both in a very emotional state， this might be as simple as saying， let's go。

If she passes all the tests by engaging with you and your experience at each of these junctures。

 you can just take her home。If she doesn't， that it's not your girl， simple as that。In sum。

 work on the muscle of moving the girl forward to the next location。

Feel the excitement of moving the interaction forward by sharing your positivity and confidence to boldly grabbing her hand and moving her to the next location。

😊，You'll have to tell her what to do and let her opt out if she doesn't want to。

If you remember nothing else， remember this。 provide direction， reduce uncertainty。

Continue to gather logistics， convey your identity and have sincere fun in each of these locations。

 knowing that she is on your experience and that if she decides to leave， she is not your girl。😊。

Keep in mind all of the other nuances covered above， as well。

Relocate her two or three times before actually pulling from the club。Finally。

 cultivate your own experience。😊，You have a sense of the Travis experience。

 And if you've seen Drek on boot camp， you will have seen the Drerick experience， too。

 the way he interacts with women。As an exercise， what is your experience。

Sit down and write a paragraph describing this experience in detail。

Use your three sacreder questions answers to guide this question。

What sort of conversations would you like to have with this girl， Write these down？

What particular stories would you like to share with this girl。

 starting from the least vulnerable to the most vulnerable。

 from the most normal stories to the most epic stories。 Write these down。

What sort of adventures would you most like to take in a nightclub with this girl， Write these down。

You now have all the tools to consistently be able to pull from the nightclub and to screen for a girl that is willing to join your adventure you're having and your own personal experience。

😊，Never forget that if you don't move the interaction forward proactively， nobody else will。

Continue to apply all that has been discussed in previous commandments。 And remember。

 thou shalt invite her to join your adventure。
