 please okay。I just want to see a few more people Let me go to gallery wonderful now I see you all I看 so I would like to start with。

Just to say， I'm very happy to be here。那最开始的时候呢，我想跟大家说一下，我非常的开心能来自于这里。😊。

能够让你拥有更加美好的人生，美好的关系。And so I want to just start with。

Do I have a slide or I can just I say I know what's in the slides I can just start talking about。

My introduction to needs and boundaries那我接下来呢想跟大家介绍一下关于我们的界限与需求。那是否我有1个PPT跟着我说，还是我自己介绍就可以了。So。

Needs and boundaries， we call it a gift， it's a gift from the heart。我们说了需求与界限呢，它是一份礼物，它是来自于我们心灵的礼物。

Because if we know what we need， if we have self knowledge。如如果我们知道自己的需求是什么，如果我们对自己非常的了解的话。

And we have a skill how to express ourselves。同时我们有技术如何去表达自己的话。

It can make our journey with personal and intimate relationships very。U。Very nourishing。

 very healthy。他就可以让我们个人的道路以及我们所有的亲密关系变得非常的健康且极具滋养。And my motive for doing this is that I really believe that if our relationships are good。

We are happier people。那我为什么有这样的发心和动力去做这样的事情呢？是因为我非常的相信啊，如果我们的关系非常好的话，我们就会成为非常幸福的人。

 and we can become more productive， more。😊，Creative and we can become good parents。而且我们就会变得非常的有创造力。

非常的多产。我们自身也能成为非常棒的父母。😊，So learning about boundaries and needs helps you to become a stronger person in all aspects of your life。

也就是说，当我们学习了自己的界限与需求，我们就可以在生活的各个方面变得更加的棒。And ultimately。

 as we learn to heal our needs and our boundaries， we become more self loving， more confident。

 shall we say confident。那最终呢当我们学习了自己的极限与需求，我们就更加的爱自己，或者我们可以说更加的自信。We believe in ourselves。

 we trust ourselves。我们相信自己，非常的信任自己。😊，So what are boundaries， let's talk a little bit about it。

那么界限是什么呢？让我们现在来聊一聊 boundaryundry is basically。A space where you respect yourself。界限基本上是一个你尊重自己的空间。

Where you know how to protect yourself。在这个空间当中，你知道如何保护自己where you know how to stand up for yourself。

你也知道如何的为自己站起来举理力争。And where you are in in command， not in control。

 but in command of your emotions在这样的空间里，你是自己情绪的统一者，不是控制者，而是统一者。Now。

 many of us are brought up to feel that good boundaries means that you don't have needs and that you don't have emotions。

很多人啊在从小到大被养育的过程当中，被灌输的教条是很好的界限，就是我们不能有自己的情绪和需求。Perhaps some of us even learned in the family that emotions。

 having emotions， expressing emotions is not a good thing也许很多人在自己的家庭当中学到的是表达自己的情绪或者拥有自己的情绪不是一件好事。

And that's not quite true there is a good way to manage your emotions that is so much more creative and that's what I want to teach you in this course事实上并不是如此。

我们会有一种非常良性的方式去管理自己的情绪。那么这也是我想在课程的方式当中啊去教导大家的如会有创造力的管理情绪。When we were children。

 if we had a negative emotion that was not good because it seemed that we were disrespecting our parents that was not allowed当我们是一个孩子的时候。

好像我们的负面情绪是不好的因为这种负面情绪反映的是我们对父母的不尊重这是不被允许的。Or if we had a happy emotion and we were too much。

 we were too loud， we took up too much space and that wasn't okay，或者如果我们太过的沉溺于自己的特别高兴的兴奋的情绪当中。

我们就变得太过的喧哗了占据了太过的空间和注意力， especially for girls， girls should be calm。And not too much emotion。

 See emotion was a bad thing。对，好像特别对女孩来说，尤其如此，她需要非常的安静，非常的恬静。对于女孩子来说，好像情绪不是一件好事。

So girls were not allowed to be too loud and boys should not express tears or sadness because that makes them weak女孩子不应该太喧嚣男孩子呢不应该去表达自己的眼泪或者是弱点这个让他们看起来弱弱的。

So when we start to work with needs and boundaries。

 we first of all have to look at what did we learn in our families about feelings， about emotions。

那么当我们在开始学习需求和界限的时候，我们首先要着眼的地方是在原生家庭当中，我们获得的关于情绪的感情的一切。Because in order to have good boundaries。

 you have to know how to express yourself， you have to be able to talk。And show， not just talk。

 but also show yourself。因为一个良好的界限，意味着你能够很好的去表达自己的情绪，能够去谈论自己的情绪。但是更重要的是能够去表达展现自己。Now of course。

 if we've been traineded from an early age that we should not show emotions this is going to be a big change当然如果我们在非常幼小的时候被告知不能去表露你的情绪的话那它会给我们带来非常大的影响 because what happens if you as a child learn to suppress your emotions。

那发生了什么呢？如果在幼小的时候，你学会了压抑自己的情绪， and you marry a person who also learned to suppress their emotions。

那同时你也跟一个呃同样的人在一起了，他也学会了压抑自己的情绪的话。And when you get to be two adults in a relationship。

那当这两个人啊在一段成年人的关系当中走到一起， you don't know how to talk about what you're feeling and what you're thinking。

你就完全不知道如何去谈论自己所想以及所感受到的一切。So you treat the marriage like a job， you do what you think you should do。

 you see。We know what is expected of us so the only way that we know how to behave is to do what was expected right在这个时候呢。

我们对待关系和婚姻的方式就好像是对待工作那样，我们会从头脑出发去面对对方。我们当然知道对方对我们的期望是怎样。所以我们所做的一切都来源于对方的期望。

But if you're not able to express yourself or feel， then the relationship slowly。

 slowly becomes cold但道但如果你不知道如何去表达自己，如何去感受自己的话，这个关系将会越来越冷淡。

And what happens when the relationship is called， we feel lonely。那当这个关系变得越来越冷淡的时候，发生了什么呢？我们会觉得孤单。

We feel so alone， and。We don't know how to be close to someone我们觉得非常的孤独。

却不知道如何走进人 So why I want to teach about needs and map boundaries is I'm teaching a much more beautiful way how to manage your emotions。

 your feelings and your life energy。那为什么要交给大家界限与需求呢？是因为我想要教给大家一种非常美好的方式去管理自己的情绪，去体验自己的感受。

并且能够去掌管自己的生命力。Because ultimately， we simply want to be happy， we want to be alive， see。

因为最终我们要的都是幸福以及生命活力，看到吗？😊，And emotions are parts of our aliveness。

 So by learning what we're going to learn in this course， we are going to become much more skilled。

 much more。Professional， if you want to call it that and working with our emotions， our life energy。

 and also our needs。那么。精油这样的课程呢，我们就会更娴熟的更加呃正向的去掌握自己的情绪。因为我们的情绪呢就是我们的生命活力的一部分。啊，在这个课程当中。

我们就能更好的去面对自己的情绪，生命活力。And so I'm going to teach you about boundaries because boundaries helps you to feel safe。

那么在这里呢，我想跟大家讲讲呃界限。因为界限首先会让我们感觉到安全。Boundaries is a way to make your emotions safe。他也能够让我们的情绪更加的安全。

Safe for yourself。对自己来说是安全的。It's safe for others对他人也是如此。Yes。And also， it helps you to feel that。

You are。An important person that you are not。That you are that you have self esteem。

 that you have value， that you have self worth。那同时呢他也会让我们感觉到自己是非常重要的人，我们是有价值的，我是有自尊的。

So boundaries is about saying。They go together with needs。

 but often it's easier to start with boundaries and then go to needs。那当我们说到界限呢，当然它是跟需求相辅相成，密不可分的。

但是往往啊我们从界限开始，然后去到需求比较好。Now， part of our training as children is that we should not say things that would create conflict。

Then we must avoid conflict。那在幼小的时候，我们被受到的教育呢是我们不应该去说那些会带来冲突的东西。我们应该完全的去躲避所有的冲突和矛盾。

 and we should not say if if something doesn't feel good。

 let's say you're in a marriage and your husband or your wife does things that you don't really like。

 for example， that don't make you feel good。比如说啊在一个婚姻当中啊，呃我们的伴侣啊，我们的先生让我们感觉到不好了。

So you don't really know what to do， your training says don't say anything。

 don't unbalance the harmony， let's just keep the calm， let's just keep the harmony。

但是我们从小所受到的教育是不能够去表达这种不好的东西，我们不能够去打破表面的和谐，我们得要迁就他。So you learn not to say anything。

 you don't speak about it because you're afraid of conflict。

 you're afraid of upsetting things这个时候呢我们就非常的害怕去说出这种感觉。因为我们害怕让所有的一些和谐被打破失衡。

But if you don't say something， the harmony is only on the surface， it's not a deep harmony。

那如果我们什么都不说的话，所有的这一部分的和谐呢，它只是表面的，它不是一个深刻的。It's only it only looks like harmony underneath everything is boiling。

 it's either boiling or it's frozen， it's ice cold，它只是看起来的一个表面的和谐，它并不是说一个深度的，在表面它是看起来非常和谐的。不过在这个下方呢。

一切都是翻滚的或者一切都是冰冻的。So I'd like to just have a look and see。

How many people understand what i'm talking about because I really want to be sure that you know what i'm saying so if you understand just put your hand up我想看一下大家理解的怎么样如果大家觉得自己懂了请举手。

Yeah。Fantastic， great。Great， because we don't just want a superficial harmony， we want a deharmony。

 a deharmony， which means that you're allowed to express yourself if something doesn't feel good or doesn't feel right it's really okay to talk about it。

 I really want to encourage you that you have a right not to be unhappy。那么这个非常的重要，大家非常的好都理解了。

也就是说我们想要的这个和谐呢，它不是肤浅和表面的，它是一个深度的非常究竟的和谐。和谐意味着这一段关系当中，我们能够允许自己去自如的表达自己。我想告诉大家这样一个原则。我们有与生俱来的权利。

这个权利就是我们不要成为不快乐的人。😊，And when you learn to understand your feelings and your emotions。

 then you come to a very deep harmony with yourself。Where youre completely relaxed with yourself。

 there's you're not intention， you're you're natural， you're flowing， you're。Peaceful。

 that's the harmony we want。 and that's what needs and boundaries can give you is a real harmony。

 not。False harmony because in the false harmony， you're sitting on so many feelings and what happens？

那当我们能够感受到自己的情绪和感觉的时候呢，我们就真正的走进了自己，与自己处在一个深度的关系当中，与自己处在和谐当中。这样的时候呢，我们是既放松的呃，又非常的安住在自己的中心。这个时候呢。

我们没有任何的紧张的情绪。我们是自然流动且平静的那当我们处在这样的一个真实的和谐当中，不是假的和谐。我们就是与自己处在这样一个非常界限中正的状态当中。😊。

So we're looking for a real harmony， a harmony that promotes love。

And intimacy and peacefulness and respect。那我们相处在一个真实的和谐当中，这样的和谐呢，它能够让我们拥有尊重爱与平静和亲昵。

Because if you've repressed all your emotions since you were a small child。

If your emotions were not supported or were not developed。那当我们在小的时候学会了压抑自己的情绪啊，当我们的情绪表达没有得到支持。

没有得到发展的时候。Then what happens you get into a relationship and you don't know how to feel love。

 youre with somebody， but you feel cold。那这样会带来怎样的后果呢？也就是我们会走进一段关系当中，却感受不到爱。我们感受到的是冷漠。

You don't know how to show love， we show love by cooking but yeah are you hungry eat that's love。

 but that's not really love， we don't know how to show love to feel love。那这个时候呢我也不知道如何去表达爱。

我们可能仅仅是做一顿饭来表达自己的爱，你饿了吗？来吃吧，我们仅仅会用这样的方式来表达。You know。

 when this becomes important is when you want to have a happy marriage。

 you want to be able to express love and affection。那这个非常的重要啊，当我们想要一个非常幸福快乐的婚姻的时候，我们就需要能够自如的表达自己的爱和好感。

😊，Because so many people are married， but there's no love in the marriage。

 it's like two people doing what is expected of them， but they don't have a connection。

那一般在婚姻当中啊会发生这样的情况，彼此呢都感觉不到爱，彼此所做的一切都源于对方的期待。但是两个人之间却没有真实的连接和互动。

So step by step together with me and the Ts， we're going to let you start to feel your feelings and then when you feel your feelings learn how to manage your feelings without simply。

Repressing everything。那么这几天呢，所有的助教以及我就将逐步的带大家去，首先感受自己的感觉，感受自己的情绪，再用中正的方式去表达自己的情绪和感受。You know。

 if we repress all our emotions， if we repress all our needs， if we repress。When we want to say no。

 then we end up feeling lost， we feel depressed。如果我们压抑自己所有的感情，压抑自己所有的感觉，那么最后呢我们将会是一个迷失的状态，或者说是抑郁的状态。

So I just say it very simply boundaries is knowing what doesn't feel okay to you what is not good for you You know我想很简单的跟大家表达一些界限的概念。

界限呢就是去了解什么对你来说是不好的，或者说嗯不想允许的是什么，不接受的是什么。So we're going to do in a moment a small meditation with music where I'm going to help you。

To come into your body， because where do we start to feel things is when we feel our bodies。那等一下呢。

我会有一个简短的进心。那在进行当中呢，我会大家走进自己的身体。因为我们的感受是从哪里开始的？首先是由连接自己的身体，感受自己的身体。

 So how we start both needs and boundaries is we say I want to feel my body。

So if someone can give me a little music I want to do a guided meditation with everyone now a few words about this meditation需受请工作人员给我放一比较的音乐然后领大家走完个小小。

 so I want to show you something very simple。那现在我们将做一个非常简短的练习，请大家看我。🎼hands like this把双手这样掌心向上。

And I want you to say yes。🎼Your words。 How do you say that in Chinese， Yes，是的是的， of course是的同时说是的no。

 mail， right。🎼no，然后我们再将掌心朝下说不。🎼yes，在分上来说，是的。🎼し的。And then turn them over and say。🎼再反过来说不。

🎼how you said yes。Because as children。🎼We'tWe never learned to say yes or no。

🎼因为我们在幼时的时候并没有学会能够适以恰当的说是和不。我们在这里练习朝上 should you feel it in your body when you sayy。

🎼How your body feels。🎼去感受一下，当你说是的时候，你身体是怎样的。🎼And no。老是说听你。🎼说不的时候身体有怎样的感觉呢？ It's very simple。

 but many times we say yes when we mean no。🎼就非常的简单。但很多时候当我们说是的时候，我们内心的感受确实不and no， when we need yes。

 so we're confused。🎼很多时候当我们说不的时候，我们内心却想说是，所以我们是非常迷茫的。

so let's look at each otherand everybody just show this is a yesI say yes，让我们看着彼此对大家说是的。

And now we change it。🎼然后反过来no。🎼不。Won of。🎼Okay， and let the music slow down now and I'd like you slowly to。

Come back out of the meditation。And。🎼Feel your body again， Look around the room。🎼好，请工作人员帮我们把音乐慢慢淡化。

请大家回到自己的身体，你可以环顾一下你的房间，让自己的感官被拉到当下。P。And just feel do you feel more relaxed。

 do you feel more present， do you feel more connected， that's what we're looking for。

你感受一下你是否ex and connectedect去感受一下你是否更加的放松连在以及连接了。这就是我们想要通过静心得到的结果。

Part of what we are trying to do with this work on needs and boundaries is to create a relationship with yourself。

 to know yourself。那么在需求接线的这样的课程当中呢，一部分的目的是我们想要去感受自己，去了解自己。 because it's so important that we know。

How we feel。When we start to have a relish。因为当我们开始有一段关系的时候啊，知道自己的感受非常的重要。

Because intimacy means that two people who can feel themselves are willing to feel each other因为亲密关系就意味着两个能够感受自己的人。

愿意去感受对方。And for some of us， this means going back to being a child again and relearning everything that we learned in the family。

那么这就意味着很可能对于我们很多人来说，就是再一次的呃回到自己的小时候，去放下之前的教育，重新的再去学习感受和情绪。

Most of us were not encouraged to express our needs in our families我们大部分的人呢在家庭当中并没有被鼓励去表达自己的感受。

So when it comes to being in a relationship。We really don't even know what we need。

 we don't even understand ourselves。这样的话，在亲密关系当中啊，我们很多人都不知道自己的需求，甚至不了解，不理解自己。For some of us。

 it's really incredible to think that I am allowed to have needs， that's amazing。那对于某些人来说呢，他一想到哦。

我可以允许自己有需求，单单是这件事情对他来说就非常的惊奇了。And not only am I allowed to have needs， it's okay if I say them。

 that's incredible。拥有需求不仅仅是拥有需求，我还能够去表达，去展露自己的需求，这个太棒了，太不可思议了。

Now I'm going to say more about needs tomorrow because needs are more difficult than boundaries那明天呢我将主要的去讲解一下需求的部分。

因为需求的部分呢相对于界限的部分会更加的困难一些。So I want to go a little bit more with boundaries。

Boundaries are quite complicated， there are several types of boundary。那么界限呢呃它是相对来说也比较复杂的。我们会说界限它分好多种。

And。What we learned about boundaries we learned in the family。那么我们关于界限所有的知识都来自于我们的原生家庭。

 and most of us。Didn't really learn a healthy way of having boundaries in the family。

We looked at our parents and they were not really teaching us so good what this really means。

So we have to start from the beginning， so I want to give you a little lesson on the different types of boundaries。

但是我们在家庭当中啊却没有学会一个健康的界限。很多时候我们仅仅是学模仿父母的样子，但是他们并没有教会我们一个良好的界限是怎样的。那么在一开始呢，我就给大家上一个关于界限的小小的课程。

So the very first boundary， the very first boundary we all have to learn is your body。

我们所要我们所要学习的第一个界限就是自己的身体，看到了吗？身体就是你的第一个界限。And you're allowed to have control over who comes close to your body or also your physical space。

那么在这个身体的界限的方面呢，我们需要能够去掌控来到我们周边空间的人，谁能够被允许去靠近我们走进我们。 and also we call this your privacy。 This is your。

Your personal world， that's your first boundary。我们也会把它叫做是一个隐私的隐秘的个人空间。这个就是我们的首要接线。第一接线。

So I want to do a simple exercise with you so that you can feel this is my boundary and we do it like this。

We just tap your hand。那么首先呢我们做一个小小的练习啊，去感受一下自己的第一界限。我们先这样去敲敲自己的手。

手心手臂and then your arm you feel this is your body，然后去敲敲自己的手臂that's good去感受一下，这是我的身体啊。对，就是这样做。

And then you get to say this is my hand，然后你可以说这是我的双手。Okay。

 so everybody say this is my hand好请大家跟我一起说这是我的双手， this is my arm。这是我的手臂。Good， it's part of my body。

这是我身体的一部分。and my body is me，而我的身体就是我this is my body and my body is me就是我的身体。

我的身体就是我 let's just do that and I want you to say this is my hand。让我们再练习啊，我想让大家说出来，这是我的手。

This is my arm，这是我的手臂。It's part of my body。这是我身体的一部分。And my body is me，而我的身体是我。

It's such a powerful statement of I have a body and this body is me。这样的一个论这样的一个叙述是非常有力量的。当我们说我有一个身体。

我的身体就是我这是非常有力的。It's the very first step of being an individual， this is my body， my body is me。

这是成为一个独立的个体的第一步，这是我的身体，我的身体就是我。It's it seems so simple， but it's very beautiful it看起来非常的简单但是它非常的美好。

Now we're going to do something else we're going to define our physical space。

 So let me you接下来教会大家如何界限空让我能来体上隐私的感以及安全感这就体要 yours。😊，Who comes close to your body？当然你的身体绝对是你的。

所以你能够选择是谁靠近你我们这样去做这是线非好间。知到。Beautiful， it's， and lovely it gives you power。

 and now we do it to the sides这个能给你力量。接下来侧面my space这是我的空间。Let's do it again。再来this is my space。

这是我的空间。And you do it slowly and really feel this is my space一定要缓慢啊，一边做一边去感受，这是我的空间。

And it really helps you to feel safe and secure。And then we do it to the back。后面啊这个能让你感觉到一种安全感。

is my space这是我的空间。😔，嗯。And then again to the side再来到侧面， beautifulauful that nice。太没了。😔。

to the front然后前侧这是我的空间。😔，And then just closing your eyes and sitting inside your boundary。那现在呢关闭双眼。

坐在你的界限空间之内。嗯。And see if it gives you a safe and comfortable feeling。去感受是不是有一种安全感舒适感呢？

 if you like this。If it feels good， give me your hand。如果你特别喜欢这个联系啊，感觉很好的话，你可以举手想试一下，告诉我。Yes。

Wonderful， it's a simple exercise， but it's so healing， so healing。😊，这是一个很简单的练习，但是他特别的疗愈。

 And I'll tell you again why it's a hearing， because if you have your body secure。If。

You have your boundary secure， you can feel your heart。我给大家讲讲为什么他如此的疗愈啊，这个联系，是因为当我们能够有自己一个非常安全的界限。

一个非常的安全的身体空间，我们就能够感受到自己的心灵了。😊，Then you take your hands and you put them on your heart just I if you can see me me come back together我一样你可以像这样把双手放在自心这 on your heart啊。

把双手放在你的心灵这里中间。And that is how we start。Preparing ourselves for connection。我们就是通过这样的方式啊去让自己做好准备来连接的。

You have your boundaries， you have your privacy，你有你的界限和隐私空间。

And that makes it safe to open your heart，这就能够让你感觉到安全的打开心灵了。Because this gives you connection。

This gives you safety。因为他能让你感觉到连接和安全感。And it gives you the space to feel your heart。它还能够给你空间去感受心灵。

And from that。😊，When you have your own body and your space， secure and comfortable。And calm。

 that's harmony， that's real harmony。那当我们拥有了属于自己的身体跟界限的时候，我们感受到安全和平静的时候，这个时候我们所呃连接到的和谐才是真正的和谐。

 And from this， then you reach out to another person。 So next next part of the exercise。

 you you go to your heart。那么基于这个基础啊，我们再去连接到其他人下一步，我们首先要在心灵这里下一步呢。

 and your heart is not just a place of need and fear。 Your heart is your treasure。

 It's like you have a treasure inside a jewel。meanEveryone has it。

 everyone's heart is like a precious jewel。我们的心灵它不仅仅藏着我们的需求或者是恐惧。我们的心灵它实际上是一颗珍宝，非常珍贵的宝石，每个人都有。

 And so what's beautiful is you feel that you have this jewel inside and you open to another。

去感受到自己内在的珍宝，向外打开 to open your hands。打开双手，向另一个人打开自己的心。I and then back to your heart再回来回到自己的线。

 back to your privacy， back to your boundaries，回到自己的界限和私密空间之内。And opening again再次打开向外。

See when you have boundaries？When you really could connect with yourself。

 then you notice that intimacy is a process of。Reaching out to another， coming back to yourself。

当我们能够有自己健康的界限，并且连接到自己心灵的时候，我们就会感觉到心密就意味着向外打开连接，向内回归自己。 So let's do it reaching out。

我们一起来向外 and look at each other on the screen。我看着屏幕上的彼此，带着你由心而发的笑容打开。

 It's like you see each other and you bring this person into your heart。

就像你看着他 how beautiful your heart is。再把这个人带到你的心中，让他去感受你如珍宝一般的宝藏一般的心灵。You give your treasure。

打开你的空间真 take the other person's energy if you bring it into your heart。 Something so sweet。

再把另外一个人的能量带到你的心灵当中，如此的甜美。嗯。So this is what we call a healthy boundary。

 it's you connect with yourself。And you offer yourself。With respect to another person。

那么这个就是我们所谓的健康的界限。我们首先是把自己打开，并且把另一个人带到自己的内在。 You approach another person gently。我们轻柔的靠近另外一个人。

So there's a flow between me and you。那就是。and you在我你我你之间有这样一个流动。

And if you can bring this quality into your connections with people。

These connections can be very beautiful and very deep。 that's what we're looking for， delicate。

 respectful。如果你能够把这样一个质量带入到跟其他人的关系和连接当中，那一切都会变得非常的精妙，非常的美好。However。

 we didn't learn this in childhood， we learned what we're going to call boundaries were walls。

 they were walls so thick that you could not。Feel your heart and you could not share with another person because。

You learn to protect yourself with a wall， just imagine a wall， not this， but。This。那么在小的时候啊，非常遗憾的是。

我们并没有学到这种健康的界限。我们学到的是用一个墙来保护自己，去防御自己。在这样的状态下，我们就无法分享，也无法连接了。And when we confuse。

Walls with boundaries， we feel alone， we feel lonely。当我们把这个墙误以误认为是界限的时候，我们就会感觉到一种孤独。

So many couples live in the same house but they live behind。Emotional walls。很多伴侣他们虽然住在一起。

但是他们都居住在各自的情绪高强之内。They don't。Offer there's no flow of energy between them because the walls are so solid。

And this is really painful。那他们之间呢没有任何流动的连接和互动，因为他们的情感高强，非常的坚实，那这一切是非常痛苦的。Because we feel so lonely。

 so alone， so。Cold， it's so cold when there's walls， there's no warmth， there's no。Sweetness。

因为这非常的痛苦啊，因为当高墙在那里的时候，没有任何的温度，没有任何的连接，一切都是冷漠的。 So the other side of this。

Is what we call no boundaries。那么另一个极端呢，就是我们叫做的没有边界的东西。

No boundaries is that you do whatever somebody wants you to do without checking if it feels good to you没有界限就意味着别人叫你做什么你就会做也不会去感受自己是不是对的。

You're always available to other people's needs and this is often what happens with the parents we so focused on the parents needs。

 what does mother need， how can I look after her， what does father need。

 how can I please him that we forget about ourselves and that's called no boundaries boundary less。

那在没有界限的状态下呢，我们总是非常看重别人的需求。特别是作为一个孩子啊，我们总是会聚焦在妈妈需要什么，爸爸需要什么。这个时候我们就没有任何的边界，我们也忘记了自己。

We're always looking， what does somebody else need and how can I provide that？

But that makes us feel exhausted and anxious because。Well， we don't know if we get it right。

我们总是会去关注别人需求什么。这个时候呢我会非常的疲惫，非常的焦虑。因为我们总是会总是再努力也做不好的一个状态。

And that's what we call boundaryless now what happens in a relationship which is very strange you usually get a person with walls getting together with a person with no boundaries and this is called a drama这就是对于一个界限的误解啊那么在关系当中我们经常会遇到这样的一个格局就是一个带着情感高强的人遇到了一个没有边界的人这样的两个人遇到一起就是一个戏剧了一个闹剧了。

So I'm going to。Does everybody understand that there's two extremes walls where you really close and boundariesless where you have no idea about yourself。

 you only want to please other people。大家能不能明白刚才讲的这两个极端啊，其中一个是带着情感高强的完全关闭的。另外一个是完全的敞开。

聚焦在别人的需求下没有任何的界限，能明白吗？So that's the first level of boundaries。 Now I want to actually。

Do a little demo， and then we're going to go through the other levels of boundaries个界一层级啊大家做一个演示。

So where's Alice， I need Alice now田园在吗。so first let me explain to the group Okay so they程。So。

What we're going to do now is I'm going to do some individual work with a client。

 but by watching this。You're going to see how we can use this information about boundaries。

What I would like to do before I start is I want to go to the bathroom just two minutes and then I would like to work with the client。

 Okay， so I'm just going one minute to the bathroom。

 I'll be straight back thank you see later那现在老师呢他先去2分钟啊。

马上回来给大家讲一下这个流程那这个流程呢是一个个案的流程我们会看到啊在这个个案当中老师是如何使用关于界限的方方面面去帮助案主去解决个人的议题好那们大家也可以花这个时间去上个厕所啊喝点水2分钟之后回来10点02分。

Hes everybody back？All right， so I'd like to meet my person。OK我们通知一下学员，请学员尽快回来。我看到有一些人离开了。嗨，大家可以回来啦。

马上开始我们的个案时范。Okay。嗯。啊。So do I have the person on the screen， Alexex， yes？Okay。I'm ready。好，我准备好了。😔，嗯。

好的，已经通知学员们回来了，可以开始。We can start， Sharon。Where is she？And she is on the。pe speaker view view者Okay。

 fantastic hello。你好。😔，你好你好，hellohello。😊，Hello， okay， so I'm very happy to meet you。

 and I really hope we can do something beautiful together。非常开心的认识你我特别希望我们在一起能度过美好的时光。😊。

So I think a nice way to start is that you tell me a little bit about。

Your situation and what you would like to change。那你可以跟我们在开始的时候聊聊你现在的情况，以及你想改变的部分是什么。嗯，我现在和我老公。嗯。

两个人是已经冷漠了，有大概有45年的时间，互相非常的冷漠。We， I and my husband have been in Cold War for almost four or five years。

好。然后我有时候想尝试冒近他，走近他。但是他给我的态度就让我。让我也不敢去靠近。Sometimes I try to come closer to him。

 but his attitude has been showing me that it's impossible that's so difficult。That's so painful。

 I'm so sorry。Do you would you say that you have？How was it when you first got together was it a love marriage did you marry because you loved each other or was it a marriage that the family decided was good for you这个听起来真的是非常的痛苦啊那我想了解一下。

当你们一开始在一起的时候，是因为爱吗？还是因为父母的安排。嗯，是彼此之间，我和他在一起，那时候是觉得。有一些轻松的，就感觉自己可以比较放松。

I felt relaxed with him in the beginning。然后他他他和我在一起，他的快乐让我感觉到。

自己也觉得快乐 and his happiness influenced me in the beginning， I felt happy with him too。😊。

So in the beginning， you had a connection you would say，所以可以说在一开始的时候，你们两个的连接是很好的。啊，对，还是好比较好的。Yeses。

 okay， that's good to know。 So you once enjoyed each other。 There was happiness好，现在了解了。

也就是曾经你们两个人在一起是快乐的。😊，Was there？Was there communication。

 could you talk to him about your feelings or your needs？About your life， about。

Just about yourself in general。那么在一开始的时候，你们两个人之间的沟通怎么样？你是不是能够跟他非常顺畅的表达自己的感受，去沟通关于生命的一切方方面面。嗯，没有。

我基本上很少表达自己的感受，呃，也有偶尔表达出来，他也会是否定的这一种。然后他就认为都要按照他的去做，就是任何事情都是他就是对的，就按应该按他的来。然后我也是一直隐忍自己，就很多年。

我结婚有21年就基本上都是在隐忍自己的。I really show off my feelings and even though I showed off my feelings to him and he was really negative about it。

 he insists on his own way and we've been there for  21 years。

 I've been surprising my feelings and emotions。So。This is not an easy place for you and do you feel that your husband？

Is also missing something in the marriage。我这个听起来啊好像情况并不是很乐观。那我想问一下，你觉得在这个婚姻当中，你的先生缺失的是什么？或者有没有什么缺失？嗯。

他。他确实的。他应该也是感情情感压抑的那一种。就是特别的理性。然后他其实也是渴望爱。哎，但是我我却不知道怎么样给他。

I think he also surprises his emotions and he tends to be really rational， logical。

 I can feel his longing for love， but I don't know how to show him。Oh that's so sad。

 so what you're saying is there's two people in the marriage who don't know how to show。

Emotion or affection。哦，这个太听起来太悲伤了，就我可以这样说吗？你们是两个不知道如何表达自己情感的人，走进了一段回忆。OK you know。At this point。

 I think。Sometimes we have to work with the couple and sometimes we start just with one person in the couple那有的时候在个案当中啊。

我们可以就伴侣双方同时进行咨询，那有的时候可以择其一。So I if I would start with you， I would say to you。

 you are a beautiful woman and how can you find nourishment outside of your marriage。

 but without having an affair， because obviously your husband is distant that we know and right now I don't know what we can do about that。

那么呃如果是我在跟你单独做个案的话，我在一开始可能会说对我来说你真的是一个非常美丽的女人。那么我想问你的问题就是你是不是能够在你的婚姻之外找到一份滋养，却不以外遇的方式。那这个时候呢。

你的先生对你来说是很遥远的。我们先把这个遥远和距离先放在一边，我们只想感受一下在哪里能找到对自己的滋养。

a part of the problem in marriage is that we put so much expectation on one person。

那在婚姻当中一个非常大的问题就是我们给自己的伴侣加诸了太沉重的期望。So is there a way？That you can make friends with women。

 have companions， go play my Yong with somebody， go to a yoga class。

 go to a concert where you get out of the house and you get to expand your your capacity for friendship even。

有没有什么方式啊能够让你拥有很多的闺蜜在一起打打麻将，练练瑜伽，去听听音乐会，滋养一下自己。Is that possible that you create your own life。

 you stay in the marriage？I would not say to you leave your marriage， I don't know。

 that's your choice， but I would say stay in your marriage， you have security。

 but develop yourself outside of your marriage。那现在有没有一个方式了，能够让你呃在婚姻的安全地带当中，同时呢又能够去继续的成长自己。

因为我不能够去建议你走出你的婚姻，还有很多的细节，我不是非常清楚。那么是否有这样的方式能够在婚姻之之外滋养你帮助你成长。And， you know。

 you might even discover if you go and make yourself happy。See。

 two unhappy people can't make anybody happy。看到吗？两个不幸福的人，无法让对方幸福。

And sometimes it's really good to accept， well， my husband cannot give me what I need。

也有的时候 like that right now，有的时候我们就不得不去接纳我的丈夫，我的先生没有办法让我幸福。现在看起来你就是这样的情况。

And it sounds like if you try to talk to him about it， he's not very receptive to you。 Is that right。

听起来好像是如果你尝试跟他去谈这方面的话题，他也不是特别的接纳，是这样吗？So it's a little bit what we call it's a little bit stuck it's it's not really flexible at the moment所以现在呢这个情况是有一点卡住僵住的。

Now you can change it。In a beautiful way， you can say well。

This is my marriage and right now that's where I am但是你能够去用一种非常美好的方式去改变它。我们可以这样去想，这个就是我现在的婚姻状况。

But I have needs， see here we come to needs， I have needs that I'm not getting in my marriage。😊。

但是我现在呢有一种需求在婚姻当中是得不到满足的。So I would like to start with you telling us what are your needs。

 what is it that you need， but also that you're not getting because the first step is that you define your needs。

 you say this is what I need。我现在现在第一步呢，我想听你亲口告诉我我的需求是什么？先要去把你这些在婚姻当中拥有的却没有被满足的需求说出来。

So let me show you something when you say。This is what I need from you you give your husband the power when you say this I need myself take lets just start with that好给你讲一下这样的一个模型啊。

当我们跟自己的丈夫说，这是你需要为我做的，我们就把属于自己的力量交付给了他当我们能够说这是我的需求，我们拥有了属于力量我来这个我先从这个开始。

Just with you talking about what you need for yourself。Can you do that还可以吗？先从先从我的需求开始，不需要很多啊。I need。

 I want you to say those words， I need for myself。一定要说出来，我的需求是。What is it。嗯，我的需求我希望我。可以比较自由。

不要不要让我感觉到被控制的感觉。要有自主。I hope that my need， I hope I can。Be more free。 I can take control of my life。

 Yes， I need more space for me。 Let's start with that。 I need more space for me。

 And I think that's true。好让我们从这个开始，我需要更多属于自己的空间。我需要更多属于自己的空间。So beautiful， yes， you do。

 I need to express myself。非常的美啊，你表达的方式。我需要去表达自己。我需要表达我自己。Yeah。How does that feel。

 Does it feel good to say your needs，你感觉怎么样？说出来自己的需求感觉好吗？很好非常好。好色。I feel look better。 Yeah。

 you look better， okay。Let's say I， I need to talk with somebody。 I need to have a friend。

 somebody I can talk to。你现在看起来更美了。你现在来说，我想要跟别人聊天。😔，我希望有一个朋友能够跟他聊聊。我希望跟别人聊天，我希望有一个朋友能跟他聊聊。

You know I want to tell you something very beautiful。

 I know that if I would ask all the participants who would like to be your friend。

 I would have 300 hands up because you are attractive。我想跟你说一个非常我自己真实的感觉啊。如果我现在问所有的同学们，谁想成为你的朋友。

我相信我能看到300多只手都会举起来。因为你是一个非常有魅力的人。Let's do that。If you feel that you could be her friend。

 put your hand up so she sees。让我现在开始问一下，谁想做他的朋友，把你的手举起来。

You forget when you've been around someone who rejects you all the time。

 you forget there are other people who like you。因为当你一直 to因为当你一直跟一个拒绝你的人在一起，你就会忘记有多少喜欢你的人，我都愿意成为你的朋友。

Li it inlist it touch your heart，让这一切都走进你的身体里，去触碰你的心理。

See we forget forget thatrere aable person know beautiful the现的感情都如美好 That's right them again and again a loable person。

😊，是的，因为当我们一次一次的被这个人拒绝，我们就会忘记自己内在了美。Yeah。嗯。😊，嗯。We're a sensitive person。

 we're a loving person and you know I feel that you could be a beautiful friend because you're so sensitive。

 you're so you've got such a beautiful heart。我们如此的敏感，如此的有爱，我能够感觉到你会是一个非常好的朋友。因为你非常的敏感，能够体会到别人。

而且内心如此的充实，如此的有爱。Yeah。Yes。嗯。Yes so I want to do a very simple exercise with you I want to take your hands to your heart and feel I have a beautiful heart and I want to share it with people just do this movement with your heads just simple movement现在跟我一做个简单的动作我有一颗非常美好的心灵我想跟你一起分享。

我有一颗悲常美好的心灵，你一起。make me cry now。我觉得我眼泪要出来了。😊，被你打动了。Take a deep breath to your chest in。好先呼吸一下。

让你的心胸腔更打开一点，就是这样。y arebeauful。beautiful，非常美。So may I guide you a little bit more。

 can you handle a little bit more I said okay，我可以带着你继续深入一点吗。Okay。

 so let me just go over what we learned so far what we learned so far is。

For whatever reason you and your husband got stuck in your marriage， I don't know really why。

 but I can see that you're lonely in your marriage让我们现在来重复一下刚才我们所得到的一些信息，你跟先生走到了婚姻当中的一个僵局。

虽然我不知道究竟是为了什么，但是你看起来非常的孤单 and when we live with someone who doesn't let us in。

It hurts and it feels that。We stop believing in ourselves。

 we lose our self confidence当我们跟一个没有办法全然的接纳我们，或者允许我们走进他内在世界的人在一起的时候，我们会觉得自己非常的挫败，我们会开始失去对自己的信心。

And at this point， it's probably not a good idea to leave your marriage physically。

 but you need to take more space for yourself for your own happiness那在这个时候呢仅仅是在形式上解说婚姻，也许不是一个最好的选择。

而是我们要去给自己创造更多的空间来找寻属于自己的幸福和快乐。So I want to do a little meditation with you which you know we all support you。

So the first thing is I want you to reclaim， you understand， reclaim your boundaries， see。

 so we start like this， even if your husband's there you say I take my boundaries back。

那现在呢让我们做一个小小的练习，去拿回属于自己的界限。你可以这样， That's I take my boundaries back。😊，我拿回自己的界线。😔，不是。

I take my boundaries back， I don't let you hurt me anymore。我拿回自己的界限，不会让你再伤害我，就是这样， I take my heart。

我拿回自己的心，自己的心。😔，And I open my heart to people who are ready to respect me。我向那些准备好尊重我的人来敞开心扉。

像那些准备好尊重我的人，敞开我的心扉。Beautiful， beautiful now i'm not suggesting you have an affair that's not my job here my job is to unhook you from a very。

😊，Hurtful。Boning。It's not doing you good。那非常好啊，我在这里并不是在鼓励你去外遇啊，我在这里是想鼓励你从那个非常痛苦的纠缠和关系当中解脱出来。

And I want to give you back your power and your self confidence as a woman。

而且我想让你拿回属于自己的属于自己作为一个女人的力量 you don't have to always give yourself to somebody who is not receiving you。

 You don't have to do that， that's boundary。 I don't give myself to someone who doesn't value me。

 see，因为你不能够把自己总是交付给那个不想要接纳你和重视你的人，这个就是真正的界限，看到吗？That's a boundary。

 How does that feel this is a boundary I don't let you hurt me anymore。我不想让你再伤害我。😔，这就是姐些，感觉怎么样？

我不想让你就上 beautiful。you feelel better，你感觉更好了吗？😔，感觉有有力量一些。I feel I have more power now you do。

 that's really true。 Okay， so I want to do one more step now let me explain the step before we do it。

 you see。Your husband gives you security and that's beautiful， that's a good place to be。

So好让我让我再让我们再做一个练习啊。首先呢你的先生给了你安全感，这个非常好。😊，So this is what I would do， I would say to you。

 is there a way we could？Thank your husband公 give公公公全育公。老公。老公，thank you for all that you give me。

感谢你给我的一切，感谢你给我的一切，给了我分。But what you cannot give me， I will get for myself， say。感谢你给我的一切，但是你不能给我的呢。

我也能够自己得到 what you cannot give me。 I will get it for myself。😊，你不能给我的，我能够自己得到。你不能给我的，我也能自己得到。

That's true， isn't it， You don't have to be a prisoner。 He is who he is。 He gives you something。

 but what he doesn't give you， you take， you get it for yourself， that's power。这就是事实，对吗？我们不能够成为一个囚徒。

等待别人去满足我们所想要的一切。他不能给我们的，我们能够自己得到，这就是真实的力量。She。And you're free。 You don't have to leave。

 You don't have to fight。 You don't need conflict。 You just say， thank you for what you give me。

 But what you don't give me， I will get for myself。 I， I manage myself。 Can you do that。

 Can you even imagine that。这样你就自由了，这样的话我们就无需要去与他对抗，也无需一定要离开，无需要处在冲突当中。你能够想象你自己去争取你想要的吗？自己需要的吗？

I will find happiness where I can find happiness。我将会去那些能找到幸福的地方，获取我需要的幸福。

And you know what happens then something amazing happens when you start being happy in yourself。

 your husband starts to take notice of you he says， oh that's that's a beautiful woman I've got。

你知道呢有一些神奇的事情，这个时候会发生。当你变得幸福快乐的时候，你的先生就会不由自主的注意到你。他会觉得哦，这个女人这么快乐。😊，Sometimes。

 sometimes it happens like that。有的时候就是这样发生的。So tell me your thoughts， how does this make you feel？

可以跟我聊聊你的感觉吗？现在感觉怎么样？我感觉非常的感动。然后。And feeling so touched， so moved。Because you know what you did。

 you made yourself valuable， this is called。Loving yourself， respecting yourself。

 this is really what we're looking for。因为你刚才所做的一切让你自己变得珍贵，这就是爱自己，尊重自己。嗯。Yeah。Yes， that's good。Yeah。

太胖了太好了。😔，嗯。我觉得老师确实是非常能够看到我。嗯。And feeling being seen by you very much deeply。😔，你好。

I do see you and I find you very beautiful and worthy， worthy of love， love worthy。这样你就能够去找到属于自己的价值了。

值得感、佩得感，值得拥有爱。You know， I really know and I think so many women know how painful it is to be with a partner who has walls。

And you feel so alone in your marriage， but sometimes we can't do something about that person。

 but we can do something for ourselves很多的女人她们都跟一个活在高强当中的人生活在一起这是非常痛苦的我们虽然没有办法对这个人做些什么。

但是我们自己能够做一些事情来改变在自己的身上 just before we end you have a child right。那在结束之前，你有孩子对吗？s boy。是男孩吗？Yeses。

 does he live with you。跟你在一起吗？住在一起吗？对，我们三个人都在一起。 Yeah， three of us are living together now。

How is your relationship with yourself？你跟儿子的关系怎么样？跟儿子会亲近一些，we are closer。Good。

 that's good so also without becoming too over involved with your son。

Do fun things with your son because there's the love， the love is between you and your son。那么这个时候呢。

你可以选择跟自己的儿子做一些非常快乐的互动。在你们两个人之间的这份爱也等待被激活。😊，Okay。It's not that you expect your son to be in the place of your husband that's not what I'm saying is that clear and I don't think you do that。

我所鼓励的并不是用孩子来替代你先生的缺失，明白吗？But to your son you can show love， you can show your love for you。

而是说你能够去表达你对于儿子的爱。And he can learn that he can show love too that's such a beautiful thing if you can bring。

A loving connection to your child that， you know， that's so important。呃当你能够表达自己的爱的时候，你的儿子就学会了去表达他的爱。

当你能够带来一份爱去跟他建立关系啊，这个非常的重要。亲子之间。 the reason I want to say this is it's very common what I understand in China。

 If the parents are unhappy。 The mother turns to the sun and becomes。

And the son feels responsible for his mother that's not what I'm looking for知道 it's not healthy在中国呢会有这样一个模式。

也就是当婚姻不快乐的时候，母亲他会把注意力放到儿子身上，这样儿子呢他就会不由自主的感觉到自己需要为母亲负责，这个不是我鼓励的。I think you understand that， right？

我想你能理解我所说的是什么，对吗？So it's important to love your son and let him feel your love。

 but not let him feel that he has to be responsible for you。所以我想说的是，一定要让你的儿子感觉到你对他的爱。

但是不要让他感觉到他需要为你负责。Do you want to say something about that关于这点你想说的是。Yeah。我想。是的，我就是特别希望孩子能够幸福。

然后我也希望我和他爸爸之间能够有一个好的榜样带给他。Yes， I really want him to be happy and I hope me and my husband can be the role models for him。

😔，You can， you know， at this point I don't get a sense。

 I feel your husband is very far away in himself locked in his own， he's also lonely。

 but you can show your son warmth that you can do， you can give him the feeling that he's beautiful and that he's worthy and that he's allowed to have his feelings。

 that you can do that's such a great thing if you can do that and I think you can。你确实是能够成为他的榜样。

关为你的先生，我就不太清楚，我感觉他离我们非常的遥远，他所在了属于自己密闭的世界里，他也是非常孤单的。但是你可以你可以向孩子去表达你的温度，表达你的爱，这样他也能够去表达他的爱，这个是你能够做到的。

And if your son sees you happy， that's the best gift you can give him。如果你的儿子看到你成为了一个快乐的人。

那么这个就是你能够给他的一个最好的礼物了。 I'm very happy you hear in this workshop。

 because when we come to places like this， we can heal our heart so deeply。😊，我非常的开心能够在这里见到你。

当我们来到这样的场域当中的时候，我们会深深的聊愈自己的心。😊，O好吗？Thank you。 beautifulutiful to meet you。谢谢你，认识你真美好。😊。

And I wish you all the best healing。祝愿你能够完成完整的彻底的疗愈。Okay， so thank you so much，继续吃。Okay， everyone。

 let's take a 10 minutes break and then we'll come back， we'll talk about this work。 Okay好，10分钟休息一下。

回来呢我们将给大家复盘一下，也就是10点43分回来。Allright，谢好，我们现在去到这个问答的环节啊。hi， Sharon Grace has just sent you email。

 Please check that after the class。😊，Yeah， she wants to talk， okay， no problem。好。请大家回来吧。

I just send a message， yes。I just sent her a message， Yes okay。😔，Okay。

 so am I doing question and answer now， Sherry？嗯，田约，我们现在是问答吗？嗯。

OK可以 I think that's good After the demo， if people want to ask or say something that it gives me more contact with people。

 What do you think。好，刚好在演示结束之后，大家可能会有一些疑问rry said嗯呃雪梨认为怎么样？现在问答。😊，嗯，可以的，yes啊，那想要提问的小伙伴可以把手举起来。

然后同时把你的摄像头 I want to take a little feedback and then I'm going to do a guided meditation。

 but I want to hear from the participants， so this is a really good time for me。

From what they noticed or how they felt when they observed the demo and我想听听大家的反馈啊，就是刚才的观察个案的时候，呃。

有怎样的感觉，可以在问题当中给我反馈一下。之后我们会做一个小小的静心冥想。嗯，好的，那我我会尽量平均的呃叫每一个班的同学啊。那我们先请四班的分子啊，西也和老师说一下，我会把那个同学调到屏幕上来。

他会看到 the student who is asking question will be on the speakers screen good lets begin。

I love questions。老师好'll go to speak。Yeah， she's already got you我记得你I've met you before之前见过你。😊，那个。

刚刚在老师的个案里面，我就感觉特别棒的一点，就是当我们去可以证实自己，就是证实我自己的需求的时候，好像我就可以有方向去满足他。嗯。

感觉 I felt quite amazing in session that when we start acknowledging our needs and feelings then we can have ways to meet our own needs ourselves。

是的。😊，是的。Exactly， very good， that's exactly right。😊，非常好，你说的非常的准确。对，而且经有自己满足自己的这个过程，让我感觉我也是值得的。嗯。

就从而认为自己是慢慢这种配德感和值得感，好像就会越来越多 and there is a strong sense of self worth that I deserve arise when we are able to meet our own needs。

 When first when we can。Claim our own needs and then meet our own needs。 Yeah， that's right。是的。

你刚才说的这个次序非常的重要。首先我们就是要知道去认可拿回自己的需求，然后我们就能去满足他了。exactly，you got it。然然后我的问题就是我很好奇，老师在在提到这个外遇的时候。

如果说我们在婚姻里面也渴望一种啊渴望一种嗯亲密的话，难道说这是一种途径吗？And speaking of affairs， I'm wondering。

 is that a right way of satisfying our needs if we long for kind of intimacy in marriage， you know。

 it's such a big question。There are times when it's really okay to have an affair and there are times when it's not okay and each relationship has to find that time now let's say you have a child。

就是 you have to。这是一个特别美好的问题啊。那么在这样的回答你的问题呢，我想说有的时候是可以的，有的时候是不适宜的那我们需要去在关系当中去分辨是不是这个实际是合适的。

Let me outline when I think it's probably okay to have an affair。

 you're inner a marriage and the marriage has no real connection。那我想跟你说一下，在什么样的时机是被允许的。

也就是在你处在你处在一个无连接的没有实质性的感情的婚姻里面。 and you tried everything you could to bring this marriage into life。

而且你已经竭尽的所能去维护这段婚姻了。And to separate is just too difficult， maybe for practical reasons。但这个时候呢。

完全的跟对方分开又不太实际。Then maybe and there's no children involved， no no children。

 children are gone or there's no children那也许呢这样的一段关系里面没有孩子或者是孩子已经长大成人离开这个家庭。

And maybe it's okay to develop a connection。That might lead to an affair。There's no harm in it。

 it's not harming anybody。也许这个时候呢，你可以去发展一段真正的连接。也许这段连接的走向是去向外遇这条道路。但是要确保在这个过程当中没有造成任何的伤害。

My concern about affairs is。😔，It can have an effect on children who live in the home and for that I would protect the children。

那我对于外遇有一个担忧，就是他可能会去影响在这个家庭当中的孩子。所以出于对孩子的保护，我可能会对外遇持保留态度。And why would it affect the children？

There's a way that。It confuses the children and makes them feel that there's not security。

为什么他会给孩子带来伤害呢？是因为这样的一种氛围，会让孩子有一种迷茫的感觉，他会觉得缺少安全感。So if there's children involved。

 generally I say it's probably not a good idea， but if there's no children involved and nobody will be harmed。

 why not be happy， honestly， why not？所以如果有孩子参与的话，我可能会觉得外遇不是一个非常恰当的选择。但如果没有孩子的话，那为什么不开心的去发展呢？

I hope that's a good enough answer。我不知道，我希望他是一个比较好的答案吧。😊，Okay， thank you， thanks， nice to see you。

Okay， we can take another feedback， another question or another sharing。好，我们可以看看其他同学的反馈提问啊，我们请三班的呃贺。

Okay。Yeah。哎，你好你好。😊，诶。我想问一个问题，老师就是。我想站在男性的角度。嗯。我听了刚才那那位同学的。啊。那个那我看到了他很痛，他心里很痛。但同时呢他也讲述到了其实。呃。

他先生也特别需要爱和理解。嗯，所以所以我想老师对中国呃女性的婚姻有了很多了解之后，那么。对于中国女性展现给你的他们的老公，他们的先生，这些中国男性的这种形象呃，是用理性啊，或者就是一个情绪的高强。嗯。

老是觉得中国的男性你 need a translation。嗯，不 just the final bit of the information。你刚才说对于男性的这个情绪的高强，然后呢。呃，就是我想说。

其实我可能跟那位同学的先生也很像。就是我觉得嗯我也是偏很很多理论的东西啊，然后其实我是想。有更多的情感上的互动，但是我就是没有那种力量能够去温柔。因为我我的成长也并不是呃能给到他，就是说。嗯。

两个人都在互相等待的这种状况。我就想问老师的，因为他对女性，中国的女性是同学也是女性比例比较多嘛。那么对男性的话。他的印象或者说中国的男性应该就是说怎么保护自己，或者说怎么去呃。

能够在这个婚姻的边界里面，能够呃让这种流动情淡了流动。呃，站在男性的视角上有什么建议？嗯，大概是这个样子，说的有点多。好的好的，可以的嗯。AndHe Sharon。

 he said from the demo subject that he could see she's really painful and but she also shared her husband is in need and understanding so I'm wondering what's her image of the Chinese man because I am a bit like the husband in that demo emotional war rational and I just don't have the strength to be gentle enough to support her actually we in the same pit waiting for love and help so do you have any suggestion for Chinese men to be more flowing in the boundaries of marriage？

Yeah what a beautiful question I mean your question touches me so much。

 you know I've worked with a lot of Chinese men and I I feel that Chinese men are incredibly beautiful and intelligent and deep。

你的问题非常的美好，深深的感动了我。我有很多很多的中国的男学员，我觉得中国的男人啊非常的美丽，非常的深刻，非常的睿智。

But Chinese men also are not helped or encouraged to express their feelings the opposite and中国的男人同样也并没有受到知持去表露自己的感情而且与之相反的去压抑 so Chinese men I think are even more lonely than women because they can't relate intimately to the wife because they so。

Emotionally cut off， they can't show themselves at work so they have so much pressure。

那我觉得中国的男人甚至比中国的女性更加的孤单，因为他们无法去连接自己的太太，无法去在太太面前表露自己的情感，更无法在工作上表露，所以他们的压力更加的大更加的孤。

 the pressure on a Chinese man and a husband for business。 first。

 he has to do the business has to make money for the family。那首先那男人面临的这个压力是赚钱养家的这是第一位 already。

 just the work has so much pressure。 Then you have a marriage， you have a wife who is dependent。

 That is very difficult。这个压力已经很大了，但是面临自己家庭当中的太太，他很可能需要去呃依赖你的呃养活啊，这个也非常的大。

 who needs a lot of connection， who needs this， who needs that。 So when you come home。

 there's nobody。To nourish you， there's more demand， more pressure。而且你的太太又需要你在情感上的交流和支持。但你回到家呢。

你面对的更多的是要求和压力，没有更多的滋养。 And for many Chinese men， then you also have parents to look after a mother。

 a father who you also are in some ways really responsible for。那对于中国的男人来说，还有自己的父母需要去照顾，这都是不可推卸的责任。

So for me， it's very important when talking to Chinese men， what do you need？

And what kind of support do you need because you have to carry everything alone it's really too much it's really too much那么这个时候呢当我面对中国男人的时候我特别想问他们一个非常重要的问题就是你需要的是什么？

因为你需要负担的肩负的东西有这么多那你所需要的支持是什么。What do you think， what do you feel when I said that that the pressure on you is really too much？

当我这么说的时候，当我说你们肩负着诸多的压力，你有什么样的感觉？呃，我现在可以说吗？y，你说吧。好，OK嗯。我想嗯。就是。🎼作为我只能说我自己，我希望我脆弱的地方。或者是我呃逞墙的地方，还有一些。呃。

自我证明了这些这些辛苦的地方能够嗯。在家里面找到一个位置，能够去。被看到。然后。我我我的力量不会被。嗯。我我的力量不会被另外一种情绪来自于伴侣的情绪。给打乱，然后就是明明已经。呃。

这可能是我唯一的一个可以保护我的地方了，但是却让我更加疲惫，更加的嗯觉得。哎，就觉得其实很没劲，就是觉得。😊，为什么会是这样？为什么？在这里也得不到更多的。理解或者是说我也没有要求很多。

我可能我只是想要。能够被看到那那那一那一部分，就是然后我可能会觉得。受到的理解和尊重嗯。那么。那我可能我会觉得心里就放松多就舒服 I can only speak for myself。

 My need is that my fragility， my pretending to be good or my tiredness could be seen in the family that there is no disturbing or exhaustion to my life energy because home or my partner is my only harbor to restore my energy back right exactly exactly exactly so maybe you need space for yourself。

 you need quiet for yourself， you need to rest。You know。

 these are what we would call healthy needs that you need space for yourself。

 you need time for yourself， you need to decompress。所以实际上你需要更多的空间，需要更多的时间，需要去修整自己。那这些都是我们叫做非常健康的需求。

And you need somebody who cares about you。而且你需要一个 about需要一个真正的在乎你的aming。Somebody is about you。啊。I。呃。

我我知道最后真正能够关心我的人，只有我自己。嗯，我以前不懂去向身边的人去嗯去要更多的关心和爱，只是觉得只有我去做到了一些什么事情，我才可能去。有资格去。要一下爱或者是说。有资格开口。嗯。

更多的时候其实是不敢，或者是说也不知道应该这样去做才是正确的。但是我同意老师说的就是。啊。这个方向是没错的，我要有我的边界，然后给我打造出来一个空间。然后同时也要让。亲密关系最中的另外的人明白这一点。

哦。我已经努力了很多了，嗯，我想。嗯，嗯我就我也很开启得德老师的答案，嗯，可能后面还有同学要去讲，所以我。哦。

我我大概就表达这些很感谢 ultimately I know that Im the only one who truly cares about myself I know that to be need to give or do something in the first place yout but actually veryable are关于你刚关于你刚才关于你刚才说的你需要做才能够值得拥有什么才能去要一些什老师说你的样子已值得的了。

😊，I've got a thought。I can imagine that all the women in this workshop who are listening to you are absolutely touched in their heart。

 I know it。我现在有一个灵感，我能够去感受到在这个工作坊当中，所有听你倾诉的呃这些女性的观众，他们都深深的被你感动了。

And all these women are waiting for a man who has the courage and the strength to show themselves the way you are right now。

而且所有的女人都在都在等待着有一个像你一样如此的勇敢如此有力量的男人能够去表露自己的心声和感情 that what you are doing right now is an honor to women and it's an honor to men。

 you're bringing honor to women and men。It's so powerful what you're doing right now。

而你现在所做的一切是对女性和男性共同的荣耀。你现在所做的一切如此的有力量。Because it's not so much about need that you're a child and you want to get something it's space to be to be。

To say what you're saying right now and just have somebody listen to you。那这并不像是一个小孩子的那种非常软弱的幼稚的需求。

他更多的是能够去创造属于自己的空间，去表达自己。Just to receive you， not to try to fix you or to please you or to feed you。

 just to say， wow。You touch my heart， well， that's it。你仅仅需要一个人，就是非常自然的这样去聆听你去接收你。你并不需要被取悦，并不需要被夸奖。

也不需要去喂养。你仅仅需要一个人跟你互动，能够去看见你。哇，这就是你本来的样子。That's what we look for， we want to be accepted。

 listen to and if we can learn something about that this week， you know， are you married。

 do you have a wife？你有结婚吗？你有妻子吗？太太吗？ girlfriend女朋友。呃，是的，我结婚了。然后我有一个嗯儿子，然后现在我太太怀了二胎，然后可能下个月也会有一个。

嗯宝宝就是下个月会有宝宝出生 Yes， I'm married。 I have a son already， and the second one is on the way next month。

 I have the second one。😊，And do you feel that your wife understands you？

Can be tender with you can be gentle with you。你感觉你的太太是不是非常理解你，并且能够温柔的对待你。嗯。我我不这么认为，就是。呃，这可能不是他的问题。

但我不认为他能够理解我。因为嗯可能我自己没有。走出来，或者他也没有这样的能力去。放下他的期待，就像刚才那个同学，他放下他的期对我的期待，而是他自己。能够给我更多的理解是先他放下对我的期待。

他对我的更多的期待都是让我觉得压力非常非常大。因为我我没有办法。我没有办法同时去。去扮演很多角色。其车。不是我不想。处。Good。不是我不想去给到。けし？给出更多答案而。Oh。那我真的搜不到。

Without the feelings， allow the emotion。去允许你的感觉，自然的流恋，不要去压抑你的情感。其实我已经很努力了，因为我我我我知道我们并不完美，但是我想知道我。

我就是这个样子，然后。我我我是在积极的往前走的，我并不认为他能够理解，但是可能需要时间和空间。I don't think that she is in the place to understand me right now。

 but it's also not her problems。I think in my because I'm not courageous enough to let myself out and she holds big expectations towards me that gives me lots of pressure so I want to say that it's there are many rows for me to balance and I it's quite difficult for me to juggling between things it's not that I don't want to offer my love but I already tried my best。

Now is a way that。Her needs and your needs， you're not understanding each other's needs I'm pretty sure you can work it out with your wife you're a beautiful man and I know she knows that。

那现在就是你的需求跟他的需求呢，两个人都没有让对方呢去了解。但是我看到你是一个非常非常美丽的男子，我觉得你跟他之间一定会去解决这个疑题的。我有信心。

他有意见 sorry now that I' listened to you。 I'm going to when we work with needs。

I'm going to help you How do you show your partner what you need。

 How do you find the courage to let her see you and to release the expectations。那么接下来呢我们学习呢将会去教导你啊。

如何能够去让你的太太去看见你的需求，并且能够有勇气让他去放下对你的期待。When we finish taking some feedback i'm going to do a little teaching about how do two people manage in a couple the needs of both people how do we do that that's the art of love。

而且呢在接下来呢我们也会去讲一个小小的关于爱的艺术，也就是作为嗯婚姻当中的两个人，如何去管理自己的需求和对方的需求。And I promise you， it's possible。

You're not going to be lonely all your life， you can really make your marriage work and I'm going to help you。

而且我想向你保证的，这一切都是可能的，是可以做到的。你不会一辈子都觉得是孤身一人的，你是可以让你的婚姻变成你深度的情感连接的。

Thank you so much for your sharing you are so courageous I'm really impressed with you太勇敢了，非常感谢你的分享。

😊，谢谢老师。And I know the TAs will also take this theme and take it further as we go on through the day那当我们在接下来行进的几天。

我们的助教也会在这个基础之上加深跟大家的学习。Thank you so much， really wonderful， Ta。

I'd like to say something about this before I take another person。那么在下一个问题之前呢。

我想说几句话 let's make a little teaching so。Why do we feel lonely in our marriages？

That we cannot really have deep connection。我们为什么在婚姻当中会感觉到孤单没有深度连接呢？

Part of the problem is expectations。一部分的原因就是由于期待。Let's look at it from the place of the Chinese woman for a moment让我们看一下中国女人的近况。

I've worked for China like more than 10 years and there's a pattern that I see in women。

那么在过去1年与中国的女性共同工作的经验上，我看到了一个模式。And one of those patterns is the several， but one is that。

A girl really needs to feel a woman when she's a girl。

 really needs to feel the love and the acceptance of her father。那么其中有一个模型啊一个模式就是当这个成年女子在是一个小女孩的时候。

特别需要感受到父亲对自己的爱与接纳。 She needs to feel that she was wanted as a daughter， that she was appreciated。

As a girl。但是要感觉到作为一个小女孩，作为一个女儿，我是被喜欢被欣赏的。And the father shows her attention and affection and gives support and has。

Has a closeness an emotional closeness with。他希望呢父亲能够对他关注，向他表达喜爱，而且两个人之间能够有非常亲密的关系和连接。Now。

 if a girl grows up and she doesn't have that fathering， that really。

powerowerful energy from the father， the love energy。如果这个女孩子在成长的过程当中缺失了来自于父亲强大的能量和林在的话。

 very often she grows up， becomes a woman。Physically， but emotionally is still a child。

但是往往往往啊他就会在外表成为一个成年人，但是内心还是一个小女孩的状态。And often what she's looking for in the marriage is not a husband。

 but it's a father。那这个时候在婚姻当中，他所寻找的就不是一个丈夫，而是一个父亲。I don't say all women， but very commonly。

 the father hunger gets taken into the adult marriage and there's all these expectations to be looked after。

那么我并不是说所有的女性都如此，但是这种对于父爱的饥渴，会让我们在婚姻当中对对方抱有一个非常强大的期待，希望她对自己的关怀是无微不至的。And unfortunately。

 that can never happen because several things， a man is there to be a partner。To be adult to adult。

 not to be a father to a daughter。非常不幸的是，这样的关系往往不会发生。有几点原因啊，首先一个男人作为一个成年男子，他能够创造的关系是两个成年人之间的。

而不是一个父亲对待一个女儿那样。And often we can never talk about this because we're not even aware that we're looking for a father。

 not a partner。但是往往呢我们都无法去谈论这个事实。因为我们并没有觉察到自己所寻找的是一个父亲，而不是一个丈夫。那。When that happens。

 it's very difficult to create a marriage of equals because the woman comes still as a girl。

And the man is somehow also not yet fully a man because he's so connected to his parents so it's very hard for the couple to form a unit assistant这样的话就很难出现一个平等的关系。

因为这个女孩子她还没有完全成为一个成年的女子，这个男性她没有完全的成述，因为他紧密的连接着自己的原生家庭这样的话两个人之间的亲密系统还有没有完全的形成 So what do we do about this right那怎么办呢？

非常困难。Firstly， we don't we first have to know am I looking for a father am I looking for a mother or am I looking for a partner what am I looking for what do I need首先呢我们要去觉察我是在寻找一个父亲吗？

寻找一个母亲吗？寻找一个伴侣吗？我正在寻找的是什么我需要的是什么 how do I grow up to be ready for a marriage of。

An adult man and an adult woman because we come to our marriages with so much child in us。

And that's why marriages don't work。那我将如何能够让自己准备好走进一段成年人的平等的关系里。因为我们携带着太多关于自己小女孩的部分了，就这样的话。

这个关系或者婚姻就不会有好的结果。So as such a big part of this work is about how do we heal the child in us so that when we get to a marriage。

 we can start to behave like an adult。那么这个工作非常重要的一部分就是关于去疗愈我们内在的孩童的。因为当我们开始走进这样的成熟的关系里面的时候。

我们需要一张成熟的磷在去滋养它。Okay， we'll say more about that and I hope that the TAs will work with you on the subject later today。

那今天晚一点的时候，我们的助教呢也会就相关的话题跟大家进一步的工作。那这个话题呢我也晚一点的时候会跟大家讲一讲。

Because the needs of the child and the needs of the adult are not the same因为孩子的需求跟成年人的需求完全不一样。Okay。

 so now I'll take another person。another participant那我们再接下一位同学的提问或者是反馈啊。好的，我提醒一下，大家，请写正确的呃备注啊。

班级学号加姓名，这样更容易教到你。好的，我们请。嗯，一般的梅眉。Great， hi。Yeah。哦。老师好，可以听到吗？你好，可以听到。嗯啊我刚刚在听的时候，其实也一直在流眼泪。感觉心被打动。嗯。

老师讲的也特别有共共鸣。就是在伴侣关系里。会感到孤独、心痛，没有连接感。而另一半呢可能也是在高墙之内，我觉得他也很努力的想爱我，但是他给不出来。那这样的一个距离让我。一直在成长自己，但也让我很苦恼。

因为自己的需求总是没有被满足。然后在这里打滚，让我很痛苦。所以我想听老师的指导，就是我现在还没有进入婚姻，只是在一段关系里。我该。怎样去更好的进入这个亲密关系，还是寻找新的亲密关系吗？

And my eyes were full of tears listening to you and I share the same feeling， loneliness。

 pain no connection now I'm in a relationship， not in a marriage and I share the same thing so my question is how do I enter into a more formal intimacy with him or I can just find and find another one No sure good question。

But what are you looking for in a relationship， do you know what your own needs are。

 what are you really seeking？好呀，我问一下你是否知知道自己的需求，你在关系当中所想得到的是什么呢？ when you meet a man。

 when you start a relation， what are you actually looking for？那当你开启一段关系，遇到一个男人，实际上你所想要的寻求的是。

我觉得我渴望的是爱和关注，但是同时我又会紧张和害怕。有的时候我给出来的反应可能会是生气和愤怒。I'm looking for love and attention。

 but I'm always intense， so sometimes maybe I show it in the form of anger and nervousness。Okay。

 okay。How how does a man show you love and attention tell me？你可以给我讲讲，当一个男人。一个男人是怎么去表达他的爱和关注的？嗯。😊。

我的需求可能会有身体上的接触拥抱，然后还有眼神看着我，然后给我。给我专注力。但很有趣的是，当我看到有异性对我感兴趣，表现出这种行为的时候，我反而是讨厌和拒绝的。但在我的关系里边，我特别渴望。我的这个。

这个搭档能够给我身体上的接触，包括眼神上的关注以及。以及就这种这种attention这种连接感。Maybe maybe we have really intimate physical contact and his his eyes are always on me actually。

 I'm I don't like this reaction from other men outside of my relationship， but I really value。

You saying something really important actually very good it刚才说了一个重点 it's really important what you say。

 you know。The physical relationship between a man and a woman is really important。嗯。

男人和女人之间的这种身体上的亲密非常的重要。And the reason for this is because if we didn't learn how to express ourselves with words。

 we can express love with our bodies。原因就在于啊，当我们没有学会去用语言去表达自己情感和亲密的时候，我们的身体可以表达出来。

So I would say between a man and a woman， the physical relationship。

 the sexual relationship is really important because in that place you can take your defenses down and you can really feel closeness because it's so important我想说啊这个身体上的接触或者说两个人之间的性爱关系非常的重要因为在其中两个人的防御权都会卸下在有一种非常亲近的感觉在里面。

So I think that's really important that you said that because， you know。

 in the physical relationship is the adult man and the adult woman。你说的这个非常重要，因为在这个身体的互动和亲密上。

就呈现出一个成年的男人和成年女子的状态。So that's good。That's the basis of physical relationship is the foundation。

所以这个非常的好啊，身体的亲密和关系是基础。 that doesn't mean every day。 it means sometimes。他并不是说每天都要这样啊，就是时不时的。

But it's important that in the physical relationship。😊。

You can express tender feelings and soft feelings and intimate feelings。

 not only physical release that's important有一个非常重要的就是在我们的身体的连接当中呢，我们还能去表达自己的温情，自己的柔软，而不仅仅是自己生理上的发泄。

这一点非常的重要。And it is a way that you feel loved， it's totally right what you're saying。而且在其中我们能够感觉到爱。

所以你所描述的非常的正确。But there's the sexual relationship and there's a warm physical relationship。As adults。

We need to show affection， not only sex， but also just。Afffection。

 is there word a Chinese for affection？ Yes，那我们所说的这个身体上的连接呢，除了性赖上的连接之外，还有一个非常呃温情的这种身体上的接触去表示自己的好感。

Three things are important。The body connection， the sexual connection， but also affection。

 just touching， just loving touch without sex， also important。那在其中有3点非常的重要。第一点呢就是我们的性赖关系。那除此之外，我们的抚触。

两个人之间温暖的连接也非常的重要。I lost my question made to go。I think the connection is really bad。

Maybe she will come back in a minute and the other thing is。Attention。

 love is attention that you just listen to each other。You just listen to each other。

 you just give each other attention。那另外一个非常重要的就是关注我们会聆听对方，会关注对方。

 the third thing is appreciation you say nice things to each other。 If we can start doing this。

 we can create healthy relationships。那第三个就是欣赏我们能够去对对方表达赞美。那我们能够把以上三点抓住，我们就能够去创造一个非常健康的关系。

I've lost my person。😔，So okay， I hope she comes back。

 but her point was very good it the physical relationship。Creates the bonding。

 the feeling of attachment of bonding。嗯，他说的这一点非常的关键啊，身体上的连接能够去创造两个人之间深度的连接。

 It creates the feeling of warmth and connection， So you don't feel alone。 You don't feel lonely。

 There's no point in being lonely in the marriage。这种温暖和连接呢会让你没有孤单的感觉。我们既然结婚了，我们为什么要感觉到孤单呢？对吧？

So this whole work on needs and boundaries is learning how to create the foundation。

 to feel close to feel really connected to someone and connected to yourself。那么我们去学习需求和界限。

就是想去创造这样一个亲密的基础，让我们对自己更加的亲密，对于伴侣更加的亲密。 So I want to take one more。

 and then I think I'm gonna do a little meditation just let me look at my schedule好让我看一下我的日程表啊。

那接下来我还想再回答一个同学的问题，然后我们就进入到一个小小的练习里。嗯。Okay，m to just do a little group guidance。 Okay。

 so take one more and then we'll do a little exercise。 One more们请二班的陈丹。你好。嗯。嗯。嗯。嗨，等丹能听到吗？嗨哎，你好，老师你好。

哎，很很高兴上老师的课。😊，呃，然后刚才老师的也哦，请问能听到我我的发言吗？能听到，你可以继续讲，有音乐啊可以关掉吗？哦哦哦不是嗯，因为隔隔隔壁有房间OK就是房间的呃人被练了。😊，啊，不意嗯嗯。嗯。

那个嗯好。嗯，老师刚才的呃一句话嗯，没我觉得。给予我很大的力量。嗯，就是说。嗯 no。你不能给予我想要的，我可以能够自己得到。啊，对对这句话我我我我。我觉得比较有感触呃。

然后通常的时候在大多数的时候在在一个关系里，我们都是会总是会不由自主，就是给对方很多期待。呃，会会总是会想到对方要给予我怎么怎么样的啊，满足我怎么怎么样的需求，从来没有好像似乎就。没有怎么想过，嗯。

有些需求我是可以。其实可以是自己满足。Sharon you said something which give me so much power you said which you cannot give me。

 I can give it to myself and usually when we are in a relationship we hold so much expectations we never think of that something too much。

😊，是的，我们都是有太多的期待了 I think expectations is really the biggest problem we we have unrealistic expectations。

我觉得当我们有这种不切实际的期待的时候，真的就会成为一个问题。And then nobody， nobody can fulfill those expectations。

因为没有人能够完全的去满足这些期待。That's why we have to spread our connections to include many people。

 obviously the sexual relationship is with one， but the friendships can be many。

所以这个时候呢我们就需要去打开自己的这个呃范围关系的范围。当然我们的性爱的关系可以跟一个人，但是我们友情的关系可以跟很多的对象。No。

Because if you if you listen to the man that spoke， he has so much pressure。

 men have so much pressure， so much。Responsibility， shall we say当我们在听刚才这个男性的朋友发言的时候。

我们能看到在男人身上肩负着非常多的责任和压力。 So if you imagine a man who has so much responsibility comes home and there's a woman who's happy because she's living her life。

 she's doing things that she likes to do。你可以去想象一下，每天非常疲惫的肩负着压力的男人回到家，看到一个非常快乐的女人。因为这个女人她做着一切想做的事情。

她所有的需求能够自己满足。😊，He can relax if a man who's with so much on his shoulders comes home to a wife who needs so much it's going to be very difficult for both那这样的话这个男当男人看到这样的女人。

他就会放松下来。相反他如果回到家里看到一个对他有更多要求的女人他就会觉得非常的有压力这对于两个人都不是一件好事。So that's what we have to do。

 we have to change our expectations and make them more realistic这个时候我们就需要去调整自己的期待，让我们的期待更加的切实可行。

So how does that feel to you？对你来说感觉是怎么样的？Yeah。嗯嗯。呃，对，这个是呃就是在调整调整自己的一单。但是同时我也会。对于我来说，好像就是向对方表达我的需求。

也有一见啊。是就是哇。就就是向对方表达我真实的需求，会令我有一种。有时候会产生一种羞愧感。就是会觉得呃我。不应该有这个需求啊，对，有时候会会产生一些这样的呃感觉，特别是当。当对方呃。

拒绝我这个满足我这个需求的时候，我这种羞愧的感觉会更加强烈。哎，所以我觉得这个有时候嗯。是一个给我造成一些困惑或者是一个矛盾。呃，我。怎么怎么样就是不切实际的替代。然后如果是所有的需求，我都自己满足。

No all right I need a translation yeah adjusting my expectations I wonder there is the opposite issue。

 which is I'm having right now， that I feel shameful about expressing my knees to people especially Of course Yeah。

 especially being rejected， so we if I want if I can satisfy my own my own expectations。

 then should I express my knees anymore how to balance right， good question， Okay。

 let me put that into a process now， let me take that into the whole group because it's。

I think your what you're fits everybody Okay呢基本上是每个人都要思考的就如平衡表一又习题感谢你。

So thank you so much for that非常感谢你。So Id like to do a group。 Thank you， really。

 I like to do a little group process because her question is so accurate。那接下来呢我们就做一个练习去针对陈丹的这个问题来做哈。

因为他提出的问题非常的精准。So I would like to see everyone， I think I want to go to gallery view。

要去一下画廊的试图看看到每个人的脸。 And I want everybody to just sit quietly for a moment and。

Just take in some of the things we've spoken about。那请大家静默的坐一会儿去感受一下我们刚才说过的一切。

And just take a deep breath。深呼吸。😔，And I want you to think about the times when you've been in a relationship and you've had needs。

去回忆这样的一个时刻，你在一段亲密关系里，你感受到了自己的需求。And you didn't know how to talk about those needs。你不知道如何去表达这份需求。

And how difficult it is sometimes to know what needs can you talk about and what needs are too big。

 too much。你很难去分得清哪一些需求是不切实际的，哪一些需求应该表达出来。So taking a deep breath。

 just tell yourself it's okay to have needs跟一深呼吸然有需求没有关系非常正常我们从这个练习开始 let's bring some healing to that inner child to tell that child it's really okay that I have needs I have needs。

让我们首先把疗愈带给内在的这个孩童，让他感觉到我有需求是非常自然的。That's where we start building our self love as you say to yourself。

 I have needs。我们就从这里建立对自己的爱，我可以有需求。And it's okay for me to have needs。拥有需求非常自然。

But let's just start with that ideal know needs。I have needs， and it'sO that I have needs。就从这里开始。

我有需求，我有需求非常自然。And some of those needs that are very。

How do we say important needs that needs that we're allowed to have， I need love。I need acceptance。

有一些需求非常的重要，比如说爱与接纳。I need space。To talk about things。比如表达自己的空间。

And just keep taking a breath and telling yourself it's okay to have needs。

 I'm allowed to have needs。持续的跟随呼吸自然的流淌，然后重复的告诉自己，我拥有需求非常自然，我可以允许自己所有的需求。

So you don't have to feel ashamed about having needs needs are natural这样你就不会对自己的需求感觉到耻辱，需求是自然的。

Take another deep breath。再来一轮深呼吸。Okay。And gently just。😊，Touch your body as if you say to your body。

 it's okay to have needs。 It's really I am allowed to have my needs。 That's important。然你可以轻柔的触碰自己的身体。

就好像对自己说，我可以拥有需求，拥有需求太自然了。And take another deep breath。再来一轮深呼吸。And now we have to expand our reality。

 which is I'm allowed to have needs and my partner is also allowed to have needs。

 we both have needs see that's already going into the adult。那现在呢我们要去扩展自己所看到的这个现实，我允许自己拥有需求。

那么我的伴侣有他的需求也再自然不过，这样就已经是一个非常对等的成年人之间的对话了。Oh， so you could feel like if it's only I have needs but I don't care about my partner's needs。

 then I'm a child looking for a parent see that's that's how you define it if only my needs are important but my partner's needs are not important then I'm a child。

这个时候你可以去感受一下，如果我仅仅允许自己的需求，不允许伴侣的需求，如果仅仅是自己的需求重要，伴侣的需求不重要，我们仍然是一个在寻找父母的孩子。

So I would like you to sit just in yourself and just visualize or imagine that a partner sits in front of you。

 you just visualize it， just imagine it。我邀请大家坐在这里去观赏，伴侣就坐在你的对面。So you imagine that now。

If you have no partner。Just imagine the partner you would like to have。如果你没有伴侣的话。

你可以观赏一个你理想中的伴侣坐在你的对面。We just do a little exercise， imagine that you bow to your partner。

 you just greet your partner with a bow， so let's just bow to the partner好去想象你用一个致敬再向他啊做做这样的一个敬礼啊。

向他鞠一个小躬，向你的伴侣致敬。Okay。嗯。And you say。I respect my needs。然后对他说，I respect my needs，我尊重自己的需求。

 but I respect your needs。Also。我也尊重你的需求。😔，This is being an edit。My needs are important。我的需求很重要。😔。

And your needs are also important。你的需求也很重要。😔，Okay。And I would like to tell you my needs。我想跟你聊聊我的需求。

 please， can you give me a safe space to tell you my needs。请你给我提供一个安全的空间，让我向你倾诉自己的需求。

And I would like to hear your needs， I'm really interested also in what you need。我也同样想聆听你的需求。

我对你的需求很感兴趣。And together。Let us see what's possible。然后让我们一起看看有哪一些新的可能性。And feel how。

How good that feels to respect yourself。去感受一下，respect your partner。去感受一下，当你能够给到自己这样的尊重，也尊重伴侣的时候。

感觉多么的美妙。 And then we do this movement from the heart。让我们从 from you让我们从。I take from you让我们重新来做这个联系啊。

我从你那里。H and you bring the partner's energy to your heart。你把你伴侣的能量带到你的心中，我从那里得到了。And I give to you。

我也把它给你。And I take from you。我从你那里得到的。And I give to you。我给予你的。😔，That's what we're looking for。

 my needs and your needs这是我们想要去做到的，也就是我的需求，你的需求都能够被照料。And just feel the feeling。

 There's something about that that is very。Grounding， it's very relaxing。去感受啊这样的一种交互，非常的能够让我们扎根踏实放松。

Because when we do that。We respect the needs and we respect the boundaries。当我们能这样做的时候，我们既尊重了需求。

也尊重了界限。It's not about。My expectations are so big and you have to give me everything because that keeps it。

😔，Stressful。这个时候。就不是说我们的需求很大，期待很大，你需要满足我的所有期待，这样的话会非常的压力，会非非常的有压力。

And then it goes further I know that there will be days when you are too busy to give me something and I am too busy to give you something。

 but we will find the balance。那我们再接下去深入啊，我们会在心中默念。我知道有的时候我太过忙碌，无法去满足你的需求，你也同样满足我我的需求。但我们会持续的寻找这样的平衡。

And it's very important to know that love succeeds when there's a balance of giving and receiving。

而我们会知道，一份真正的爱，若能要若能被建立起来，就需要失与受的平衡，就是给予与接受的平衡。Yeah。

想让大家去花一点时间想一下自己的需求是什么。 And I want you to think about what are my needs from another person and what are my needs for myself。

 What can I give to myself。And what do I need from another person？我想让你去想一想，我需要别人满足我的需求是什么。

我自己自身的出于自身的需求是什么？😔，Because growing up to be an adult。Is taking responsibility to know your own needs。

那么作为一个成年人呢，就意味着我们要负起责任去了解自己的需求。 So take some time to really ask yourself， what is it I need， What。

 what would it look like。再以花一点时间的去感受一下我的需求都有什么，他们是什么样子的。 So with that。
