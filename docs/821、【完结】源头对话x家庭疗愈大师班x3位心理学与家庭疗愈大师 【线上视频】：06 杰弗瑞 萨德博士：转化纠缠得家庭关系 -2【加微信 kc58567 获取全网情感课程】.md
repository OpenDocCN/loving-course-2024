就对于你们想要他成为什么样的人，在这一点上是达成一致的，成熟老师嗯打断您一下，就是我们不是说他像成年人那样成熟，我们是相希望他像他同龄人那样就是说对就是差不多的一个成熟度，就因为他毕竟是青少年嘛。

就是说没希望他像成年人那样成熟。他现在就是说他的这个心理年龄可能达不到他同龄的那个程度。所以对同学的这个看法的话，呃，是比较敏感的。这这一个我们俩就是说不是太善于沟通，小孩跟同学之间的沟通也存在障碍。

嗯。Let me interrupt to you teacher， actually what we want is not for him as mature as a grown-up but as mature as a teenager because what we want for him is to be as mature as his peers so that he could be healthier and be more positive。

 not as adult maturity because for now his psychological age is even younger than his peer that's why he's so sensitive and。

Both of us are not very good at communication， so he's also not very good at communication。这我想Yes。

Well。Okay， I think your perspective is very intelligent。是我认为你的视角非常的个明智。

 Some people grow and develop like this。有的人可以这样的速度成长 grow like this。而还有一些人是这样成长的。

 this takes more time for them to develop。他们的发展就是需要更长一点时间。 Some people enter puberty at an early age。

有些人更早一些进入青春期。Some people enter puberty， at a later age。有些人会晚一些进入青春期。

 There are different developmental pathways。发展有不同的路径。Yes。

 but the two of you are agreed about what it is that you want for your son。是你们俩对于希望儿子怎样，在这一点上意见是一致的。

To be less sensitive。他不再那么敏感 and to be developmentally at his age。可以在心理成长上匹配他的同龄人。To be strong。嗯。

你内心强大。嗯。Now。Your son is no longer in your control。而且现在你们的儿子已经不在你们的掌控范围里了。

He's living distant from home嗯。他生活在一个离家很远的地方， But the two of you are still disagreeing。

但你们两个人现在仍然有分歧 about an approach。对方法有分歧， but you're not disagreeing about the goal，但是对目标是没有分歧的。

 You're in agreement about what the goal should be for your son。对于儿子要实现什么目标，你们是有一致意见的。 No。

 is there anything else that I don't understand about your son。还有一些什么其他的，目前我还不了解的，你们有关你们儿子的事情。

 other than he's developmentally delayed。除了他在嗯。那个心理年龄上的发展上的实质。嗯，还有他就是在与人交往方面嘛就比较胆怯嘛，不敢跟人交往。

还有一点就是他在二年级下不敢去上学，他说呃同学对他呃就有语言上面的就是不友好，还有就是。嗯，他讲了一些情况，呃，就我后来跟班主任了解了，可能就是他自己自己想出来的。然后。嗯，需要翻译吗？

He's a very timid boy， and he didn't dare to relate to his classmates。

 in a second semester of that second year in middle school。

 He didn't dare to go back to school because some boys， some classmates were verbally not kind。

 showing no kindness verbally to him。 And I checked with the teacher。

 teacher said it might be his imagination。 He imagined so。后来他在家里面就特别恐惧，外面有声音，然后会认为有人在监视他。Yes。

 so later， he stayed at home got really scared。 Lots of fear about any sound outside of the room。

 afraid that someone is watching him。有幻听，然后到医院去，医生已经让他吃药了。He developed hallucination。

 auditory hallucination。 we sent him to school and the doctors medicated him。Yes。

So this is an even bigger concern。是，那这就让人更担心了。Will you be your son for a moment？妈妈，你愿不愿意现在暂时扮演一下你儿子？

So my， and dad， will you give your son。The message about being more， being less sensitive。爸爸。

你跟妈妈扮演的儿子讲话，跟他讲，不要再那么敏感了等等类似的这种。 mom， you act like， you know your son to be。

然后妈妈呢就用你所了解的儿子会怎么样反应来反应 be exaggerated in your sensitivity。可以把敏感度再夸张出来一点。And that， you communicate。

The message that you were saying before。然爸爸呢把刚刚你告诉我的那些，你的希望跟儿子讲一讲。嗯。不要再那么敏感啦，要强大呀，对不是。孩子嗯儿子。

那个爸爸希望你不要那么敏感，你讲的那个呃听到的同学一些评价啊评论嗯，都是有的是可能是呃是善意的，有的是恶意的，也有的可能就是随随便讲的。呃，跟跟你想的是不一样的，希望你不要那么呃去敏感去在意。

因为呃你活你把自己作为最重要的或者活成你自己心里的样子就可以了。嗯。不要去在意别人怎么看，怎么想怎么说。三。Be less sensitive。 And， you know。

 all the comments from accountsmates you you heard some of it are just unkind， maybe。

 but some are kind and some comments that made carelessly to you。 And， you know。

 everybody thinks differently。 and it might be different intentions， as you imagine。

That they carry with them。 So I really hope that you can be less sensitive。

 You don't care that much about what people think and just value yourselves。

 live the way you want to live。 don't care about what others think， what they feel。

 what their perspective of you is。No， mom， be your son。然后妈妈演里的儿子来回应。

 How do you respond to dad's message。爸爸这样跟你讲，你有什么反应？嗯。我听了爸爸说的话的时候，心里面的感受不是很明显，但是我我觉得。我可以想象到儿子的状态应该是。

内心还是有很多恐惧。然后还是有一些排斥。还是爸爸讲的这些话。嗯，说完了。Me， I personally， I didn't feel anything obvious in my heart。

 but I can imagine， I can imagine in my son's heart。

 he would be feeling lots of fear and didn't really want to hear what father is saying。Yes。

 so you would be。所以你就会是这种状态。嗯，是。If you're being your son。如果你是儿子的话， No， I imagine that if I asked dad。

嗯。我想象如果我接着问爸爸。Be your son。请爸爸来扮演儿子， you the mother。妈妈呢。

你就是儿子的母亲 and pretend that your husband is your son。假装现在先生就是你的儿子。And if you give him。

 what is the message that you would say to him？然后你对儿子讲一讲你想要对他说的话。嗯。孩子妈妈喜欢你。嗯。妈妈希望你嗯不用那么害怕，相信自己是可以做到的。

然后。爸爸妈妈永远会支持你。在你的身后做你坚强的后盾。然后无论你遇到什么样的困难和挫折，你都要勇敢的说出来。然后爸爸妈妈会帮助你。So。

 mother really hope you have no fear and really believing in yourself。

 your parents would always be your support and always be your backbone and no matter what difficulties and frustrations you would have。

 always say it， share it with us， We will always support you。😔，Now， be your son。

 Are you doing the same thing。那爸爸你现在是作为儿子在听，你内心也是同样的反应吗？这样的吗？我内心的反应觉得我们家孩子要要是。我我想的话应该是第一，他是不相信自己。

第二就是不相信妈妈讲的话。I imagined my son hearing that。 first of all， he wouldn't believe in himself。

 And secondly， he wouldn't believe in what mother said。So both of you are agreed。好。所以你俩都会同意。

In the essential message that you want your son to feel in his heart。他会同意你们两个传递给儿子的这些信息，希望儿子能够体会到的。

 And both of you are agreed that your son is so sensitive。ち。

你们俩也都同意儿子非常的敏感 that he doesn't want to hear your intelligent advice。同意他不会想要听见你们两个人非常明智的建议。

 what does your son do best？你们的儿子什么事情最擅长啊，我是做的最好。What is his most。Develop talent。嗯，他比要懂得最好的才能是什么？嗯。

他最擅长的是拼模型，那个像拼军舰，拼飞机1000多1000多块模型的话，他自己随便看看图，有时候不照图就可以拼出来。这个是从小又特别喜欢，也是做的最多的。What he's best at。

 what he's most passionate since a young child is to make models out of little pieces。

 like over 01000 pieces， he could make using his own hand without looking without looking at any maps。

 building the pieces into worship， into playing。In doing anything complicated。

 is very talented at that。In that area， he's an expert。你在那个领域，他是专家。In that area， he's very sensitive。

而且在那个领域，他是非常敏感的。But when it comes to dealing with other school childrenild。但是当涉及到要他去跟其他学校的孩子相处这件事情。

 going to school。当他要去学校的时候，他就会这样， His sensitivity is working against him right now。就在那些局面当中。

他的敏感度反而帮不到他。Now， I have allergies。你知道我是有敏感敏感症的，过敏。 So in February。就在2月份 there's pollen in the air。

空气当中花粉飞舞， and it affects me greatly。会对我有很大的影响。Most people， it doesn't affect。大部分人觉得没什么事儿。

逐渐的把自己暴露在过敏院当中。And you build up your immunity。以这样的方式培养免疫力 by a process of inoculation。慢慢的去嗯建立疫苗。

All allergies do not have to just be physical。而且很多的过敏症不见得是躯体层面。They can also be social。也可以是社交层面。Now。

 I don't know that he would be able to tell me。我不知道他能不能回答的上来。 If I said， what are moms sensitivities。

我问他，妈妈对什么事情敏感啊， I don't know that your son would be able to tell me，我也不知道你的儿子能不能回答得上来。

 You both seem like such strong people。你们俩看起来都是非常强大的人， You seem like you're heavily armored。

看起来有非常厚重的盔甲 that each of you has a lot of insulation。所以你们两个人都包管包裹着很厚的绝缘体。

 and in the spirit of desensitizing your son。鉴于想要帮助儿子脱敏。

I'm going to recommend that you share your sensitivities with your son。我会推荐你们建议你们跟儿子分享一下你们各自的敏感。

 that you exaggerate your sensitivities with your son。甚至可以对儿子稍稍夸大一下你们自己的敏感。

 And these could be physical sensitivities。可以是你们身体层面的敏感。Oal sensitivities。也可以是社交层面的敏感。

motion sensitivities。情感情绪层面的敏感， historical sensitivities。过往历史方面的敏感。

I am asking you to exaggerate your individual sensitivities。所以我是在邀请你们去解释一下你们两个人自己各自在哪些事情上很存在人群。嗯好的。

 and there's no guarantee that this will be successful。同时也无法就确保这样的做法必然取得成功。

 you can say to your son。比如说爸爸你可以对儿子说。I'm very sensitive to noise。我对噪音非常的敏感。If mom raises her voice。

如果妈妈对我说话的嗓门变大， it feels to me like I was getting into a bed with cookie crumbs。我内心的那个感觉，就好像是想要躲到嗯床上。

躲在被子里面吃些饼干来安慰自己。I can't be comfortable getting into a bed with cookie crumbs。哦，那感觉就好像是睡觉的时候，床单上全是饼干屑。

那个感觉很糟糕。And mom， you could say to your son。妈妈也可以对儿子说。I'm very sensitive to quiet。我对于安静非常的敏感。

When dad is quiet。当爸爸一言不发的时候。I'm very sensitive。我就会变得非常的敏感。

 this needs to be done in a very gradual way。当然我说的这些得要非常渐进的1。1点的去做。

 it needs to be done in the spirit of inoculation。而且是带着给儿子免疫的精神去做。

That your son is becoming more adult in his age。然后呢，儿子慢慢的根据自己所处的年龄的程度，1。1点成熟。

 Not as quickly in his social and academic life。但可能成熟的速度不会像他的学习速度呃，学业上的速度那么快，那么敏感。He under functions。

现在它的功能不足。You're two strong people。而你们是两个很强大的人 and you over function。你们呢功功能过量过度。

 I would recommend that you share your sensitivities。所以我会建议你们跟儿子分享一下你们的敏感柔弱之初。

And let him feel your weaknesses。好让他也能够感觉到你们俩柔弱的地方。

 rather than impressing him with your extraordinary strengths。而不是继续试图想要用自己非凡的力量，让他留下深刻的印象。

 at the same time。同时， you can help him to appreciate his talent。你们也可以协助他去欣赏自己的才华天赋， making models。

比如说他制作模型上的天赋。I imagine that you could build a very good life。我想象你能够打造出很好的创，创造出很好的人生。 onlyly talent。

你也可以过上很好的一生。 You all you need is one passion。你所有需要的就只只需要一个one talent。一个热情。

一个才能 build a life around that。围绕着这个天赋，才能去创造你的人生。So he seems to have a skill。

所以看起来他是有能力的 in building models。建造模型的能力。 And in that area， he's brilliant。在那个领域他非常的杰出。

In the social area， he's less well developed。在社交的领域，它发展的没有那么好。But people develop。Unevenly。

但每一个人的发展在各个不同的领域的发展都是不平均的。 And the important thing is how you enjoy the last 50 years of your life。

而更重要的是，你生命当中余下的50年，你打算如何去享受？And the struggles of adolescence are very difficult。而青春期的时候经历的那些挣扎是很困难的。

But you've both been through it。哎，你们两个人都经历过。And you can all three of you talk together。

所以你们三个人可以坐在一起来聊聊。About how sensitive mom and dad were。聊聊妈妈爸爸曾经在这个年纪的时候有多敏感， when they were his age。

在儿子这个年纪的时候。The simplicity of the message。传递的信息非常的简洁， is join him in sensitivity。加入到他的敏感之中。

This interview would be better if I spoke Chinese。如果我能说中文，我们的这个面谈会更好。

He doesn't respond。它是排斥的，是不反应的。Yeah。No， that's not easy advice that I'm giving you。我现在给你们的这些建议并不容易做的。

 You start by appreciating where you are。最开始的时候先要去欣赏他本来的样子。And especially because your son。

尤其因为你们的儿子现在是排斥的， isn't really listening to you。他并没有真的在听你们讲什么。

Then the principle is to meet him at his frame of reference。所以这里的原则就是从他的角度出发去看，去跟他相遇。

And help him to appreciate his talent。嗯，也协助他去能够让他自己自我欣赏，欣赏自己拥有的才能。嗯。We need to stop， I think。

我想我们要停在这儿了。Is there other questions that you have for me。你们还有其他想要问我的问题吗？呃，我我呃我想问一个，就是因为孩德现在吃药嘛。

因为因为期间疫情的时候，那个药寄不过去，中间停了一个月。但在这个月1个月过程当中还状态一直都很好。我就在想这个药能不能停。因我 because of the pandemic。

Delivery problems。 So his medication has been stopped for a month。 And during that month。

 he he is very good。 actually， So I'm wondering maybe we should just stop it at all。

This is not my area of expertise。精神病性的药物并不是我的专长， and usually it's advisable to go off of a medication slowly。

通常医生会建议逐渐断药。But you go on medication to target a goal。但是你们开始用药的时候，是指向要去实现某一个目标的。If you have diabetes。

用这个药也没有什么理由要继续用了。Unless he has a serious diagnosis。除非他的症状还是很严重。

And then the two of you can argue about that。那你们两个人可以就此争论一番。

But the medication is not necessarily going to make him。Less sensitive。但是药物不见得会能够让他这样，让他不再那么敏感。啊。

我是我也是这样认为的对。I agree。Well， you and your husband will have to agree。你跟你的丈夫之间得要达成一致。嗯嗯，我们俩不太一致。

我我是不 disagree不赞同孩子吃药。对，因为他现在的饭厅已经没有了，他在吃两个多月的时候，他现在吃了。将近半年的时间了，大这两三个月的时候，他就没有换钱。因为他开始的症状不是不是特别严重。

我不同意他吃药，但我老公一直想让孩子接着吃。He has been on medication for half a year and at the second and third。

 I don't know， half half a year。 Yeah， at the second and the third month， the hallucination has gone。

 so I don't really agree for him to continue the medication。

 but my husband insists that he needs to continue。Yes， well。

 that's something that you can fight about。是，你们可以就这件事情争吵一番。But when you fight。同时呢当你们俩争吵的时候啊。

May I ask you one more question？就是孩子现在是在老家上学吗？我想问一下，就是不是让孩子回到身边来，对孩子来说更好呢。

Because our son is studying。In the hometown。 And I wonder whether it be better for him to come back to us and stay with us。

U。I don't know enough to be able to give you advice。我现在了解的信息还不够多，不足以给你这样的建议。

but it's a sensitive issue。这是一个很敏感的议题 and can be discussed in detail between the three of you。

可以在你们三个人之间一起来详细的做讨论。And each of you will have strong opinions。而且你们每个人都会有各自非常强有力的立场。
