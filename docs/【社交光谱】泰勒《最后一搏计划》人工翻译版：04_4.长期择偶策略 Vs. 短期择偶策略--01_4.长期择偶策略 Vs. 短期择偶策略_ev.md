# 【社交光谱】泰勒《最后一搏计划》人工翻译版：04_4.长期择偶策略 Vs. 短期择偶策略--01_4.长期择偶策略 Vs. 短期择偶策略_ev

🎼，🎼，🎼，Hey up it's going from Real social dynamicss， welcome to a fine morning in Phoenixix， Arizona。

 right outside of Old Town， Scottsdale， where we ran a kickass program last night。

 and what I want to talk to you about this morning is the distinction between the logical part of your mind that gets things done。

 produces results makes money and fits into society and the fuck up emotional part of your brain that just lets you go wild。

 have fun， it's really a lot more primitive。And ultimately it's the part of your mind that attracts women and this is a very。

 very pressing topic for guys because what you discover when you're trying to meet girls is that the part of your brain that makes you a better provider that you thought was this amazing。

 beautiful part of you is actually fucking you up and the reason it's fucking up your shit is because you think that girls actually care that logically speaking you're a good option well。

 I've got news for you。How are you？I need kiss you。You。Have you ever kissed each other？

Let me ask you a question， okay， I'm going gonna to start this off with a pop quiz what do you think is a better way to track women option name Hi there。

 my name is Zan， I run an eight figure global business， I'm extremely responsible。

 I'm responsible for the livelihoods of over 100 staff。I take my role very seriously。

 I went to a top school in my country， I read a lot of books， I have a lot of things that I own。

 I live in a great house and I would like to take you out to a nice restaurant and show you the amazing life that I built because I think you're a very beautiful woman okay。

 that's option eight。Do you think that girls respond to that now， let's look at option B。

 we're in Scottsale， so we'll call it the Hey dance。🎼Okay。🎼And doing。For' coming this way。

All that shit that you did that you thought was important。For women。

 it was really important for you and the reason is from a woman's perspective。

 everything that you're doing is fucking compensation。

 anything law school that you have going for you she has disdain for that and anything that is just fun the implication behind it is that you're a high status guy you don't need all that shit and you're just having a good time and this is why you know the stereotype of like the greasy guy who's trying to impress a girl with this Ferrari and he's like yo girl come and see my Ferrari。

 how does the girl interpret that？Well， I'll tell you right now she interprets it as if basically you have no reproductive value。

 your low status。And so you went and got this material object because your brain was able to kind of wrap itself around that。

 but you weren't actually an attractive guy now the reason why that is is because when you get high status。

 something changes in you and this is what it is essentially you start laughing and becoming silly and having fun because your brain gets loaded up with different neurotransmitters when you're fucking winning okay so you know imagine walking into a room where you have very low status and imagine walking into a room where you have very high status。

What's the difference in your behavior in the low status room。

 you're sitting there thinking of how to impress people， you're thinking of how to。

Offer more value in order to get on the good side， but when you have high status。

 you're not thinking that hard because you're not engaged in the logical part of your brain because you're just happy okay and so really what I want to show you today is how to get out that logical part of your brain which essentially is pure compensation before I even get into this I want to make a couple qualifications first of all。

 I think that if you don't make good money， at least enough money that you're very happy with。

 you're fuck up I think that if you don't have a good home， a good nest， a good life。You know。

 all the things you want in life。You're fucking up。I'm not impressed by that。

 that shit doesn't impress me one bit if you don't have those things。

 I don't care if you fuck 9 million women， unimpressed if you don't have a life that you love。

But what I'm trying to say to you is that regardless of the fact that these things are important。

They are not game okay， they're not game they're simply important to you are you learning more tonight Okay。

 so what you going what are you going to carry with you？😡。

Well look how told me like I keep it friendly and cool for him。

 but I not trying to get something from it， just like keep are you getting more sets open tonight？

Yeah I mean there's a lot of more options got it are getting are you getting more open than usual Yes okay and what have you changed to allow yourself to get open more than usual Carefree more carefree got it Yes yes。

 good you feel what that feels like now okay and you can see the girls don't care about your accomplishments they don't care about you know your background they just care about the emotion that you're bringing that's it can I。

Man，I'm a nice guy， I' familiar life， how do you guys all do each other？

Do you want to come with our group or're cooler？🎼You're very sexy， by the way。 Thank you。

 Can I kiss you have to go， yes。わかる。So the first distinction that I want to make for you is between the short termm mating strategy and the long termm mating strategy and what I want to say this is very counterintuitive is that your brain is actually trying to feel out its environment at all times and say what is the best way for this guy to reproduce option A have like 80 kids that you never take care of most of them die。

 most of them don't make it anywhere but at least a few of them do right it's like the dandelion just。

Spread your seat everywhere Option B is maybe you have like three or five kids。

 but you raise them really well and they go on to do great things because of the time。

 energy and attentiveness that you put into those kids。

 So your brain's actually saying which strategy should I use now one part of your brain if it says shortter mating strategy it's like look do anything that you can just have an awesome time just make yourself laugh。

 make yourself out fun， do whatever it takes to do that short term right So whether that's drugs booze。

 clowning fucking off work， getting a job this's bullshit and not going anywhere。

 having idiot friends clowning around， ignoring responsibilities your brain says great。

 why does it do that because your brain knows that women just want to have fun and it pumps them in state and it gets you laid now the whole premise behind this is that you're supposed to do that so they' like 30 and then you're supposed to die because basically you fucked off your whole life but in like this amazing blaze of glory of your 20s right。

 fuck it awesome。You did all this crazy shit， party party party。

 bang bang bang girls are loving it three Sims with you orggie's totally different standard for you than a provider right and basically all this fast sex and orgies。

 you spread your seed far and wide， you never live to raise them。

 you never live to see your own end of your life。But it worked。

 you reproduce now the other side of it。You're the provider guy you say I'm not even going let myself get in a good mood unless all my doctor in a row have you ever felt that。

 like have you ever felt like you're out trying to meet girls and you literally can't even get into a good mood until youve handled all your responsibilities like there's onlys blocker in your brain's like he hey。

 don't get into a good mood you haven't handled all your responsibilities that's because your brain recognizes inherently that you're the longterm guy。

 You're the provider guy， So your brain won't even let you start having fun until you've gotten everything done。

 then you can have some fun right， you might have felt that before So that being the case。

 your mind doesn't let you do things to fuck yourself off。

 your mind is gearing everything towards long term。 Now for me。

 what is my strategy I have a bit of an inbetwe strategy。

 So I want to work most of the day towards my longterm goals but after that， bam。

 I want to switch it up and I want to go into fun mode and one of my greatest skills in my opinion。

 at least is the ability to go from being very logical。😡。

Thinking about deep topics to bam having more fun than almost anybody that you'd see So I want to be the very best that I can be at being logical。

 getting things done， producing results and being responsible。

 but I want this other part of myself that bam can switch gears and this is really a beautiful thing because when you look at the guys who get into this rut of just shortter。

 short term short term they always hate their lives later because the problem in today's society with the short termm mating strategy is what yet don't die I'd actually think about just fucking my life off if by 30 I'd be dead and I didn't have to deal with the consequences but in this society you're kept alive even if you fucked up and then you have the next 70 years if you looked 100 to reflect on the fact that you wasted your youth fucking around So that being the case what I want to do I want to train myself to find that in between part and if I can do that。

😡，And learn how to switch， build the synaptic pathways in my brain to switch。

 I can experience the best of both worlds We've got to get you open anymore I like that you're watching me but let's get you open anymore。

I'm opening the sets， keeping it calm but I just need something to really hook it。

I don't know you're talking game comes from within。Okay， yeah。

You think you're going to stay in this state and a line is going to fix it？What do you mean。

 you've got to change your state？🎼Okay to the ground。Okay。Got it。

We're gonna get in some deep evolutionary psychology here and I want to start off by painting some broad strokes and then zoning in on some really。

 really deep principles so a broad stroke right off the bat is that women tend to respond to you as a man when you're in something that I like to call state Now the word state is actually kind of a bad word because it's like this word that encompasses everything right like you're in state What does that even mean It's sort of a catch all term just for me saying that you're flowing。

 you're out of your head， you're sharing， you're not micromonitor you know worrying about people judging you。

 you're just in the zone okay it's a simple way of thinking about it。

 please don't get caught up in it sometimes I find the idea of state actually messes guys up because they become afraid to approach a woman if they're not in state。

😡，Whi is not a good idea。 You should always act right hear my voice after night doubt it's off still do a video anyway okay if you're out of state。

 you still approach anyway， but regardlesss of that when you're in state。

 that's when you tend to do the best of girls now where this gets crazy is your state criteria and this will be determined by whether or not your brain has adopted what I like to call a short- termm mating strategy or a long-term mating strategy and here's what it is your brain。

 it really doesn't care if you have a happy life or a long life。

 all that it cares about is that you reproduce and this is an evolutionary concept where most people think that your DNA is there to serve you like your DNA your genetic composition is there to be your needs but in fact。

 another way of looking at it is that your personality is actually what allows the DNA to go on So some scientists will look at it like a rocket ship with booster rockets and we like to think that the DNA is the booster rockets right like the DNA is propelling our personality to go on into space but what a lot of scientists say is that in reality。

😡，Your personality is actually the booster rockets shooting the DNA in space all that the DNA wants is your consciousness to move it forward into reproducing it really doesn't care and it's gonna to trick you and lie to you and make you rationalize whatever it takes to get you to reproduce so that being the case your brain sort of analyzes are you somebody who should have a short- termm mating strategy and impregnate as many women as possible but not raise the kids or should you have a long-term mating strategy where you work on yourself more so that you have more to do as a father and maybe you raise three kids or five kids but they do really well because you've taken great care of them so look at the distinction there。

Short term strategy， have sex with everybody you can， even if you fuck your life off。

 you don't like the party boy。But even if you don't raise most of the kids who cares because you had so many kids that just statistically。

 at least some of them will survive。 It's like a dandelion， just goes。Shoots everywhere。

 or are you going to be the long term meeting strategy guy where you really take care of your life and then you invest in your kids。

Now your brain will decide whether or not to leave you in state。

 your brain will decide whether or not to allow you to go into state depending on if it thinks that you have a better shot with a long term or a short term mating strategy。

Great shoes。H。Where are you coming from？Canada， one city I'm from Canada。kidding。

 that's where my great grandma is from forina。We live。He lived in a so house hi there。I know。Yeah。

 I grew up in Ottawa。I did， I'm from Calgary。Yeah。Who are you guys here with How do you guys all meet each other run guys rock grad？

I mean， I'm from Hollywood now so I'm just used to like meeting crackhor， I'm intimidated me。Okay。

 I love you I love you too。 Okay， what's your number Are you with any of the Canadians。What's your？

What's your snap name？What is it okay。He， kiss。you So if it's short terms your brain does。

 let me describe it to you， everything could be shit。Your whole life's in tatters。

 But what do you wna do party， I'm awesome， Whym awesome because I'm the shit dog， Why you the shit。

 cause I'm the shit， I'm awesome， I'm the fucking man I'm a boss。

 I'm a boss why because Rick Ros said so boss， boss， irrational， irrational selflove narcissism。

 That kind of thing makes no sense but all the guys that crush it with girls， they got that。 Okay。

 they feel great about themselves。 That's where swagger comes from right。

 swaggggedty swaggedty Now a long term guy。 He won't feel like that。

Unless his brain sees that everything's all perfect so it's like， okay， when my health is good。

 when my money's good， when everything's going perfectly in my life， my careers on the up and up。

 I've got a nice home to raise a kid， then I'll go into state and then if you do all that you get into a great mood right so he？

Why not do that But what I see happening This is what's kind of funny is that most guys really the best guys。

 the guys who should be doing well with women have this criteria in their mind where unless everything's going perfectly。

 if they go out to say a bar or a club they don't even want to be there their brain's like don't let him go in state he could go work on his marketing he could go study。

 don't let him go in state and so you yourself maybe you've experienced this where you're working on your life and then you go out to a bar you go out to a club and you literally don't want to even approach anybody。

 you don't want to get in a good mood and you're like you know what。

 I'll be in a good mood when all my ducks are in a row Stop thinking。😡。

Don't think thinking is the enemy， stop， stop。Thinking is the enemy，'s not stop'， stop stop。

Now look at me， okay？I'm going bald。Okay， we both know you don't care about that。 I'm going bold。

 Why don't I care though？You have to block this out。Block it out， relax， relax your jaw， smile。Smile。

こ以为。Let your tummy out， push it out， push it out。不是张样。Okay， keep me hug。Say present， smile。Smile。

Smile。I don't want to smile。Okay， give me hug。Here you sound awesome， why do you think that is？

That's called stifling you' stifled because you think you' get in trouble if you do it here so the girls see that so it conveys low status because if you're high status。

 you know you can yell and you know you can get away of it so by default。

 the quiet voice signifies low status low voice why do you feel like you can't talk loud here because you're afraid you'll get in trouble which signifies lower status got it you get convinced until you're healthy and wealthy and you have the nest and you're Mr your perfect and you're the complete package then you'll be ready and so your brain will actually feed you these delusions now pay attention because these are a massive delusions and here's what it is your brain will say to you you know what dude women like money Women like a complete package Women want me to be。

The man who's arrived。 and until I'm that guy it's not gonna work out， it's not going work out。

 even though the bartenders getting laid， the weed dealers getting laid。

 the club promoter is getting laid， the guy just drunk on a vacation's getting laid。

 but you tell yourself you got to be the complete fucking package to get laid。😡，In certain ways。

 this is good because your brain won't allow you to fuck up。

 It's actually a protection mechanism that your brain has where it says don't go in a state and start getting laid because if you go in state for no reason and you start getting laid。

 you're probably not gonna take care of your kids because hey if you're just sex sex。

 party party boom boom boom right， what's gonna happen You're not gonna be motivated anymore。

 So your brain doesn't to protect you from getting laid before everything is going really well。

 It's actually a protection mechanism But the problem with this is that in doing so。

 you put off meeting women maybe forever because in today's modern society。

 It could be 45 before you have all your ducks and roll。

 You should be having fun now getting results now and moving forward Now how about the short term mat strategy。

 what do you see with guys like that In my experience， what I've seen is guys who will drink alcohol。

 take drugs， have sex with any girl they can hot or not because they're just the del line。

 You'll notice this with subnats， literally they have sex with the hottest girls。😡，Ugliest girls。

 anybody doesn't even matter。 These guys don't use condoms because inherently they want the girls to get pregnant。

 They take any amount of drugs， any amount of alcohol because anything to keep the party going。

 They're like that kind of highris Boisterous ladish type personality Now the women see this and they goy。

 He's a short termm mat。 I can have his kid and make the longter mator raise the kid because women have the double mating strategy。

 They have the guy who has a good sperm that'll give a kid thatll give them tons of kids。

 but they also have somebody to raise it。 So they don't need you to give them sperm to trick you to think that it's your kid right look this up in a book called spermmores。

 check it out。 The idea of being that so many men could be having sex with women that your penis actually shape like a plunge to pull out other men's sperm。

 So women basically are just like look I'll have sex longterm guy。

 I'll have sex with short termm guy I' probably have some kids from the short termm guy。

 Some kids from the long-term guy who cares。 Now your brain what is's doing is analyzing the situation and you've got to be honest with yourself about what it's doing。

 Are you getting into that awesome mode easily or you like。😡，Everything has to be perfect。

 Everything's got to be good。 Otherwise， I don't want to laugh。 I don't want to have fun。

 I don't want to get laid right， Ex if your brain's protecting you。 Now， here is what I would say。😡。

The best space to be in is being able to shift gears because if you can actually get really serious and not get too cocky if things aren't going well。

 right， taking life seriously， moving forward， making money， being healthy， taking care of yourself。

 building a nest。 if you can do that for its own sake and then combine that with when you're out。

 you just start having fun。 Oh， you are a powerful man， my friend， you are a powerful man indeed。😡。

You getting to have a great time because your life's going to be the bomb。

 you're going to get everything set up perfectly， but at the same time， what's going to happen？

You're gonna be able to go out and have fun。 And this is what I've experienced。

 even during financial recessions when my business starts doing badly， I'm like， shit。

 things are sucking right now。 But the one thing that I can do is put myself in that great mood and get laid so that I can get back to work。

😡，🎼And actually feel relaxed。 Why do you guys think I take the pressure off myself early。

 Why do you think so Yeah， like the Al Mill space。 It's not like smell like。Right， just like。

Take it or leave it。🎼はいは你。Freckles， what's your name？🎼あはい。他专线。

We can't breathe because the kid will be so white it will get somemer， this is my friend Lou。Lookke。

My friends Li， you're amazing， how are you， Why are you so fucking dos？Right， you're so。🎼们在拿走妹。

I just I try to like take so much action it shuts off the thinking mine So it's just like this like happy guy who's just like right and it's just like this man is here and that's it what I'm saying to you here is recognize whether or not your brain is in a long term or short term mating tragedy and if you're having thoughts like you know。

 I've got to have everything perfect before I can be girl dude your brain is fucking with you your brain is literally rationalizing Likewise though if you're like my life is spoken awesome I'm the party boy I'm the party boy I'm shit because I got scar I got glasses。

Look at me， man boobies， favorite girls like the man boobies， then like the badhead。

 I look like the dad， she has abandonment issues right if you're going into that mode。That's fun。

 If you're likey， I got to be serious， I have to be responsible， I have integrity。

 I have to live by my values。 I have to meet my responsibilities。 I've got to work hard。

 I've got to build the nest。 I've got to be healthy。 I've got to live a long time。

 I've got to raise those kids。 Both of those are good。 But the question is。

 do you identify with one or do you identify with the other， The truth is， guys。

 I want to hear how to keep the fun going。 I have a better question。

 How do you have fun in your life。 yo that's the fucking problem。

 Like look at even your body language right now。 You know what'm saying。😡，Okay。You know。

 saying right because guys want to switch it on and off what I found is the more that that I make a decision to laugh in my regular life and then I'm with my friends who are laughing in the grocery store and then girls see it and we're like。

 hey。不是。As opposed to like， as opposed to。And then， like。Hey， which is fake as Fox。

 So what we're gonna to do now is look at the shortfalls of both short term and long termm mating tragedy so that you can avoid both and then we're gonna to look at the strengths of it so you can cultivate it within yourself。

 All right now right off the bat the short term matr is doing anything to protect his precious state if that means rationalizing delusions not taking responsibility。

 not handling business avoiding anything to keep himself in that party mood he's gonna do it Now these are guys that'll be dressed up in wacky clothes kind of fun carefree and girls get into that vibe right it's like that surfer vibe。

 that artist vibe where the girl just feels that guy is so at the moment so free and her mind is sayingy if I reproduce with him I'll have little surfer artist rapper babies that are gonna reproduce and I'm gonna have lots of grandkids So the girl goes for that The problem is of course that when you're preserving your state at all costs the rationalizations can completely implode your life in ways that you currently can't even begin to imagine。

But you see， the flip side of it is long term mater who's always thinking about the future。

 He has no swag。 he's not funny， He's too logical and not being in the case what happens to him。

In my experience， that guy doesn't get to enjoy life because he's always waiting until some better future。

 so each side has a cost and ultimately you've got to find a balance between the two， but really。

Is it that complicated， is this really that big of a deal。

 all that I say that it is that you're really trying to figure out is how to be in a great carefree mood while still handling your life。

But you see the mind， the brain， it gets trained on certain mentalities or ways of doing things。

 and so you've got to train your brain at one point to be in a very logical mode and focused。

 but at another point just to be carefree and having fun， they call this work hard play hard。

And so as a man。These capacities that you hold dear build an amazing nest to building a great life that a woman would appreciate someday。

It might frustrate you。The girls aren't responding to it， but understand that it's for you。

So that being the case， we have to find the middle ground and there's a part of your mind that's silly。

 primitive primal， the mating part， and there's another part of your mind that's logical。

 the nest building part and really the key is finding the ability to switch between the two it's hard to do It's hard to do right like a lot of people they can lift a heavy weight。

 but they can't do an endurance type of weight with a lot of reps Some people can do endurance。

 but they can't lift a heavy weight but when you have both that's a sweet spot that you want to get into That being the case you've got to learn how to let go logic is like this playfulness is like this and switching back and forth is the element of becoming really successful financially and in your life but at the same time crushing it in your game got I got bit I'm a littleby this year touch the touch it feel feel the maoo。

Heeal it， heal it。Do you like it know。ま个。I love you。I hate you know。🎼我呢。ドライで。

Like that you're beautiful American are。It Atlanta Atlanta be lot ofhawk girls that are reallying dumb。

I'm ready to take you back to LA， are you ready？What's your number？All right。

 so what we're gonna to do now is look at the two major skills that I'm going to need you to cultivate if you want to benefit from both the long termm mating lifestyle and the short term mating lifestyle and here's what is you call it the art of achievement and the art of appreciation Now the art of achievement you can read a great book by Cal Newport called Deep work and this goes into the power of extended focus most people in society these days have a very disperse focus that comes from all these social media websites and you know micro content where you don't have to focus you're changing the channel you can't focus on anything and when you actually make the decision to do deep work to focus very deeply what winds up happening is that you get a very very powerful intellect in a particular topic that produces value for society and allows you to get paid very。

 very well in addition to that that same focus can be used for things like brushing your teeth taking care of yourself eating healthy making sure that you use a condom when you have sex meeting a great girl whatever it is all those responsible things that you should be doing Now on the flip side you also have the art of appreciation which is great for the short term Mains right。

good at appreciating themselves they're good at appreciating themselves if they haven't taken a shower。

 if they have holes in their teeth， if they're on drugs and if everything's going wrong。

 they still appreciate themselves now we can look at that as bad。

But I look at that as something to model How are they doing it Well。

 the long term matr their brain is very much linear right very logical linear straight point A to point B。

 whereas the short trim matr， they're very free associative So see one skill set is like the Calal Newport the deep work whereasas the other skill set is almost like improv class floating around being present enjoying the moment。

 finding good things about yourself Now the major skill。

Is actually having cultivated both and having built synaptic pathways in between those two parts of your brain so that you can access both parts of them when you can do that。

 what you can do is you can go to work， hustle， make money and provide for you and your loved ones。

 an incredible life， but then when you go out that night。

 you can meet a growth in two seconds just like the artist， the surfer， the musician。The drug dealer。

The bartender， the promoter。The nurse is this random guy that lives on his mother's couch you can meet a girl go out sex with her because she sees that you've got that seductive type of energy that'll give her a lot of grandkids remember the girl has a dual mating tragedy she knows that she can have sex with the short termm guy but get it raised by long-term guy but what's really powerful is when you have both now what's crazy is this when you can actually cultivate that joyful fun side of yourself you can always flip around and suddenly say look I've got to go in the longterm girls love that that's like a fantasy for women is to tie down a guy and get into be responsible when he was seductive but it's very rarely a fantasy to take a nerd and turn him into a badass because it all just seems very try hard So what I want you to do is in your life cultivate that self-development ethic of getting things done of making things happen but I also want you not just to achieve but to appreciate to be in the moment and to enjoy allow your mind to float around and realize that women are very fluid they do not need a guy to have a shit together to hook。

With and you can actually just enjoy women， get in the moment with them。

 experience the beauty with them， F around with them， play around them， be playful。

 have fun and askacks all you want or ges three whatever it is that you want to do one night stands dirty something cans up whatever you you can do that and then you can also live a great life again don't fall into the trap that the short term guy does where he preserves his state at all costs rationalize that all costs avoids anything that takes him out of his flow but don't fall into the trap where you're constantlyline this logical grind and never in a flow and always waiting for some future time when you're gonna feel good because in truth。

 if you're always waiting for a future time to feel good when you finally get there。

 you have a synaptic pathway in your brain like a superhigh into in the future in the future then I'll feel good and you'll never feel good your girlfriend will be hooking up with other dos that are more fun than you she'll be miserable you'll never feel good is gonna suck。

But on the flip side， you also don't want to get to the point where you can't focus。

 You'll notice that when you're in a short term party ro out for a month。

 you can't focus when you get back because everything feels okay。Literally， like you go out tonight。

 you hook up in a threeson because you're a playful， everything feels okay， your brand says dude。

 you're winning， you're reproducing。The rockets are shooting us up， just keep doing that。

 your brain won't even let you focus。 your brain tricks you， do you see that because it says。

 hey he's getting laid from this。Keep going。But on the flip side if you're pushing that long term strategy like I'm getting ahead。

 keep going and your brain locks you in there in recognizing this you can see what your mind is doing to you and you can take control。

 cultivate both sides of yourself， the law school and the playful。

The point A to point B and the point A to point fucking infinity。やれた？

All right now I hope you're getting a sense that what we're talking about as far as deep focus combined with wild hilarity and craziness is what we always strive to embody in any video from real social dynamics and the reason why is you might see me doing a seminar and I'm getting onto to a deep point and then bam out of nowhere I just start going crazy start doing stupid shit you' thinking whyhy is he doing this the reason that I've emphasized this for many years is because the single hardest skill that I've ever learned in coaching was not sitting there coaching a guy breaking it down。

And not being crazy and picking up girls that was actually pretty easy Both of those were fairly easy like learn how to get girls laughing。

 get myself laughing that I learned many years ago。

Learning how to give information I learned many years ago。

 but learning how to coach while giving sustained focus on a student and then bas seeing a girl right there and switching gears that took me about a decade It was just really hard but funny enough。

The technique that I use is just doing it regularly， not having a limiting belief。

 I feel that what happens to us as guys is we get into a gear where we're very logical and we think we can't just break out and be playful but a lot of time if you just force your physiology you're just like。

How are you doing man， my name's Owen， my voice is almost gone it makes so sad。

But I'm a and you could literally just not have a limiting belief and say fuck it if you're in a serious mood。

 switch your mood and I try to embody this even when I'm working and I'm very very focused and then bam。

 I just break out and start laughing but also when I'm laughing。

 I want to be able to get serious and this took me years to do。

Back in the day students actually they always had pretty high expectations。

 which fair enough I want to meet those expectations and they'd be like。

 okay coach me and you know I'm gaming some girl I'm laughing Im having fun。

 I'm like dude just chill， we're having fun， stop breaking the fun。They're like coach me， I'm like。

 all right。I'll coach you。 I coach them right， and then I'll be coaching them for an hour and they go you do it。

 you pick up the girl。 I'm like dude， I'm in such a logical headspace from coaching you。

 I can't just go pick up the girl right now。 I try to imagine that right You've been coaching somebody。

You know， for like an hour straight and then he asks you to go game a girl when you're in this massively logical state Well youve probably felt that yourself when you're in this very logical state going about your life and then you want to start having fun I want to get even more outlandish because you want to practice that so we have to get to the point one key thing here is getting to the getting to the point where。

Nice to meet you Nice to meet you Come me my friend， Come here。It's right here， it's okay。

He just got it from New York what's up？How good。I'm such a good friend determining where she's going and then walk her there。

Okay。でばいねえよ。A large part of it is calming down a lot， like I'm still a bit jacked up。Mom。

How to find that inner Corey Worthington right remember though。

 that you don't have to be a cartoon character or a clown。

 a lot of time you can just be kind of chilling fun。 It's just really about appreciating the moment。

 So really the solution here is realizing that you want to appreciate the moment in all your life all the time stay in that pocket of a little bit silly a little bit playful and not taking life overly seriously But then at the same time don't get so silly that you can't focus at all or rather allow yourself to go to the extreme and then when you want to bring it back。

 bring it back but that they are funny enough， that's the major thing that I've tried to incorporate in every video from RSD and the major thing that I've tried to incorporate into my teaching in the field I'm very proud it was just something that was hard to learn So that being the case again like I said。

 why do we do this because in the long term you want to build through moving forward you're never satisfied。

 you're never enough and you know that someday when you get the perfect shape and the perfect finances then you'll get a girl motivates you。

 you're unsatis。Butut on the flip side， you're completely satisfied， you're having fun。

 living in the moment out here in the desert after three days out rocket it in the dry air I guess it's not fun。

Ohly shit， I would like a owe it。I was the whole of hugs。I have so。Yeah。あ。

Don't lose your friend What's that Don't lose your friend You're bossy No friends are the most important things you have You're bossy it't good to work out Okay。

 there could only be one boss in this relationship It's not you It's on me Okay it's yourl twil you empty shy twirl out of this relationship Are you're ready swirling。

ITo be a doctor though， so I can be cocky What do they teach you in medical school？

They teach you tono take people seriously， you know what how would do use？

I feel you as six babies you never get to be a doctor and all your dreams that we shattered to not enough。

🎼I我。Okay， so at this point， I hope that I've satisfied you that you don't need to be a good provider to get a girl right like women love a good provider that's a fucking urban legend of epic proportion now I want you to understand that girls go down to places like Cancunves spring break and they are down there to get laid to party to hook up with guys and to have fun and women essentially put men into two different categories the fun guy to have orgies with to make out with each other with okay like literally they get to order around these guys they start making out with each other and then they've got the safe guy the trustworthy guy the guy that you know when they're getting to be around 30 they want to meet up with。

Which guy you want to be， dude， really bro， you want to be the kind of guy we're like， you know。

 she's out like hooking up with dude's and having fun all through her prime years and right when the party's about to end when the magic school bus that she's on as a bus going through a rainbow whatever it was hi Susie hi Suie hi flying through the planets。

 she goes through the magic school bus and at the end of the magic school bus when the ride's over。

 you're there waiting no， dude you want to be out there having fun with girls in their prime kicking ass rock in it。

 having sex， enjoying life Women like a good provider shut the fuck up I did that hat。

 the first thing that I tried was getting my own house at age 21 that I owned going to a top school in Canada running a business。

 having cash I even got in shape and funny enough， all those things to be this perfect intellectual provider repelled women and repulse them and discusses them。

Because flat out， it came across as compensation。 get into the moment， have fun。

 party with the girls， enjoy the girls， rock， the girls don't judge the girls。

 don't buy a bullshit narrative that shows that you failed a societal shit test It is a shit test a test of your intelligence given to you by all of society don't argue with it。

 don't get into some big debate over it。 You're gonna lose that debate。 The guys that get it。

 they're like， hey I'm just having fun， I'm looking for the right girl。

 I believe in love that's how they answer， they don't sit there debating it getting into a pickup artist debate versus like mainstream philosophy the debate they just go out。

 get laid and enjoy women I want you to be that guy where women when they see you。

 they say you're awesome。 you're amazing， you have great energy。 I love you call me。

 want you to call me I want to kiss you I grew can live in Hollywood。Do you ever visit？いや。哎你。

I go to Disney， are you going to come visit me？You're texting me， text me。いや。

I really like it is everyone like this in Hollywood because they？I love you。ing， I like it。

I'll text you。You do too What did you guys notice the commonality out of any girl who wanted my number tonight。

 what's the commonality that you're seeing what are some things you're saying and what's their enthusiasm level when I get the number typicallyy what I see is very high if you watch the video of it like I'm like you want me to call they're like yes。

 yes or they go I love your energy you have amazing energy and you'll see this get it again text me。

Yeah。Okay love I love you too that should be happening right off the bat and that doesn't happen from being a great provider longterm strategist your happiness comes from that with women emotional emotions go up from a guy that's chill fun playful in the moment and seductive that being the case don't buy into this fucking bullsh that that part of your mind that's really meant to build a great life for and family has anything to do with what she's responding to she takes it as a great bonus it handy when she gets age where that's she's for but fundamentally is something you do for yourself never ever up the best dude yesterday out like should make you remember him's like I share Why is he doing that impress me I guessly because he's in complete abundance doesn't give who's making out who super。

He could just like throw away hello there how are you doing Oh I'm going to put on my tie what do you think oh annesia yes I'm baby Jesus in the manja how are you doing today。

 pleasure to meet you in life people have an adventure self and a conservative self these are actually different personality matrices that exist up in a person's head。

The adventure self craves new stimulation， new experience， and nothing is a big deal。

 The conservative self wants stability and guarantees Which persona are you stimulating to the surface in that woman。

 The adventureous self or the conservative self。 What kind of personality matrix are you accessing inner for the guy who stimulating the adventureventous self。

 sex is not a big deal。 you get the no big deal card。

 you get a pass for the guy who stimulating the conservative self。

 Everything's a big deal is gonna take a long time。 Not even how I dress， I wear a silly beard。

 I try to dress with power with nice clothes， but things that are silly and a little bit outlandish because I want that girl to know that everything about me。

 it's sharp。 it's strong is powerful， It's dominant， but at the same time， nothing's a big deal。

 Everything's a big joke。 Everything's fun。 Everything's on the up and up。

 everything's new experiences and that being the case。 you get the pass。

 the player pass the exception because you're the guy who stimulates her adventureventous self and for you。

 nothing is that big of a deal。 you guys all want to come get tacos。😡，taco， tacos， tacos。

 tacos tacos come come's we're back in Old town Scottsdale。

 probably gonna grab breakfast go to bed and finish out the video tonight。

 but a quick last segment on the idea of categories and how girls are not the only ones with categories up in their heads。

 we all have it and we're all irrational about it So let's just say that you're looking at a table and you get a nice table from Ikea which you're gonna bring back to your home in Connecticut now maybe that table is like 200 bucks。

 300 bucks but you're gonna really straight yourself to think about it and think about it very logically so that you have the perfect table that you're gonna keep forever back at your home in Connecticut。

But then all of a sudden you know， you go down to Las Vegas and that Vegas table is like hundreds of dollars and you don't even get to keep the table。

 you just get it for one night， 10 times a price， one night。

 and yet do you negotiate and think about it like you did with the table in Connecticut。

 absolutely not because for an experience we don't negotiate anything that is a commodity。

 we negotiate right so the provider guy。The long term guy， he's more of a commodity。

 but the guy who provides an experience， he's just fun。

 I've seen it many times with many of my wealthy friends where they will negotiate。

All sorts of different things down to every last dollar but then there's other things that they'll have in life where they don't just no questions asked boom they want it and usually it's some type of unique experience。

 the same guy who will negotiate over every last penny with everything that he buys might go to an NBA championship game and oh my God it's the NBA championship it's an experience and he doesn't negotiate So that being the case。

 you got to ask yourself what kind of guy are you or the kind of guy with the girls is gonna to negotiate with you and make you pay a premium or you're you that fun experience where all the rule book gets thrown out and she just wants to have an amazing time ultimately women worship at the altar of fun and what that means is that girls will let anything pass by as long as just for fun right like I can have a pop belly He's like well he just likes to eat he likes to have fun but if it's kind of serious they criticize you for it or you go to kiss a girl and if it's just for fun。

 she's like kiss that means just having fun but if it's a serious thing whoa whoa what are you doing Mr for how dare you you can say you guys should kiss。

If it's just a joke， it's just for fun， they love it， they'll kiss each other。

But if you were to say that in a serious environment， the like。

 what the fuck you're doing are you're some kind of fucking pervert。

 it's a complete double standard because of the different types of categories that we have in our minds。

 women ultimately。We'll put a guy into that category and you want to be that man for whom they want to make an exception。

 you want to be that man with whom they just want to have a massive， massive amount of fun。

That being the case moving forward， ask yourself， am I commodity to women or am I an experience to women am I framing myself as someone to negotiate with or am I framing myself as someone to have an amazing experience with just say you're an old bald man you're not old or look I'm balding had to have manmbos touch them how old are you？

Well you look very young Hi am， how old are you How you think2？

Thank you I love your bald I love your bald love I want to take and to take you're like what does she saying all right so we're gonna wrap up here in Tempe and I want to leave you some ideas about the importance of being financially successful healthy responsible having integrity and creating a life that you absolutely love now this is very important because I think for a lot of guys deep down we really want to do for the girls I think that men are by far the more romantic sex I think that we want romance I think we want to connect somebody I think as a man we kind of feel lonely and like we haven't met our other half and we have this dream that someday she's gonna come around So on some level as a you're building this beautiful nest for a woman who's going really appreciate it and there's sort of a sense of justice or righteousness if a girl。

Would appreciate all that hard labor and work that you did to build an incredible life for her now when you see examples of girls。

 you know， hooking up with guys and doing double makeouts and orgies and going home with guys that just met and all this kind of thing。

And these guys have done nothing to earn it。It could be very， very depressing。

 it could be very shocking to the system， you could lose sleep over it， it can fuck you up。

And believe me， I understand that completely， I went through that myself。So at that point。

 you have to ask yourself。Why are you doing it？And what I want to do here is actually， again。

 really look at that。And give you a more positive outlook on this。

 and here's really what it is Financially， having money is about you and your happiness。

It's about you traveling the world， it's about you being able to afford to educate yourself。

 it's about you being able to afford getting high quality foods so that you can live a long life and be healthy。

Finances are about you and your children， finances are about being able to provide your children with an incredible life。

Finance provide a feeling of safety， a feeling of comfort。

 the ability to live where you want to live and do what you want to do money is not the root of all evil。

 no money。Oftentimes， poverty， scarcity。Is the root of illness， lack of education。

Depressing situations。So go make money， you don't need to just do it for her。

You can do it for you and your future family。Likewise， health， why should you be healthy。

 why should you go to the gym？Going to the gym is not about vanity。

It's not about living up to an ideal to magazine。You don't need to， you don't need that to get late。

 I promise you。I promise you。You do it because。It improves your hormones。

Actually balances your hormones， it makes your brain work better。

 it' proof that there's proof that when you work out。Your brain actually gets sharper。

Serotonin dopamine， a silicon and Gaba， they balance it makes you more intelligent and aware and mentally stronger when you work out。

 it increases bone density so that if you fall in the shower when you're an old man。

You're not going to have to get a hip replacement right away or smash your bones apart。

It teaches mental discipline。It teaches focus， it teaches a mind muscle connection Many people believe that the mind is the body。

 the body is the mind， I think it was Elliot Holse or might have heard that。

 and you can see people who have a strong body oftentimes match that up with a strong mind。

It's about mobility and jumping around， having fun， being a kid。

 living a long life and having vitality。Working it out means you're going to be able to have sex longer。

You can add more sex， higher quality sex。You're not going to need to be pumping down。

Penis pills that keep you erect。Le you want to。A lot of my friends do， but you。

 you don't have to do that。So there's many， many reasons。To stay healthy that are for your。Happiness。

Now how about your integrity or sticking to your values， why is that important？

Do you need that to get laid， you don't， I promise you， pieces of shit get laid every day。

There's dirt bags pulling fucking girls right now while you're watching this。Are they winning？

Or are they losing out？Some guy who uses drugs to get laid。

Because girlss want to home with the party boy， right， is he winning or is he losing out？

What does integrity mean？I don't like to use words like integrity because I feel like everybody lacks integrity at times。

It's kind of judgmental， but it's an ideal that we can aspire to， so integrity is for you。

It shows that you're an entity that will live up to your promises。

 and that means that other people can come and work with you and do things with you。

Integrity is everything if you want to accomplish anything great with other people。

How about living to your values？That gives your life meaning。It gives you hope。

It gives you purpose and that purpose is like what keeps you moving forward like a fish and water。

There is so much more than just getting laid with hot girls and doing it for women。

So you don't need to do these things for women。You do these things for you your future life partner may leave you for a fucking dirt bag It could happen and I'd love to give you a story that would say it will never happen but I don't know about that there's guys out there that make get laid more than you bi partying harder than you this is probably a massive change in paradigm because your entire life you've been building this perfect package for a girl who is someday appreciate it you've been creating this perfect nest or at least moving towards it so that someday when you meet a girl who appreciates all that you have to offer you could finally be complete Well the funny thing is in a way of looking at it。

 it's actually better than what you thought because the truth is girls don't need that girls are very fluid。

 they're very pliable， they know how to go at the flow if girls in Vegas and all the friends having sex。

 they have sex if they're in a Christian environment that's very conservative and nobody's having sex。

 she'll say that she doesn't want to have sex whatever it is that's going on she'll find a way to love it and what's cool about girls is they'll really believe it now as a man。

 if you are the complete package you had a relationship and the entire relationship all that she would do is go on and on about how you're her perfect partner。

😡，Eventually you might break up and she starts dating some scumumbag and it confusedfuse a fuck out of you becauseuse you're like how could she be dating him after everything that she said that she loves about me right and it doesn't mean that she wasn't sincere at the time but what it means was that in the moment she loved what you brought to the table because she's fluid and now that her circumstances change she loved something else look here's a cool part about that。

As a man， this teaches you to do these great things for your own approval， not for somebody else。

 because in many ways by trying to create this perfect persona or this perfectness for a woman to appreciate it。

 you're doing it out of the desire for approval instead of doing it for the most important person who will always be with you along your entire spiritual journey yourself so that being the case。

 of course you want to give but you want to give without any expectation of anything in return if you build a great life and you give it。

 you give it for the joy of giving it but ultimately you have to realize that girls are fluid。

 they can like anything and you have to find your own reasons for living a great life I'm sorry that the world isn't this perfect just place where you know you do the right thing and everything works out that's not true if you look at that historically it's not true。

But at the same time。When you do these things， it gives you a chance to have a better life。

So be okay with the fact。That women aren't God。That women aren't these perfect rewarders of good deeds。

Except the fact that you yourself don't always pick up the kale juice， the juice kale。

 sometimes you pick up the fucking Coca Cola。And you gule it down you like it and girls are no different than you。

 they're just doing their best。I know that you can find a middle ground on this。

 I know that you don't need to execute binary thinking and that you can find other ways to think about this that work for you。

 so many guys get depressed when they see this kind of thing。

 but in my mind it's really about the middle ground。For mild success of women。

What am I looking for what I want to do， I want to be that guy who has the long term mating strategy today day。

Every day I work hard towards my goals， that's for me。That's my fun， that's about my life。

I don't need to use women to motivate myself to do the right thing。And then at the same time。

 at nighttime， I want to go have fun， I want to have a ball， I want a party。

 I want to go fucking crazy。And the girls love it。And the way that I ultimately think about it。

And this is a single most important thing for me。Is that women's real role？Rather than being this。

Barbiter。Of living a perfect provider male life and rewarding you for that。Instead。

 I like to think of women as these angels that have been brought here to make us have fun。

Because imagine if girls didn't exist， would you ever dance， would you have swagger。

 would you have flow， would you have fun？What would you do？You want to know something。

 I think my life would be really fucking boring。I think that if it weren't for women。

 what would wind up happening is I'd be like Mr。 Spock logical all the time， women taught me rhythm。

 flow， sexuality， softness。I wouldn't be wearing this， I wouldn't have this if it weren't for girls。

 I'd be wearing probably a garbage bag。Wking around naked might be cool actually， who knows， right？

The arts come from women， expression comes from women。Joy。

 women stimulate this out of us so rather than thinking of girls。

As having some mission to get us to be this perfect provider meal and work like a little ant around the clock until we're dead。

To provide for them some kind of nest that we think will be this perfect package for them。

Realize that you yourself don't always pick the perfect thing for you。

 sometimes you pick the emotional thing， sometimes you pick the thing that makes no sense just because you want to and women do it to allow it for them。

😡，Instead， allow women to offer you the gift of getting you to have more fucking fun， to laugh。

 to play， to go out， to go crazy， to go wild， and to get in touch with a more primitive side of yourself。

That element of you that I call a short term mating strategy。

 it is a more primitive primal aspect of yourself that if it weren't for women you'd have no motivation to get in touch with so rather than walking around trying to be this perfect guy saying I'm going to。

Be the perfect provider。Instead， be a provider for your own reasons。

 be a good man for your own reasons and allow women to pull a primal primitive fun， exciting。

 exuberant side out of you that you get to bring out whenever you want that is how I personally have resolved all this and for me I just enjoy living my life building it up doing the right thing for myself。

If a girl happens to enjoy it， that's great， but ultimately it's for me and that wild crazy side is a gift that's brought out of me and stimulated。

To engage yourself by women。Anyway， I hope that you got some good value out of this。

 I hope that you will find both sides yourself and not identify with one or the other because the ultimate skill set as I said。

 is being able to connect the two Anyway， at a wonderful evening sharing this with you I'm off to bed。

And I'll talk to you soon。Peace。
