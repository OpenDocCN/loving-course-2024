 it's like you told a funny joke„ÄÇWhen you make them laugh repeatedlyÔºå they think you're a funny guy„ÄÇ

As an adult humanÔºå no one is responsible for your emotional state except you„ÄÇ

You should be able to generate your own good emotions and share them with the woman„ÄÇ

Failure to do so makes you irrelevant„ÄÇOr even a spoiler of other people's fun„ÄÇ

üéºThe Ben„ÄÇOr even a humiliating„ÄÇNobody knows better than I do about humiliation on the club the first 18 months I was coin out„ÄÇ

 we were doing all the crazy shit with that was in that old book The Game„ÄÇWe had hours and hoursÔºå 30„ÄÇ

 40 hours of canned routinesÔºå tanned remarks„ÄÇThe thing that worked well about this isÔºå well„ÄÇ

 we were knocking on more doors when we're talking to more girls„ÄÇBiging in more leads„ÄÇ

And that led to more that„ÄÇHoweverÔºå after you're using all these canned routines and contrived stories you get women in our bed„ÄÇ

It became very apparent and very quickly that spending time with these women were just not satisfying„ÄÇ

Evenn weren hanging out with me because I was me„ÄÇThey were hanging out with me because of the caricature I was presented„ÄÇ

And to a movieÔºå maybe that sounds good„ÄÇOh wowÔºå well at least I'm getting more sex„ÄÇ

 however after the girl hung out with him for a short period of time„ÄÇ

 youd never see them around againÔºå two or three days at most„ÄÇ

Gomen don't like to feel like they've been tricked or manipulated into something„ÄÇ

They want to be with a man who acts like a man all the time„ÄÇ

 they want to be with someone knows who he isÔºå who knows what he wantsÔºå who's a strong leader„ÄÇ

creates compelling adventuretures but you can just have a lot of fun and be yourself selfish„ÄÇ

I entirely gave up that routine bass game„ÄÇBecause I only wanted to be with women wanted me for me„ÄÇ

These are the only type of relationships that are going to be long term sustainable„ÄÇ

We immensely fulfilling over any real period of time„ÄÇIf you need short term sexÔºå go by a prostitute„ÄÇ

 I guessÔºå man„ÄÇIf you want quality relationshipsÔºå there's no better way than this„ÄÇ

In the area of fun in the clubÔºå your ego is not your friend„ÄÇ

 your ego wants to protect your little self image from being rough up a bit„ÄÇ

 your ego may be the major roadblock to your actual success if you allow it„ÄÇ

Don't let your short term you go at emotionssÔºå keep you from accomplishing your long term goal„ÄÇ

You have no control over the perceptions of some other human's mind„ÄÇVery little control at that„ÄÇ

AgainÔºå don't worry about being an excellent manipulatorÔºå worry about being an excellent man„ÄÇ

 then scream through the muck and find the woman that's right for you„ÄÇBut for now back to your ego„ÄÇ

When you're rewarding yourself for taking action„ÄÇThat you know will lead to the long term accomplishment of your goals„ÄÇ

You're on the right trip and you're building self esteing„ÄÇ

You're engaging in a behavior that's going to lead„ÄÇ

Just get in front of themÔºå keep your mind„ÄÇLet let themselves you because type of woman„ÄÇ

You should want to be„ÄÇB's way to have fun in the back chest„ÄÇ

Simply talk about the things that you think are fun or funny„ÄÇ

Get her mirror neuron response operating in York favorverÔºå in not technical terms„ÄÇ

Neuron neurouron response simply means„ÄÇüéºIfYou are having sincere fun in the presence of others„ÄÇ

 their emotional state will tend to drift to be closer to yours„ÄÇ

People are easily convinced to join the fun of others„ÄÇThusÔºå your sincere happiness„ÄÇ

 light heartednessÔºå et cetera literally becomes the catalyst for others around you to start feeling the same way„ÄÇ

üéºAgainÔºå this is a primary precursor to intimate behavior„ÄÇ Have fun„ÄÇ

Build a connection to legitimize the experience„ÄÇ lead the girl„ÄÇ

And sex is a natural thing that happens„ÄÇMorere on this topic in my exclusive 10 Commandments of game interview with Tyler„ÄÇ

If you can maintain your sincerely good emotions longer than she can be suspect that you might be some beggar or creep„ÄÇ

 she will often choose to follow your emotional lead and become happy to spend time with you„ÄÇ

For one of by early proteges and gameÔºå this was exactly his strongest attribute„ÄÇ

You would basically just get in front of a pretty girl„ÄÇAnd to over share about how awesome he is„ÄÇ

Until she either walked away from disinterest and to confusion„ÄÇ

Work got excited about him and started to oversshare about her own life as well„ÄÇ

 Then he would lead the girlÔºå have a couple drinks and take her home„ÄÇGet this all the time„ÄÇ

A cultural noteÔºå be aware that a lot of humorÔºå a lot of things that inspire laughter in others„ÄÇ

Perpeicated on harsh truths about the human condition„ÄÇNot some fairy tail shit„ÄÇ

Sometimes these are the kind of truths that would make someone want to laugh or cry„ÄÇ

 depending how close this topic was to their personal experience in life„ÄÇIt's not my goal„ÄÇ

 nor could it be yours to meet people try it for your own amusement„ÄÇThat's just call being a po man„ÄÇ

HoweverÔºå don't filter your sincere sense of humor around strangers„ÄÇ

Just like not everyone is going to share your goals and values„ÄÇ

 but everyone is going to have fun the same way you do or share your sense of humor„ÄÇ

Be a fixed end adult when someone touches in a sensitive area in your life„ÄÇ

Pive by example on this metric„ÄÇThere shouldn't be anything a stranger could say to you that would make you cry„ÄÇ

This isn't an outlandish standard to hold other humans to as well„ÄÇ

Do you really want to be spending time around people who are that sensitive or emotionalÔºü

Send them back to their facepae for cry and color together with the other adult infants„ÄÇ

Then get back on track„ÄÇIn exampleÔºå I really enjoy a lot of irreverence to political correctness and trash humor„ÄÇ

I've enjoyed this juvenile sense of humor well since I was a juvenile„ÄÇOccasionally„ÄÇ

 someone is sincerely offended by it„ÄÇI don't mind at all when this happened„ÄÇ

Just let me know they're not someone I should be spending my time with„ÄÇYou don't value your time„ÄÇ

 you don't value your life„ÄÇI often delight in making fun of others in the environment„ÄÇAgain„ÄÇ

Many are excited to indulge a few aren't„ÄÇBut political correctness is the opposite of true self expression„ÄÇ

 and although it might serve a purpose in corporate culture„ÄÇ

You should leave it there and communicate to the core of a human's emotions„ÄÇ

No one takes action without sufficient physical or emotional arousal„ÄÇ

Boring them to death is not an effective strategy„ÄÇWhile weigh them with your ade expectlessness of political correctness isn't going to do shit except bore someone to doubt„ÄÇ

 it's not going to make them fuck you„ÄÇI often think of the show Game of Thrones as a fine guiding light of what people are actually emotionally responsive to„ÄÇ

Every episode contains a new warrant justiceÔºå a violation of social norms for some form of atrocity„ÄÇ

It's also the most watched TV show ever created„ÄÇIncestÔºå deÔºå torture and genocide„ÄÇ

 that's emotional relevant„ÄÇAnd you can have a lighthearted and fun time getting into the core of the most brutal or taboo topics of the human condition„ÄÇ

How you've got people's attention„ÄÇWhen my friends and I go up together we're so damn curefree and laugh so hard„ÄÇ

 oftentimes men and women in the environment start looking at us„ÄÇSome of them are jealous„ÄÇ

 some of them are annoyedÔºå yet irreverence towards the judgment of others combined with our heightened positive emotions is a special sauce that lets others in the environment know you have abundance in their high value people„ÄÇ

Pres through inec people would never be able to tolerate this much of social pressure while still being in the moment without being extremely drunk„ÄÇ

When they see we're soberÔºå or at least relatively soberÔºå we're having so much fun„ÄÇ

 it just can naturally attractive„ÄÇHaators will look at you funny and perhaps touch you negatively„ÄÇ

 but there's no more sincere indicator to others that your life is in better order than theirs that they should wish to know you„ÄÇ

Realize the second most common reason in humans laugh or a smile is a deferment of social status„ÄÇ

YeahÔºå I know you think to yourselfÔºåDrekÔºå now you're getting buried of the way„ÄÇForget this man„ÄÇ

 the most common example of this is like an employee laughing at his boss's choke„ÄÇ

 even though the shit wasn't that funny in an nightclub situation„ÄÇ

 this conveyance to status is well as exemplified and a woman tells you a joke that you don't think it's funny„ÄÇ

Instead of laughing instead of engaging a social department and releasing the tension„ÄÇ

Just look they' in the eye and hold that eye contact instead of glass„ÄÇ

Put the circle factor on her to laugh instead„ÄÇIn a way that she knows that you didn't get the punch line„ÄÇ

 you don't think her shit was funny„ÄÇThat little sense of her being judged by„ÄÇ

 really spikes her emotionsÔºå really captures her attention„ÄÇBe cautious with this however„ÄÇ

 if done wellÔºå I'll feel a bit conscientious and defer to you to keep your attention„ÄÇ

When done in the wrong contextÔºå you just look autistic„ÄÇ

Passing shit tests is another great time to implement this strategy of saying nothing„ÄÇ

Just holding eye contactÔºå maybe raising an eyebrow a bit„ÄÇ

 basically looking at her as if she said something to you„ÄÇ

 that was so disjointed from your reality or her worldview that you found it entirely bizarre and unrelatable as if she ask you if you've ever had sex with a squid passing these so-called shit tests or congruence test„ÄÇ

 by the wayÔºå it's oftentimes a great spot to interject humor in the interaction and really amp up her attraction for you„ÄÇ

When she jokingly pushes an identity upon youÔºå the most wouldn't find attractive or flattering„ÄÇ

 this is a fantastic time to simply agree with her„ÄÇ

 and then escalate whatever she' said and make it even more preposterous„ÄÇ

This is based on an improv principle of yes and„ÄÇIn the art of improv„ÄÇ

 people don't argue with each otherÔºå you don't contradict your partner on stage„ÄÇ

Whatever they say to youÔºå or' just likeÔºå yes and furthermore„ÄÇYesÔºå Anne„ÄÇ

 you accept what ever has been said is just a given fact„ÄÇ

Then you escalate it or morph it into something else„ÄÇ

In the context of a girl busting your balls in the clubÔºå she insinuates that you have a small cock„ÄÇ

 just agree and exaggerate the smallness of it„ÄÇColorÔºå it's about the size of your thumb„ÄÇKNo„ÄÇ

 about the size of her thumb„ÄÇKlllor about a study you read recently about small penises by nationality„ÄÇ

Kelly were shocked to find out about the extent of your physical inadequacy in this area after two years of therapy„ÄÇ

 your counselor told you you'd feel better off instead of thinking about itÔºåAs an inch and a half„ÄÇ

 you instead round it off and thought to yourself nearly two inchesÔºå nearly two inches„ÄÇ

 then just change the subject„ÄÇYou don't want to have like a 15 minute conversation about how small your dick is good„ÄÇ

Just accept whatever she saidÔºå descalate it further and make it more preposterous„ÄÇ

 have a chuckle togetherÔºå change the subject„ÄÇAnother point„ÄÇ

Make sure you're not just being some entertainer showed in the club„ÄÇ

I been doing own fun and getting her emotionally excited to join„ÄÇ

This very different concept in entertaining her like a fucking clown or a court jer„ÄÇ

Do it's fun for you and don't give a damn about her reaction or immediate feedback„ÄÇ

When you're ping off her for feedbackÔºå you're no longer having your own funds„ÄÇ

 youve crossed into the realm of seeking validation„ÄÇOnly feedback you need from the girl is„ÄÇ

 is she still standing in there or is she gone awayÔºüShe's still there„ÄÇ

 she's still un't minded about moving things forward to hear the right kind of demand for her„ÄÇ

She just needs some more information to see if it makes sense for her life„ÄÇ

Don't overcomplicate this commandmentÔºå just generate your own fund in the general presence of Hckman„ÄÇ

Pull them into whatever you and your friends you're joining and invite her along for the adventure„ÄÇ

She doesn't opt out along the way„ÄÇThe adventure leaves to your bedroom„ÄÇ

Here's a fun story that happened with one of my buddies and I were out„ÄÇ

My friend and I were in a big city nightclub and saw a couple of really pretty girls standing near a bar„ÄÇ

 so we came over and chatted up the girls„ÄÇYou're just cling around and talking the lot of shit„ÄÇ

 really got excited about us quickly„ÄÇSo here's the four of us„ÄÇJust fucking off„ÄÇ

 laughing about nothingÔºå have no idea what the hell we were talking about if we're just having a great time„ÄÇ

 just a lot of self expression„ÄÇA lot of non judgment and a lot of fucking fun„ÄÇ

And then these fucking two tros turn around and they bang over drinks„ÄÇWell„ÄÇ

 I guess these guys were at the bar ahead of timeÔºå like the girls have met them just recently and the two guys are waiting at the bar are getting drinks for themselves and the girls„ÄÇ

So the dudes come backÔºå camp the drinks for the girls„ÄÇIn factial is like you know„ÄÇ

 sorry guys there with us„ÄÇAnd we totally get the idea like you see the girls who having like way less fun now and they're just like„ÄÇ

hÔºå whateverÔºå but it's awkward because the guy's just bought some pinks„ÄÇSo I each over„ÄÇ

 I put my hand on both of the girls' drinks take them from the girls„ÄÇPass one to my buddy„ÄÇ

 I grabbed my girl by the hand and I started to walk away with her„ÄÇ

 my buddy grabbed the elder one and followed„ÄÇüéºWe moved them about 20 feet away and just continued to party so sure they felt a little awkward or a little office tragedy but they're really excited for the adventure they loved ourdiaccity and they very readily just followed us along so these two dudes they have a little conference with each other„ÄÇ

Now mind youÔºå my friend and I were just in like some jeans some cool shoes„ÄÇ

 probably a t-shirt and a jacket I really don't remember so we're dressed very casually we're just fucking clowning when a great time These only you could do is they're dressed up in like formal suits and ties in the club They're just young guys they're like 30 or something„ÄÇ

So they come overÔºå they're going to make their big intervention and take the girls that thing„ÄÇ

So they come over and likeÔºå sureÔºå these girls are with us and I'll have you know theyre both Harvard graduates and we're investment bankers„ÄÇ

And they tried to get the girls to fucking roll with„ÄÇAnd my buddy and I just pounded them just like„ÄÇ

 you knowÔºå awesomeÔºå bro fucking nice tie I dudeÔºå da da da daÔºå just old school aO shit„ÄÇ

 just fucking clowning themÔºå justing themÔºå fucking pick the girls up„ÄÇ

 literally walk away with her in my heart„ÄÇSo those guys are fucking deadÔºå they're done„ÄÇ

I don't know what happened maybe they drowned themselves even their fucking gos their spirit is still floating around the club„ÄÇ

 crying into its own hand and masturbating with fearsÔºå I don't know what the fuck happened„ÄÇ

 but I know what happened with the girls they came home with my buddy and I had fucking amazing night together it stayed till morning„ÄÇ

Fhy guys get caught up with I shared aboutÔºå ohÔºå how do I deal with the other guy„ÄÇ

 other guy come into myselfÔºüüéºT this really barely happens„ÄÇ

 The two things that allow this to happen in your interactions are either you're standing way too far away from the girl and strange dudes don't see that you have an intimate relationship together„ÄÇ

 that you're sharing intimacy and your fucking close and excited and engaged to be with each other„ÄÇ

 or you're boring and the poorÔºå fucking girl to death„ÄÇ

 An ape that looks at her can just see the fucking look on her face is like„ÄÇ

She's not having a great time„ÄÇShe's clearly not accomplishing her goal of having fun in the environment and she'd be pretty receptive of a fun guy coming in there„ÄÇ

 taking her on a fucking exciting adventure instead of fucking boring or like a fucking do Look man„ÄÇ

 not everybody's going to think the shit that you think is fun or funnyÔºå is fun or funny„ÄÇ

But the more you're generating your own funÔºå the more you are the source of your own good emotions„ÄÇ

 as shit transfers and to othersÔºå it's can be way easier for you to lead the girls„ÄÇ

 way easier for them to want to come join your party man and talk about this more in Commandment  seven„ÄÇ

Here are some exercises to help implement this commandment„ÄÇ

Watch a variety of stand up comics and see what elements of their humor resonates with you and talk about the topics unfiltered in the environment„ÄÇ

YesÔºå unfiltered if you never offend someone„ÄÇYou've also failed to delight many others who have loved your company„ÄÇ

AlsoÔºå when you come across something and funny you during your normal life this week„ÄÇ

 make a point to write that shit down in your phone if you just made a couple bullet pointss in your phone like shit that made you laugh this week„ÄÇ

And you kept that up for just a very short period of time for 20 or 30 things in your phone that when you go to the club„ÄÇ

 you're going to glance at those and you just have callback humor of like you know oh shit yeah„ÄÇ

 oh that and you have a little chuckle and it just gets you in the right spirit getting the right mood to access the part of your brain that's relaxed„ÄÇ

 fun and funny to convey those high value of behaviors of displaying irreverent humor having more fun than the other people in the environment„ÄÇ

AgainÔºå there's probably no better indicator of who feels sincere abundance and who has the best life„ÄÇ

And just their ability to relaxÔºå kick backÔºå and that fun of an environment„ÄÇThat's why everybody came„ÄÇ

 fun is the currency of the club„ÄÇBook recommendations for more on this topic„ÄÇ
