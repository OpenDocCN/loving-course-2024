# RSD《诱惑开悟》：《诱惑之道》第三节 爱情之道_ev

🎼What is love。Can anyone really answer that question？If you are in love。

What is it that you're in love with her？Or the idea of her。Her goodness。

Or your perception of goodness。Do you love her for her and all her beauty？

Or do you love her because of what she does for you？As we know， love masssras as many things。

But is there such a thing as true lasting love？I'll tell you what。

I'll define love and you think about whether or not you agree。Okay， here goes。

Love is that feeling you get。When you meet the right girl。Do you agree？

Is love really a pleasant sensation that magically and spontaneously generates when she appears？

You know， butterflies in the stomach， that euphoric loss of sensibility。

 that exquisite madness that takes over all our senses。If that's real and love is a feeling。🎼Then。

 true love。Is new law。The problem with this notion that love is the way someone makes us feel。

Is that a feeling comes？And a feeling may go。But this is how most of us approach a relationship we get together and make all kinds of long term promises。

To each other。🎼Because of a feeling。Now it's true that this feeling is one of the most exhilarating and exciting feelings you can ever experience in life。

In fact， the intensity of our feelings and attraction for each other is usually construed as proof of the intensity of our love。

 how true it is。I really， really like her， I'm in love with her。It must be true love。

If you let a girl know that you like her， it is very direct and very unusual。And frankly。

 it's quite refreshing for her。She will usually ask you something like。

Why do you say you like me so much you just met me and you don't know anything about me？

When that happens。Say， I don't know。I'm trying to figure that out for myself。

 I don't know what it is about you have lots of girlfriends。I just can't keep my eyes on you。

I know I can't give you what you want and deserve。That I can。

All I know is that I feel better when you're around。

And so we set out together arm and arm with high hopes。

 feeling so much love and euphoria for each other， for the newness of it all， delirious。

 crazily in love with each other， and it's good。But inevitably life。As life does， bears down on us。

And the miracle of love。Slowly fades as disappointments， routine and boredom。🎼Be to encroach。

🎼Eventually。We might even feel that the magic just isn't there anymore。

We know this is true because everywhere we look， we see broken marriages， broken hearts。

 broken dreams。Every single one of those broken relationships began， just like I described。

They thought this time would be different， this was the wine。Intentionions are still noble。

 dreams are still dreaming。Happily ever after is still the story we all still desire。

It's amazing how regularly our relationships crash on the rocks。 In fact。

 can you imagine any other enterprise of humanity that is undertaken with such spectacular optimism？

If we fail as regularly in business as we do in love， we would stand back， shake our head and say。

Okay， something's not working。But in affairs of the heart。

 we repeat the same cycles over and over again。It's because we think we know what we want。U men。

 you know， we see a guy who is rich or famous with a hot girl in his arm。And we think。

 I want one of those。That's what I want。Well there are plenty of rich。

 successful men in this world with a trophy girl on their arm。

 a girl who pretends that she likes him。But she really only tolerates him。Or worse， can't stand it？

Yeah， a guy like that might have a hot babe。But he is missing something fundamental。

 something he desperately craves。And he knows it。He knows he's missing something。And it hurts him。

This is because we convince ourselves that when we finally have a girl like that in our life。

Our vision of the perfect woman。We will be had over heels in love。Then finally。We will be happy。

Then we would stay with that girl forever once we land her。Then we will marry that one。🎼Then。

🎼We will be in love。And why wouldn't we be？We have the girl we have always dreamed about。

This is what we think love is。We think that we want that special someone， that perfect someone。

 that ideal。TheOh， so elusive woman。A woman whose physical qualities we like， a woman who is sexy。

 killer her body， great and bad， a cover girl。You we look in a magazine at one of those pristine girls。

 airbrshed to an almost surreal perfection and we say， wow， I want one of those to my birthday。

Then I'll be happy。Then finally， I'll be happy。But the truth is。And this is going to sound strange。

 and you might even disagree。The truth is。We don't really want that at all。

That will not make us happy。Well， then what do we mean when we talk of love。

 do we mean to have someone like that in our life？🎼No。We mean only one thing。🎼To be loved。

To be accepted as we are。That's what that rich guy is craving。

All of our discontent and affairs of the heart。Hes really just a longing for someone to desire us。

For someone to find us。Lovable。To be in this cold， gray dismal world of so little caring。🎼Finally。

 finally。🎼Lovable。🎼That's all we want。You see it to be loved。Is a fundamental need of human nature。

You can have the prettiest girl in the world at your side。

It gets miserable really fast if there is no spark， no chemistry。More passion， no attraction。

No mutual respect if she doesn't endlessly amuse you。If she doesn't adore you。

Your relationship can only be one of emptiness。And。Every passionate relationship。🎼Began passionately。

As Shakespeare wrote。Whoever love？That love not a first sight。Falling in love。

Is that euphoric loss of sensibility， that exquisite madness that takes over all our senses。

It is a form of madness。It's like seeing a miracle that no one else can see。

It's like building a hut on an island over there and all your friends like going， what are you doing？

You understand， but they don't understand， you can see it， they can't。

That's what falling in love is like。The feeling described by the greatest Italian port Danunted。

He described it， he was the one who wrote the Divine comedy。

 and he also wrote a book called La Vita Noova。In it。

He describes first setting eyes on a girl named Beatrice。

He would go on to love her for the rest of his life。

And here's what he wrote about the first time he saw her。Keep in mind。

 this is written in the year 1302。He wrote。She was dressed in a very noble color， a delicate crimson。

Tied with a girdle and trimmed in a manner suitable to her tender age。

 she was called Beatrice by many who did not know what it meant to call her this。

The moment I saw her， I say in all truth that the vital spirit。

 which dwells in the inmost depths of the heart。Began to tremble so violently that I felt the vibration alarmingly in all my pulses。

 even the weakest of them。As it trembled， it uttered these words。Behold at God。

 more powerful than I who comes to rule over me。That's falling in love。Every passionate relationship。

🎼Began。You know， we spend a fortune hoping to achieve that state of being lovable。

We look for it in a pill or a lotion。🎼Or a gym。Men concentrate on success on wealth and power by attaining these things。

 they believe they can be more lovable。Women concentrate on being more attractive， more desirable。

 physically。It is all for just one thing， or one goal。To make us more lovable to the opposite sex。

🎼But no matter what we do， we can't seem to find some measure of acceptance of ourselves。🎼变成婴2。

That fundamental longing inner soul is what has fueled every endeavor of men There is no question that love in all its various guises is the world's most powerful emotion。

Inspiring， for instance。All the great poem。Great， incredible works of art。

 everything from Beethovens， moonlight Sonata to the Taj Mahal。Wars have been fought because of love。

Knights lived and died by the code of chivalry that's so called Court about。Love of the lady。

 the ideal。And you might be thinking， yeah， whatever's Z， I just want to pick up hot chicks。

 easy for you to say， I want to get laid。I would take that rich guys' girl， thanks。

I'll try and find happiness later。And that's fine。Nothing wrong with that。

what you will discover though， is that the better you get with women， the less you need them。

The less you need validation for yourself as a man。And the less you need women。

The more women you will have。The better you get with women。

 the less you will feel the need to prove it。To other guys。The things you think you've always wanted。

Are not what you really want at all。The girl you think you want in your life that will create happiness in you。

It's just a girl。I mean that in a good way， I mean that it isn't fair to project that onto her。

 to demand of her。That she makes you happy。There's too much to ask of anyone。

That's why our relationships die right in left。You know， you're listening to my talk for a reason。

You bought this DVD for a reason。We think it's about women。But this has never been about women。

This has never been about other men。This has always been about rediscovering your soul。

And regaining a former clarity。As you become more centered in yourself。

You get a purpose in life that isn't her。Slowly it begins to dawn on you。That the answer you seek。

Can never be found in a woman。Well that's my little discourse on love， I believe in love guys。

 I'm a romantic。Love at first sight is in our very nature， we can't help it。

It's the way we are built。It is now known that across all cultures， ancient and modern。

TheCelsea Islands， Japan， China， India， Polynesia， Africa。Canada。

Love at first sight is a natural human condition。By simply looking at someone for the first time。

Some feeling at the center of her being can be triggered。Every passionate relationship。

🎼Began passionately。The problem arises。When we expect that feeling to last forever。

And build lifetimes around it。So what is love？🎼Well。

Maybe love is the ability and willingness to allow her to be what she chooses to be for herself。

To just be beautiful， to be the beauty。Without any insistence。That she satisfies you。

How do you stay out of the， let's just be friends his zone？I basically tell her straight out。

 I'm not that guy。I tell her right off the bat that I'm different than other men she has met。

 and I also tell her that I'm one of the most honest men she's ever met。Honest with myself。

And honest with her。I know who I am。And what I like。

I tell her I will not lie to her to get her into bed。However， I don't view her as just a friend。

I have every intention of taking this further， and if she wants something else。

 I tell her I have the highest respect for her。And it's too bad because you're cute。

 you could have had some fun together。I tell her that as I move through this life。

 I seek to maximize my experiences and the experience of those around me。

I tell her that I have no intention of having a non romantic relationship with her straight up。

If she chooses not to stay， I understand not every girl wants the same thing as you。

 but all of them will say this， they'll say something to the fact of how refreshing he is to hear。

And they accept it with no judgment。It is amazing because when you approach a girl with this kind of honesty and directness。

There is no such thing as a last minute resistance or wait three months before sex or bitterness or feeling like you deceived her。

She knew。And by staying around for one minute longer with you after you told her what she's going to experience。

She is complicit in her own seduction。🎼Women love it。All right。

 so let's imagine for a minute that you have discovered， approached and attracted into your life。

 the girl of your dreams， the one， if you will。Someone who takes your breath away and happily it's reciprocal。

 she really likes you to。The two of you are inseparable， excited by one another。

 and feel like you've known each other forever。You can't stop thinking about her and you might even feel that you are。

🎼In love。And so you embark on this journey of life together。Now what？

How do you manage the relationship？How do you maintain it？🎼The age old question。

How do you keep the love alive？Unfortunately， relationships today。

 modern relationships almost always follow the same typical and predictable path。

 they have a life cycle that repeats itself over and over again。

Now I have identified seven distinct stages that I think virtually every relationship goes through。

Stage1。They meet and start to date。As the man and woman start to spend more and more time together。

They begin to desire exclusivity with each other， they are dating each other。

 spending a lot of time together， really starting to enjoy each other。In stage one。

And they both want to move on too。Stage two。Stage two is a point where a guy and a girls start to refer to each other as boyfriend and girlfriend。

They stop seeing other people。And this is either directly agreed upon。

 let's stop seeing other people。Or it is tacitly agreed and quietly understood。🎼Either way。

They are both under the impression that they are exclusively each other in stage two。Stage three。

Comes along next。This is the stage several months or years down the road when they are completely comfortable with each other。

They are happy together， they do a lot of fun and exciting things together。

 they have wonderful communication， great sex， they go for drinks， they know each other so well。

 they start to merge their friends， etc。This is that euphoric time when the typical relationship is the most blissful。

And they are very， very much in love。🎼Stage 3。Stage four comes along。And this is the stage。

Where they settle into the routine of daily life。They are very comfortable with each other and they know each other so very well。

They have their ups and downs， of course， the normal vicisitudes of life。

They go to their separate jobs， they attend their various classes。

She has coffee with her girlfriends， he watches football with his buddies， normal life。But routine。

Is starting to settle in。In this stage， they start to long for the days of St three。

 when they had more time to spend together， when they did fun and exciting things together before they got bogged down with routine and bills。

 general life。It seems like their focus is no longer directed in towards them and their plans together。

There is a quiet unrest。That is starting to simmer underneath。

This is the stage where they start to say things like。Where are we going to be in five years？

They start to question what it is they really want。

And this is the stage where they say to each other。We need to take more time for each other。

 seems like we're too busy to do things together anymore。

They decide to do something like have a date night once a week。Stage four。

Stage five comes along when they realize that all their best intentions。About communicating more。

 having a date night， et cetera， are not really working。They have the intention， the desire。

But daily life gets in the way， and so they both get more and more frustrated。

Sex is happening less and less often and when it does happen。It is。Dispassionate， unremarkable。

 uninspired。Now they're starting to resent each other somewhat。

And they're surprised that the traits that they really liked in each other at the beginning are now the very things that annoy them the most now。

This is the stage where they cast about looking for relief。

This is where affairs are usually introduced。🎼Stage 5。The next stage。

Stage six is where it starts to get a little more nasty。This is where accusations start to fly。

At this point， one of them is usually extremely bitter and confrontational。

🎼And the other one is becoming more and more apathetic。He or she simply doesn't care anymore。

This is a critical stage， stage six， can their relationship be restored？Good question。Stage 7。

Make a break time。This is the stage where they separate。

 they are still technically connected by taking a break。

Everything is drastic and drastic measures are taken。They may try to get back together。

 but only when one insists they need counseling， et cea。They go back and forth。

 sad and hurt until they ultimately either end it。🎼Or shakily get back together and try again。

That is how relationships naturally progress today， that's seven stages。

It is so predictable and recurring that it is amazing we are so optimistic going in to begin with。

And yet even though we see this happen time， time again in the relationships of people we know。

 as well as our own relationships。We still hope for the best。And do it all over again。

With the next one。We have， of course， in the tales of King Arthur， the fable of Sir Gawain。

 renowned by women far and wide for his skill at Luff talking。

An illated attempt to explain what women desire most。

Forces King Arthur under duress to promise the hand of Sir Gawain in marriage to the losly Dame Regnel。

Well that night， the evervaliant and loyal go in。Leads her。To their bridal chamber。And when asked。

 obliges her by kissing her fully and adoringly on her hideous lips。

He did it as a favor to King Arthur and for the kingdom。

So he marries his Dame raggnell and then she's hideous。

 but he does it anyway and she asks for a kiss and he gives it to her， he is then amazed。

To see her magically transformed into the form of a truly beautiful woman。

This is in the evening and she explains，You know， sir， that I have been under an enchantment。

Forever condemned to foremost vile an enchantment only to be broken when a man was found willing to wed with me。

With no thought。For my ugly form。You have broken the spell。There is， however。

 another choice he must make mine husband for the enchantment to be truly broken。

For the rest of your life。You will have to decide if you will have me fair by night for you alone and follow by day。

Or will you have me follow by night and fair by day for all your friends？The choice is yours。Lady。

Good way and reply。There was about one answer to be given。The choice must be yours。

At which point she cried， Husband， you have truly broken the spell。"。

I am now able to fully choose whether to be fair or foul。

 I choose to be only and always fair for you。For you have given to me with every woman。

 indeed husband， every man as well desires most。The right to choose for myself， who？

And what I am to be。You know， there's only when you're with someone。

 there's only a very short time when you can really give each other things for free。

With neither of you having to ask。Because later on， all you do is make demands of each other。

Perhaps the only difference between her and all the rest in the beginning。

Is that she's asking you for nothing？So how do we do it better， is there a better way。

 how do you avoid that dismal mess？🎼It's difficult。But it's all in how you set it up initially。

You know， you always hear people say that you have to be happy with yourself before you can be happy with someone else。

Well， that's true。But it's also true that experiences in life are amplified once shared。

Society has created this cycle that all relationships seem to follow。It has these restrictions。

Of the way it should be on all sides， like a box。It should begin in this way。

 you need to have these make these sorts of promises to each other。

 and it needs to be understood or stated that this is forever。We start with a feeling。

And we head way over there into the future。This is the framework that society expects of us。

 it is the framework。Our friends， family， our education， the media expect of us。And invariably。

 it degrades to what I just described。My take on relationships is this。In my mind。

 a relationship should never be constructed。It should never be examined。Never be analyzed。

It should never get to the point where we ask。Where are we going to be in five years？

It should be pure and beautiful and natural in its own right。Without having to be。

Propped up and without having to。Work on the relationship。

Just like Heisenberg's uncertainty principle from physics。

 it applies to relationships it states that the moment you attempt to examine something you change it。

In a relationship。As soon as you question where it is going or what the plan is， you change it。

And you both need to understand that from the very beginning。

If you are with a wonderful girl right now that you adore， never should you say to her， okay。

 now this is what I expect from you going forward。Or you must be a certain way。Forever。

Or now you need to behave more like whatever。The only thing you should ever say to her is I had a wonderful time with you today。

🎼And I want to see you again tomorrow。That's it。And who knows？

I think if you can relax in your relationship and just let her flow。

Only then is it possible for the two of you to be together forever。You shouldn't analyze it。

But you should be amazed by it no matter how long it lasts。That's just me。

 others might need a bit more structure and comfort。One thing is for sure。

 having to work on a relationship is the death knell of it。As far as I'm concerned。

What unfathomable loss of love and freshness， loss of？Redemption， loss of passion， loss of。

Of everything I consider to be good。Just contained in that phrase， work on the relationship。

But you say，Re are work。They are， after all， a sublime compromise。

 a willingness to see ourselves reflected and fulfilled in the desires and dreams of our wonderful companion。

This is absolutely correct and the way it should be。But it doesn't happen very often。

 rarely do relationships， traditional relationships， find this equilibrium this ideal。

You know what I mean， we talk about how it is a shared responsibility a 5050 compromise。

And we talk of the need to work out our issues， and then when faced with the last ragged edge of our discontent。

🎼To seek counseling。Wrong， wrong。I'll tell you the secret of a long lasting relationship， me。

 the seducer。Here's the secret。If you get together with a girl and you get married or whatever。

And you get caught up in the routines of life without examining your soul。

Your relationship will fail。In other words。If you go to work every day， come home every day。

 watch the same television shows every day， mow the lawn on the weekend。

And then start it all over again the next week and never seek to become a more excellent person。

 the notion of self discovery and improvement。Your relationship will fail。

If you never explore the beauty of her。And seek to understand her。🎼给我废啊。If you never listen。

 really listen to her。🎼It will fail。We think that what is important to get ahead。

 to get a bigger house， to acquire more things， to fill our lives with activities because we don't ever want to be caught doing nothing。

We think that's important if you do this。Take your kids to soccer， go to a restaurant。

 have your date night or whatever， and the two of you are not on some kind of spiritual journey together。

Your relationship will fail。And by spiritual， I mean that in the broadest sense of the term。I mean。

 the two of you are seeking to understand each other and yourselves and your place in this world as best you can。

It can only last if the two of you are seeking to become more excellent in life。If you don't do this。

Your relationship will fail。We all know of couples that have stayed together for many years。

 a lot of times these couples are not really still in love。They sleepwalk through their lives。

 they have just given up。They have settled。Dregs settle。In your glass of wine。Occasionally， however。

 you will find a couple that has been together a long time and they are still crazy by each other give your grandparents。

It's rare。But it happens。If you ask them about it though， they will always say。

It hasn't always been good。There have been times of severe trouble， but we work through it。

We stayed the course and we are better for it today。This is because they have discovered one thing。

Love is not feeling。🎼A pleasant sensation。🎼Love is an art。Love is an art。Just like living is an art。

And as such， it requires theory， skill。And practice。To a true seducer， a lover of women。

🎼Relationships never end。Think about that for a second。A true seducer realizes this。

He is connected to the women in his life forever， there is no animosity， there are no hard feelings。

His relationship with her never ends。Sure， he might not be with her physically throughout her life。

But he has touched her so profoundly。That she will always carry him around him。How is this possible？

How is it that the women he has had relationships with love him forever and are his biggest defenders？

Isn't it true that when a relationship ends， it ends badly？Not necessarily。See。

 a woman is a butterfly that landed on your hand。You must be very still and enjoy it。

As long as you can before she flies away。You need to recognize that you've been blessed with her presence。

Need to delight in that butterfly。And it is very important that you curl your hand up slightly。

To kick the wind off her。Women want to be protected。They want to rest there for a while。

🎼Knowing they're safe。And knowing they wanted there。Will she eventually fly away？🎼Possibly。

Because people change and grow， people need different things in different stages of their lives。

 and so you need to keep your hand very still and admire that little butterfly for as long as she stays。

And she may stay for the rest of your life。It's up to you， actually。

She will stay there as long as you remain fascinated by her。

The moment you take your eyes off her and get distracted。🎼She will notice it。

And if you do this long enough。She will eventually fly away。

Most men can't stand the fact that she might fly away someday and so they attempt to hold her fast。

 they close her hand around her。To keep her at all costs， to restrict your movement。

So she can barely breathe anymore。This is jealousy， and it will cause her to struggle to get away。

A woman must be free to leave。Only then will she stay。You know。

 women will move in and out of your life。Cherish them when they come in。

And cherish them when they go out。I never have bad breakups， I miss every girl I've ever been with。

And they will never say a bad word about you， even long after you're no longer a couple。

Long after you're no longer together。How is this possible because you gave her room to breathe？

To be together apart。You respected her that much Women will only， say bad things about you。

 will only feel disappointed in you and will only feel cheated。

If they thought you promised something to them。🎼That you didn't deliver。

If you promised her forever and you didn't deliver it。She will resent you。

If you are honest from the outset about the way that you approach life and loving in relationships。

She will never feel cheated if it ends。She will defend you forever because she understands you。

And you didn't lie to her。And the concept of breaking up。What a thought。You know， I am always struck。

 but in this world of so little caring。It's an unbelievably profound thing to tell someone who loves you。

Who really cares about you？It would be really sad if you were hurt or hungry or lost。

To stop caring for you to go away。Please， leave my life。Please stop caring about me。

What a thing to do。You will come to a point in your journey when you will realize the following。

A woman can come into your life。And become your muse and your source of inspiration， I beauty。

That colors everything you do。Then someday。That same woman may slip away from him。

He will both be sad and he will miss each other terribly。

But the memory of the beauty she infused into your life。

Will never be overshadowed by the cloud of a deteriorating relationship。And that is a profound。

🎼And beautiful realization。Once you get to that point in your life。

 when you can gently let go of the beautiful woman。All things are possible with women。

And you will have become that honest， loving， desirable seducer。

That all women secretly admire and crave。You know， a lot of people。

Advocate open relationships that we are culturally conditioned with unrealistic expectations of monogamy。

After all， sex and love are two different things。We should never allow our strong bond。

 our relationship to be destroyed。By a simple biological act。Our sex drive， sex is just gymnastics。

shouldnn't kill your love for one another。Well， that works great in theory。

But it's far more difficult in practice。This is because no matter how enlightened we think we are。

Most of us。He experienced some modeicum of jealousy if our spouse or our lover has a sexual relationship with someone else。

I think it is crucial to understand what jealousy is and what it is about。Jealousy is about fear。

Fear of the unknown and of change。Fear of losing power or control in a relationship。

Fear of scarcity and of loss。Fear of abandonment， fear of rejection。

We take it as a reflection of our own insecurity about our worthiness。

Anxiety about being adequate as a lover and doubts about our own desirability。

 that's what jealousy is at a root。So what is it that bothers us so much when our girlfriend or wife？

Has an affair with someone else。Let's explore that for a moment。

Let's imagine you're in a relationship with a wonderful， wonderful girl。

 you've been together for a few years and let's say you're married。You love each other immensely。

 but there is no longer any passion in your relationship。

You move through your days as if you two are asleep walking together。

 you carry your lunch Pa to work。Every day， she goes to her job every day。

 and in the evening you watch TV together every day。You hardly sleep together at all anymore。However。

 she is a wonderful woman and you have some wonderful times together。Sounds pretty normal， right？

You know， she's not sexually satisfied anymore， but you're so tired after work most of the time。

And so busy。You just want to go to sleep。It would be okay if she just wanted a quickie。

 but she's going to want for full treatment tonight， lots of forplay， et cetera。

 and you just don't have the energy tonight for a full production。That's normal。

 that's what we are normally life。So life goes on and this continues。Imagining this right。

 but then one day you notice。She hasn't asked you for sex in quite a long time。In fact。

 now that you think about it。She's being unusually happy these days。Instantly， you suspect what？

She is having an affair。So you confront her。Of course， she's not having an affair she laughs no。

But then she tells you something， she tells you about this new company in town that offers the opportunity to have a virtual affair。

Not interactive computer sex。With a real person on the other end of a computer connection。

But a simulated environment。A controlled environment in which you can have sex with a completely simulated person she tells you it feels exactly like real sex。

 but in fact you just lie there on a table completely still with all your clothes on。

And all the experiences are caused by computers stimulating your brain to make it seem as though you're actually having sex。

And it is marvelous sex。She tells you， all the thrills of an affair。

But because there's no third person involved。Is it really infidelity？🎼How will this make you feel。

🎼你比较。Well， there's two ways to look at。If we don't mind that she goes to the gym and then head over to her cybers appointment。

Then that would suggest that the crucial factor of infidelity is the involvement of another person。

 that's what we don't like another person there。But if we don't like her having this virtual sex。

 it bothers us。Then it would seem that it is not the role of a third party that is the problem after all。

What is upsetting us is not that she is turning towards someone else or in this case something else。

What upsets you is that she is turning away from you。In other words。

 when she goes out to have a virtual sex appointment。It signals that she has stopped seeing you。

🎼As the person。To which she wants to express herself sexually。This I think is the whole crux of it。

 this is what bothers us so much about infidelity。If our girlfriend or wife sleeps with another guy。

We tend to get mad at him。When really it has nothing to do with him at all， why I get mad at him？

It's not his fault， no one， no one ever steals your woman， she leaves。

Of her own volition she leaves because she has to。My own personal view of jealousy is this。

If that beautiful， wonderful woman that I am with， who I say I respect and adore so much。

Ever meets a man that she would rather be with than me。Then who am I to stop her？

What right do I have to impede her happiness？She's not my possession。

She has the right to be happy in life。And if she would be happier with someone else with him。

Then she should be allowed that freedom you。For fun。

I always introduce girls to other people as my sister。

This includes girls I just met and even my girlfriend。She's youth by now。For instance。

If my girlfriend and I are together and someone ask，So were you guys together？

I usually answer something like what us？Now this is my sister， she's kind of cute for her sister。

 she's totally available too man， I will totally say stuff to that all the time in front of her。

 she's used to it。Another thing that's fun to say when my girlfriend and I are asked if we are a couple。

 I will always answer，No， we're usually a threesome， but yet the girl couldn't make it。

It's no fun to say that kind of stuff if my girlfriend is not around to hear me say it。

 that's half the fun you want to get her to punch you on the arm。

 I always say stuff like out when she's around。I also introduced girls I just met as my sister。

For instance， I was talking to a girl I just met her at a party one time， just met her。

 and a friend of mine walked up。And he's like，Hey Anne， how you been？Very good't you？Doing good。

 doing good， and he's glancing over at this girl who I'm talking to， wanting to be introduced。

 she's extremely hot。And I'm like， oh， hey。Let me introduce you to my sister。When you say that。

 you smile and wink at her like it's an inside joke， let me introduce you to my sister。

 this is Sylvia。And he's like， your sister， Ha， his interest level goes way up， well， hello， Sylvia。

It's fun， I do this all the time， the guy will start to make all kinds of overtures to your sister。

 and I just sit back and laugh and wink at the girl。She'll talk to him and play along。But of course。

 he wants nothing to do with the guy。This is because what I just did。

It is very similar to a takeaway and is very powerful。Essentially， it cements your status with her。

In her mind。Or for another example， I'll be sitting in a restaurant where the girl and the waitres will arrive and it'll go something like this。

The waitres will say hello， my name is Angela and I'll be your waitress for the evening。

 Can I get you anything to drink， I will immediately sayH Angela。

 I'm Z and this is my sister Nicole I'll have a with limeme。Always have fun with that。

🎼The beauty of this is that it completely takes the girl off guard。 You do it in a joking way。

 Ser to the person you were introducing her to the guy or the waitress。

But covertly smiling and winking to the girl you're with。They absolutely love it。

The thinly veiled implication here is that you are confident enough in yourself to present her to others as your sister。

And what's great is they will usually go along with a joke。

And then laugh and hit you on the arm later。That is the state you want to be in with a girl it's kind of like James Bond and Money Penny he's always flirting with her and she always applieslies。

" oh James， you're incorrigible that is the rapport you want to create between women and you。

 women love it Try it sometime It's a lot of fun。We need to accept the ways in which we are different。

It's like it's kind of like we were swimming in the ocean。Some people like to swim near the surface。

 where it is wonderful and refreshing， not a care in the world。

Near the surface it is light and there is very little pressure。

It is easy to swim fast and have a lot of fun。You can see the sunlight rippling on the surface above。

 and you know。You are very close to the way out。All you have to do is swim up and you're out。

It is kind of an easy light green。And some people。Like to swim deeper in the ocean。

 where it starts to become more vibrant and rich。There's much more to see here。

 wonderful fish sea creatures and coral and exotic looking plants。Beautiful and vibrant。

But there is more pressure。Its a little slower going， and if you are this deep。

It is not as easy to get to the surface。There's a lot more pressure。

 but also a far more serene and reflective experience， he is more profound。And meaningful。Either way。

 it's fine。But every person tends to prefer one or the other。

You will find that you might like to be deep in the ocean where it is colorful and vibrant。

But the woman you're with。Might not be comfortable so deep。She might like to swim near the surface。

Now， if you encourage her。She will come down for a while and swim a little deeper with you because she really does love you。

But eventually， she might feel she can't breathe or the pressure is too much for her to bear。

And she will have to return to the surface。That's what relationships today are like。

 people like to swim at different depths。There's nothing you can do about it。

You have to enjoy swimming with that wonderful woman who has come into your life for as long as you can。

But you can never change the depth she prefers。Therein lies a lot of our problems。🎼In a relationship。

And finding someone who likes to swim at the same depth as you is not very easy。In fact。

 you might wish you were more of a surface person。Because it seems so much easier and you don't have to feel so deeply。

 but you can't， or vice versa， you might wish you could swim deeper。

 but you need to be near the surface。But this knowledge that we all have different levels that we're comfortable with will free you from the unreasonable expectations you place on her you have to let her swim where she is most comfortable and happy。

And by doing so， you might lose her。As the current drifts you to apart。But if you don't。

If you try to force her to stay with you at your chosen depth。You will definitely lose her。

Definitely。Another example。Met， the famous impressionmist painter。

 he spent the last half of his life painting the same bridge over and over again at different times of the day。

 different seasons。Over and over again。The same bridge， and as he aged and his eyesight worsened。

 the paintings get blurriier and blurriier and blurrier， same bridge。

 and a little bit harder to make out what it is， but it's the same bridge。

That he always painted that。Is traditional modern relationships。

 we keep entering into the same relationships over and over and over again。

 We think this one will be different。But it's just the same old bridge painting we've always done。

 and as time goes on。Each relationship we enter into is less carefully painted because we are losing our ability to see。

On the other hand， Vermeer。The 16th century Dutch master。

He painted amazing scenes of ordinary people in ordinary clothes。Doing ordinary things。

His painting of the lacemakerr is very famous and even more famous is the girl with the pearl earring。

Very famous paintings。But what everyone agrees that is remarkable about Vermeer's painting way ahead of his time。

Is the way he painted light。It is surreal and beautiful， in fact。

 there are some who say that he really only painted light。Not the subjects in his painting。

He wanted to show that the light was the important theme of the picture if there was no light。

Nothing else in the picture mattered， they were just objects。He didn't see it as a table。

But is an object reflecting light back at him。That is the enlightened approach to relationships。

 you don't want to paint your relationships like1 A。Paintking the same thing over and over again。

 and losing clarity and insight in the process。You want to paint your relationships like Vermeer。

In such a way。That the beauty of the light reflected off of it。Enries the lives of you and her。

And everyone else around。
