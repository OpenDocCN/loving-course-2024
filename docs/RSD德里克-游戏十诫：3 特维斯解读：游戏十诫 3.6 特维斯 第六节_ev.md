# RSD德里克-游戏十诫：3 特维斯解读：游戏十诫 3.6 特维斯 第六节_ev

Commment 6， thou shalt remember to have sincere fun。I can already hear you right now， Travis。

 how do I have the fun， How do I deploy the fun maneuver， How do I execute the fun。

The commandment is， thou shalt remember to have sincere fun， not fake fun。

 especially not fake fun to use as a technique。 Remember， this is about you。Also， note。

 the commandment is thou shalt remember to have sincere fun， not thou shalt be sincerely funny。

Although it helps to be funny， what this commandment is about is sincerely enjoying yourself and having fun。

You don't necessarily need to be laughing or goofing around。

 you just need to remember to have your version of sincere fun。As a side note。

 your sense of humor will emerge out of this enjoyment。

With the processes you have built until now between approach strategy， default openers。

 gathering logistics， and conveying identity， you may have been having conversations that lead to nowhere。

This commandment is important because game is emotional。

This is something that is often forgotten by logical or thinking type of individuals。

If you have a logical conversation with a woman， the logical thing for her to do is to wish you have a good night or try to get your phone number because it is quite logical to go on many dates before having sex。

However， if you have an emotional conversation， you will both be engaging with very emotional activities such as in club makeouts。

 double makeouts， heavy grinding， same night lays and other lewd and career activities you might dream up。

😊，In old pickup theory， they recall this buying temperature or how hot of an emotional state a woman is in。

This emotion is not specific to any particular man。

 but it is an internal state she feels that is agnostic to anyone around her。

If you find a woman who has been standing in one place for the whole night。

 her buying temperature is quite low。If you find a woman who is making out with literally every guy in the club。

 her buying temperature is quite high。Although we have covered the base of getting into the interaction。

 commanding attention， screening， gathering logistics。

 and letting yourself flow in these conversations， we have not yet specifically covered how to raise emotions And we raise these emotions in others by raising our very own buying temperatures or very own emotional state and let this highly emotional state transfer off to the other women that you talk to。

Remember， whatever you feel， they will feel。When you remember to have sincere fun。

 you will find the girl engaging in very emotional behaviors。

 And when you are both engaging in emotional behaviors。

 you both can have some sincere fun together later on in the night。😊。

M'll check everything that has been discussed。 Commandments 1 through 5。

 The fun is already inside of you， and we will add this on top of what you have already learned。

 We will take this commandment to discuss what it means to have sincere fun。

 how you might have lost it and then how to get it back。I could just end this commandment by saying。

 remember， kid， have sincere fun and be done with it。

But you might protest and say something like but Travis。

 I keep forgetting to have sincere fun or but Travis， I don't know how to have the fun。 By the way。

 I hate going to clubs。 They're loud。 They smell， and the people are idiots。😡。

So let's get liter on how to enjoy yourself。First， let's talk about how other people typically have sincere fun。

Typically， when people go out， fun usually involves a few things， talking with friends， laughing。

 dancing， heavy alcohol consumption。While you can take the approach of heavily drinking。

 there are some obvious side effects。First off， the effect on your health is not fantastic from liver failure。

 hypertension and other chronic diseases that will affect you later in life。

 not to mention the ensuing headache， lethargy and hangover the next morning。

 which is not useful at all。 In fact， it is quite embarrassing。

 especially if you are a business owner or a working professional。Also。

 many of our listeners are under the drinking age of 21 in America or under the age of 18 in other countries。

 And while we can debate the legitimacy of the law。

 your future self will thank you from refraining from alcohol consumption until your brain is fully developed。

There's the additional problem of alcoholism， and then the worst problem of alcohol dependence。

 where if you are drinking every time you go out， you grow dependent upon it to have any fun at all。

 which is just a gateway to alcohol addiction。Furthermore。

 your game gets extraordinarily sloppy when you are drunk。

 You forget to pull losing the set because you got distracted。

 losing the set because you were too busy vomiting。

 Los the set because you got in the fight with some loser。

 And we won't even get started on whiskky Dickck。And if none of these other reasons。

 if you end up too intoxicated， you are likely to make horrible decisions that could end up costing you your life as you know it or end your whole career。

While a couple drinks would not be so bad， it might even be useful to loosen up a little bit。

 I wholeheartedly recommend against it as a tool to have sincere fun， especially for people who。

 if they have one drink， they end up having 12。Many of Drek's former assistants that I have talked to have all stopped drinking as of recently and have reported that their energy。

 their moods， how they feel， and their overall health has skyrocketed。Despite all this。

 something interesting happens to people who are drunk。They seem to be having sincere fun。

They seem to have no inhibitions， and they seem to be able to say and do whatever they want and have fun with it。

Now， I'm no biologist， but I do have to ask， are the words they say put inside of the liquor or do they just allow the words inside their head to come up freely？

In each mixed drink is the fun put inside of the alcohol。

 or do they just relax enough to change their interpretations of what is fun？

I bring this up because it is important to know that the fun is already inside of you。

 not some substance。Back in Commandment1， I spoke about some natural patterns we take on when we are first born。

This might come as a big surprise to a lot of you， but our default mode is happiness。

The unresolved and unarticulated experiences throughout one's life stifled this natural state of happiness。

 but that original childlike joy never went away。Since the fun is inside of you。

 your only job is learning how to coax it out。Another note to make about this is that sincere fun comes from a physiological change in your body。

 A physiological change in your body leads to a physiological change in your mind。

Are people dancing and laughing because they are having fun or are they having fun because they are laughing and dancing？

Your understanding of cause and effect in this case might be reversed。

So the act of laughing or dancing happens first， and then the sincere fun comes afterwards。

So to coax the fun out of ourselves， we need to physically induce a physiological change in our own bodies。

What kind of physiological change when people laugh， dance or socialize with their friends。

 it has the physiological effect of promoting relaxation by relieving tension。

 Str and any other anxiety while promoting arousal by raising your positive emotions。

 promoting happiness and enjoyment。😊，So now to coax the fun out of ourselves。

 we need to physically induce a physiological change in our bodies that promotes relaxation and arousal。

A final note is that sincere fun comes from a place of interpretation。

You might find some things fun and other things not so fun。Furthermore。

 this could change depending on what emotional state you are in。

This is completely a matter of personal preference。Overall， to coax the fun out of ourselves。

 we have to make a physiological change in our own bodies and a psychological change in the interpretations of the world around us。

Therefore， remembering to have sincere funds simply means two things。One。

 remembering to engage with activities that you naturally enjoy， more specifically。

 engage in activities that physiologically promote relaxation and arousal。And two。

 remember to find enjoyment in the experiences you are already having。In other words。

 having sincere fun means doing the things you enjoy and enjoying the things you do。😊。

If you fail to do things you enjoy and to enjoy the things you do。

 your life will be dull and unexciting， and the girl will see you as some combination of anxious and boring。

😊，Where did we lose all of this？If our default mode is happiness。

 where did we forget to have sincere fun。I'll break it down into two sections。

 why we don't do the things we enjoy and why we don't enjoy the things that we do。First。

 why we don't do the things that we enjoy。Psychologist Abraham Maslow outlined almost a century ago Maslow's hierarchy of needs。

This hierarchy describes human needs by five tiers that are stacked upon one another。

 meaning that humans will have a tough time proceeding to the next tier without having the previous one satisfied。

Those needs in order are physiological needs or air， food， water， rest， safety needs， in other words。

 safety and security。Belongingness and love needs that being intimate relationships and friends。

Esteem needs that being prestige and feeling of accomplishment。And finally， self actualization。

 which is achieving one's full potential， including creative activities。

You can look up Maswell's hierarchy of needs， for your own reference。

In order to address safety needs， physiological needs have to be covered first。

In order to address belonginginess and social needs， physiological needs had to be covered first。

If we expect to start improving our self esteem needs。Physiological。

 safety and belonginginess and social needs will need to be covered as well。Finally。

 to achieve one's full potential like you will be doing with this program。All of your esteem。

 belongingness， safety， and physiological needs must be fulfilled。

This hierarchy of needs explains the decision making process of people in poverty。

If someone doesn't have the money and has the choice between eating or having a place to sleep。

 they'll choose eating。It is very difficult to get out of this place， as both Derek and myself know。

 since we've both experienced this at some point in our earlier lives。

Which is why we work so hard all the time and invest all our money back into training programs to get the extra edge over our competition。

 You can't climb out of something like that。 You have to find someone who can pull you out and show you a better way。

This next point is very important。 Remembering to have sincere fun can quite naturally happen when your other needs are covered。

It is difficult to remember to have sincere fun when you are gasping for air or if you're trapped on the desert without water。

Moreover， it is hard to remember to have sincere fun if you feel threatened at all。

 or if you don't have a tribe of people around you that you feel belonged to。

 or if you are not actively accomplishing the things in your own life。Again。

 these needs are physiological， safety， belongingness， and self esteem。

All this means is if you have any of these needs to worry about。

 it will get in your way of remembering to have sincere fun。Now。

 some of you might have all of these needs in check。

 The next problem is the feeling that you might have some of these needs taken away as a price to pay if you choose to have sincere fun。

Having sincere fun might cost you your phological needs。For example。

 you might lose out on having your bills paid for food and water if you choose to have fun instead。

Your safety needs， for example， think going on a roller coaster or skydiving。

 it could cause tremendous damage。It might cost you your belongingness and social needs， for example。

 you might get kicked out of a social group。Or it might cost you your esteem needs。

It might cost you a win you've been working very hard for if you choose to have fun instead。

I already discussed back in commandment1 how we have to follow the rules of our guardians and protectors when we are first born to depend upon them。

That means that we had to play by their own rules。 And if we weren't supposed to have fun or if there were some threat to having fun。

 then we would choose instead to fit in， play it safe and be like the others and do what they were doing。

If you don't perceive there to be in abundance of these other needs。

 where you could risk losing some of these things in order to have some fun。

Then you might choose not to do the things you enjoy doing。In other words。

 if you feel like these needs are at stake by having sincere fun。

 you might choose not to do the things that you already enjoy。😊，Overall。

 we don't do the things we enjoy because we might have other needs we need to have addressed。

 or we might feel that those very needs will be threatened if we do the things that we actually enjoy doing。

Second。Why don't we enjoy the things that we are already doing。

The previous two points apply here as well。 If we are missing other needs or if doing the things we enjoy puts these other needs at risk。

 we might not enjoy the things we might otherwise find enjoyable。For example。

 it's hard to be out at a club when you're hungry。Or it is especially hard to enjoy seeing a movie when you know there's a heavy deadline for a project coming up。

And it is especially hard to go talk to women if you don't have any other friends。

 because a feeling of losing your social belongingness is just too intense。

Another reason why you might not enjoy the things that you're already doing is that maybe you're having too much fun or maybe you're not having any fun at all。

 There is a term in psychology called the hedonic treadmill。

 which is your ability to return to a baseline after some positive or negative event in your life。😊。

If you spend all of your time having fun， not only will no real work be accomplished。

 but you'll be depressed because you are giving yourself no chance to go back to your baseline level of satisfaction。

Think of someone who parties every single day of the week。

 They are literally so exhausted that they can't even appreciate the experience any more。

The flip side of the coin is that you have no fun at all。

 Think of someone who just works all the time doesnn't fill his life with the experiences that he wants and the people he wants to meet。

It's hard to feel excited when your life is filled with the boring and mundane。

This is a perfect recipe for a burnout， by the way。Although the team。

 Derek spends most of our waking hours working on some project。

 we are traveling every single weekend to a new city， finding a new adventure to have。

 and finding fun in building these new projects and these new systems。Finally。

 maybe you don't enjoy the things you are currently doing because either the perceived challenge level of a task is too high or the perceived challenge level of that same task might be too low。

Consider the difficulty level of a video game。If the difficulty level of the game is too low。

 you'll become bored and unengaged。If it is too high， you'll become frustrated。

When it is right in the middle， it becomes enjoyable。However， with video games。

 there is nothing to lose。 You could just start over。What about the difficulty of a college exam？

Your GP is at stake， and maybe your ability to get into a top graduate school。

 If it is too difficult， you'll be worried and even anxious。 If it is too easy。

 you might just not care too much and might get bored taking the exam。Alternatively。

 the reason you don't enjoy the things you are currently doing is that your perceived skill level at something might be too high or your perceived skill level at something might be too low。

 in which the same results as above will be reflected。

If the difficulty is just right or the skill level is just right。

 you just might enjoy yourself solving the problems right in front of you。In sum。

 we don't enjoy the things that we are currently doing because it might interfere with our other needs。

 Youre having too much fun or no fun at all， or because there is a mismatch between your perceived challenge level and your perceived skill level at the task at hand。

😊，These obstacles， through remember to have sincere fun are as clear as I could possibly articulate。

 maybe be as clear as you might ever ask for。If you can remember to have sincere fun in the rest of your life。

 then you can remember to have sincere fun in the nightclub。

Now here are some strategies for clearing these out。Warning。

 these are meant to help you have sincere fun。 They are not needed。

 So if you are lacking in these areas， don't let it discourage you from going out anyways。Strategy1。

If you can remember to have abundance and the rest of the needs in your life。

 then you can give yourself permission to enjoy yourself and remember to have sincere fun。

Check out Derek's elite lifestyle Bible and the 10 Commandments of the game Core module。

It is the most detailed description you could possibly ask for for getting your life in order so you could spend more time having fun instead of worrying about some other areas of your life。

You can not see why I've been asking you for some time to get your diet fitness and meditation routines in place。

For your physiological needs， make sure that you are eating healthy and well fed before going out。

You'll notice a negative difference if you go out to a nightclub while hungry。For your safety needs。

 make sure that you are exercising。 It is very rare that you will ever get into a fight if youre not being a complete idiot。

 but it helps knowing that you have an abundance of safety by being able to handle yourself。

 So again， make sure that you are exercising。For your belonginginess needs， find the tribe。

 This is not hard to do。 connect with the winds in your area that are also going out。

VIP tours for this。 The Brotherhood is for this， and boot camp is for this。

Any major city I go to in the entire planet， there is someone I know there from each of these platforms who I can go hang out with and go game with。

Finally， for your self esteem needs， make sure you are setting goals that you can achieve and accomplish those goals every day so that you can feel you are winning and build your sense of accomplishment there。

You get to set how easy or difficult these goals are just 1% better every day is all you need。

I provided you in previous commandments ways to set easier goals for yourself so that you can make incremental improvements every day in this area of your life。

 from just walking up to a woman to practicing an opener to just asking for directions。

 to giving a quick open and walking off to giving a real open to driving the interaction forward with your identity and so on and so forth。

A special note should be made about your peer group。 Be very careful to choose the people around you。

 They are going to have boundaries of their own， who they like， who they don't like。

 What influences they allow in their lives and what they find enjoyable or not enjoyable。😊。

Choose these people wisely your peer group should be one that helps you achieve your goals。

 one that you can feel a part of， and one where people also have fun of their own。

Choose the ones that have your boundaries as well。 Pay for entry。 If you must。

 you will likely have to pay for entry in order to meet other connectors that will introduce you to other high quality people and adjacent social networks。

 These people have deep moats and tall walls around them。

 You'll likely have to be a part of the social group that they are part of in order to connect with them。

The rule I mentioned in commandment 4 on cover charges applies here as well。

 The steeper the cover charge， the higher quality of people you will find on the inside。From there。

 you will share high quality conversations and go on to have higher quality experiences together。😊。

Furthermore， be very， very careful about the thoughts and media that you allow into your own head。

Social media is just a free for all for crazy ideas。

 Make sure you are following content that will build you up an unfollowing people who seem to not reflect your worldview。

You might be thinking， oh， well， I could just look at the content and ignore the content that doesn't help me。

But the insidious effect here is that it will affect you。

 and it will affect you in the slightest and most subtle of ways。

 and every little chisel erodes you down even more。

Just one look or one thing or one time is already too much。

 Be careful of the things you put in your head。 Make sure it is truly reflective of your three sacred questions。

 Curate your social media content in a way that leads you towards yourself self defined lifestyle or better yet。

 just avoid social media altogether and replace it with real world experience。Strategy 2。

 I mentioned this before， but I will mention it again。

 Carve out some time in your day to do the things you enjoy。

Look no further than the Three Sacr Ques Handbook to see the things you enjoy most。

 and then go and do those things。The right way to have fun is your favorite way of having fun。😊。

Time is limited， so to have an abundance of these needs filled。

 you'll have to set your life up in a way that you can maximize the time you have to get these needs fulfilled。

Personally， I save a lot of time by having a team of assistants that I could pay to do a lot of work for me。

 and I have a personal trainer that helps me maximize my fitness goals so that I could make the most of my time in the gym。

 and I set goals for myself on a daily basis that I can achieve to help me feel accomplished。😊。

This way， there is some time left over once my physiological safety。

 belonginginess and esteem needs are all satisfied。

 and I make sure to use that time to do the things I find enjoyable。😊。

If you have an abundance of your other needs filled and you have taken time out of your day to enjoy yourself doing something。

 much like you would take time out of your day to work or to go out to a nightclub。

 then you could start doing the things that you actually enjoy doing。You have time for it now。

As a consequence， you will find yourself remembering to have sincere fun in the nightclub as well。😊。

What can anyone take away from you if you're already abundant in all the areas that we had covered。

When you realize this， you've reached a frightening level of freedom。

And when you're free and can have a lot of fun， other people will be excited about that fun as well。

We will be getting to having sincere fun in the actual club in a moment。

 but we have to start the foundation。If you are not enjoying your life as it is。

 then you will not have fun in the nightcl as well。Now let's shift over to the other question。

 how do you start enjoying the things that you are already doing？

You may have all your other needs fulfilled， and you may be doing the things you consider fun。

 But how come you can't seem to remember that have sincere fun。

We have reached a point where it is a matter of interpretation。

 where you need to realize that the things you do are already enjoyable。Strategy 1。

 your brain needs proof， not promises。What proof not promises means is that your brand will need to see and feel results before it can be confident to making a risk of some sort。

This is a direct consequence of the brain making conclusions about the world absent of any other information。

When you provide it with real world information， it could see what the real risk actually is。

 or in our case， the lack thereof。It needs proof that doing something that is actually enjoyable does not present any risk。

I outlined what I consider to be the ultimate solution to approach anxiety in commandment 3。

 That being one， your brain needs proof， not promises。

2 all negative feelings stem from a fear of death。3， you will not die from talking to a girl。4。

 when you talk to a girl， your lack of death will thus inspire you to go talk to another。😡，5。

 repeat this， and you will find that it's very easy to feel like going to talk to another girl。

Death can be defined by the loss of needs we covered before， physiological， safety。

 belonging and esteem。A severe loss of belonging or esteem needs might lead to suicide。

The feeling that you are not worth it or that you are not useful or that nobody loves you simply means that you need to go and find a way to replenish your belonginginess and esteem needs。

 The same way that you would go drink water if you are thirsty。

 E food if you were starving or seek shelter if there was danger。If you are feeling suicidal。

 you'll need to restore feelings of belonging and feelings of accomplishment。 There exist 1。

800 hotlines that have experts at helping people with this and getting you back on track。

 Call those before doing anything else。😊，In fact， the way the brain processes feelings of shame。

 embarrassment and guilt simply indicates to you that you are about to lose your social resources very soon or that something bad will happen very soon。

 Don't be fooled in the modern world， you'll face neither。

 but you need proof of this by going into these situations and seeing for yourself。

 Not promises that everything will be just fine。In your first 30 days of going out。

 you are going to have to face these feelings of shame， guilt and embarrassment。

But you can quite easily protect yourself against them in two ways。

 One is having an abundance of social resources on your own， your own tribe， your own community。

 and the other is to see through real life experience that literally nothing changes when you go talk to a pretty girl and she doesn't like you。

After these first 30 days， you will find yourself quite excited to approach a new woman because there is nothing to lose。

 only something to gain。When you're going out for even longer。

 you'll find that the marginal value of meeting another woman is so low that you don't really feel that there's much to gain at all or even that much at stake。

In other words， nothing to win， nothing to lose。Strategy，2， for enjoying the things you already do。

As an exercise again。Write down 20 things that you are grateful for。Then for each of these 20 things。

 vividly imagine what life would be like without them。Maybe you can't think of 20 things。

Consider small things you are grateful for instead。

The smaller or more insignificant these 20 things might be， the more they might matter to you。

For example， I may not really think too much about my legs or my hips。

But I imagine that people who have been in serious car accidents who feel slight pain every time they take a step。

They will have to endure that pain for the rest of their lives。

Or consider people who are not able to go out to nightclubs right now。

 either because they are shut down or there is some serious societal problem going on right now。

The only people that have the slightest inkling of what freedom actually is happens to be the people who have had it taken from them。

Look again at these 20 things and imagine your life without them。

It is quite hard to not celebrate being alive when you are grateful for these and other things。

Strategy 3 for enjoying the things you are currently doing， the flow state。

Regarding enjoying the things that you are currently doing。

 what if the perceived challenge of a task in front of you is just too high or if your perceived skill level is just too low。

It's not so fun to write a paper when it seems extraordinarily difficult to put it together or to take a girl home after meeting her earlier that night。

The strategy for both of these is identical and can be applied to anything that you don't enjoy doing。

Both do the following。1。Simplify the challenge in front of you to smaller pieces。2。

 improve your skill set for these simplified challenges。And 3。

Give yourself a consistent stream of positive feedback for having completed these challenges。

Suppose you want to write 1 hundred page paper on say different types of wine。

That would be very difficult to do。But what you can do is spend 40 pages on white wine。

40 pages on red wine and 20 on other types of wine。Maybe each of those is too difficult to do。

 Maybe break down the 40 pages down to a brief history， The different styles within each category。

 the different regions， perhaps even the most popular brands。

Is much easier to collect some information on these individually than it is as a whole。 By the end。

 you might have found yourself having written 10 20 page paper instead。

Look at what we've been doing with pickup。 We have broken it down to the very basic pieces。

 the very basic muscles， and working on them each individually。From there。

 you can quite slowly but effectively build up the skill set to a level that is probably much higher than you had previously anticipated。

When you consistently practice each of these smaller things。

 not only are you making the perceived challenge easier。

 but you are improving your perceived skill set overall。

The final piece here is to give yourself consistent feedback。

 When you give yourself positive feedback for having completed your challenges。

 that is what builds self esteem。You are provingrov to yourself your own self worth over and over by setting and completing goals that you have set for yourself。

 And again， if the goal is too difficult， you simply break it down into smaller goals and then you accomplish each one of those。

You might think that you do not need to give yourself positive feedback for doing something that that might be for children or that you yourself don't need it。

But something really important happens when you add this final element that is a consistent stream of positive feedback。

When you are involved with an activity with a clear set of goals and progress。

 one where the perceived challenge of the task can be handled by your perceived skill level at that same task。

 and you have a consistent stream of clear and immediate feedback。

 You shift into a state of consciousness called F， which is a concept discovered by positive psychologylogist and author of the book F。

 the psychology of optimal experience。 Miha Chient Miha。😊。

Do yourself a favor and look up the flow state graph。

You can visually see how the balance of perceived challenge and perceived skill induces the flow state In the pickup community。

 This is more commonly known as state。Flow is the experience where you are at your peak， Op。

 self actualized condition。Many veteran players know what this is。

 but it is a feeling where time seems to fly by。 You could say exactly what you want to say when you want to say it。

 And it is all the funniest shit in the world。In fact。

 you can oftentimes just go up to a girl in front of you and just look at her and she'll look back and be turned on immediately。

In fact， when you are in the flow state， you don't have to think about having fun or being funny。

 You just are。The great delusion about state in this community is that you have to be in state if you expect to talk to a grow or have any success。

Derek used to see these guys who would go out the clubs with these dark sunglasses on and just stand there and say that they were getting into state。

In fact， just by how I describe the above， you have to start taking action first before state can happen。

 Motion creates emotion。Remember what I said at the start of this commandment。

 a physiological change in your body is what makes the fun。Don't expect to be in state to have fun。

 It is an added bonus when it comes your way。As a summary of this strategy。

 learn to enjoy the game by making the challenge easier， improving your skill set。

 and then giving yourself a consistent stream of positive feedback。

I've talked at great length and Commandments 1 through5 on building your game up from scratch。

 how to apply each of these commandments to what you do。

I'll remind you that you have to build on each of these incrementally so that you are not even thinking about them。

 They just happen。 Otherwise you'll overcomplicate the whole system。Let's review the previous steps。

 They are start talking to girls within the first hundred seconds of being in the club or right away。

See the girl。 then declare yourself。 Okay， it's definitely gonna happen。 F my feelings。

 It's just a girl。 I'm the shit。 no pressure at all。 open like you mean it。 Go， go， go， go， go， go。

 go and then relax。 Hey， you're pretty girl。 I want to come say hi， I'm Travis。 What's your name。

Then start speaking the first thing that comes to your mind， completely trusting yourself。

 speaking with the frame。 We're already on the same team。

 There's a million dollar chuck in my back pocket。 There's nothing to win， Nothing to lose。

 You got a 10000 personality。The next three muscles will incorporate will be developing。

 remembering to have sincere fun。It might come as a surprise you。

 but these next two elements do not happen on the inside of the interaction。

 They happen in between your interactions。The first muscle to develop is giving yourself positive feedback。

You're already given yourself permission to fail and to trust yourself to speak honestly from the top of your head。

 which means that the interaction may go great or it may go badly。Here's what I ask of you。

No matter what， you will give yourself positive feedback。Great job getting in there。

 Great job speaking honestlyly。 Great job persisting。 Or if you did none of those things。

 Just great job for trying or great job overall。😊，It doesn't matter how。

 but in 100% of your interactions， when they are done， give yourself positive feedback immediately。

 positive feedback。Your initial thought might be No， it was awful or no， I'm embarrassed。 No。

 that was weak。This is why the positive feedback muscle must be worked on you have to train your perceptual muscles to make positive interpretations of you taking action。

Giving positive feedback towards yourself should become an instinct。 Great job。 Awesome job。

10 out of 10。😊，I want you to completely avoid negative feedback here。

 We discuss how to learn from negative feedback in the field report section in commandment 4。Again。

 all negative feedback does is just get you stuck in your head。In this area with success with women。

 when you give yourself only positive feedback， you start filling yourself with a positive emotion and a positive outlook on the world。

When you could do that， and when that becomes an instinct， you can actually start enjoying yourself。

Your first couple of tries is giving yourself positive feedback for every single interaction。

 You'll find yourself wing in and waning out of trusting that positive feedback。 When that happens。

 focus in again on the positive of the interaction。😊。

You'll have to bring your brand back to it every time you find yourself coming out of it。

You may not see this working in the first couple of days， but applied consistently。

 you'll end up finding yourself quite encouraged to taking a lot of action many days from now。

The next muscle is seeking out consistent feedback。

This muscle is meant to be combined with the previous one that being give yourself positive feedback。

You may have heard the phrase minimize time between interactions。

 What this succeeds in doing is giving you a momentum by simultaneously preventing you from getting in your head and getting you into a talking mood where it feels more normal to be inset than by yourself。

I find that the instruction minimizing time between interactions is more accurately described as seeking out new interactions for a consistent stream of feedback。

 which is summed up in this particular muscle you have to build。

 which is simply seeking out consistent feedback。What engaging this muscle should feel like is you are actively getting into set for the sake of giving yourself that positive feedback for doing so you're basically rushing in so you can start giving yourself that feedback and you're wasting no time by getting into that next set so you can yet again give yourself that positive feedback so that you can make that stream of feedback consistent which is necessary to get into the flow state。

The flow state becomes unlocked under three conditions。 One。

 when you're involved with an activity with a clear set of goals in progress，2。

 when the perceived challenge of the activity is only slightly more difficult than your perceived skill with engaging that activity。

 And 3， when you have clear and immediate feedback。😊。

The way this looks is that in order to start enjoying yourself。

 you'll want to get a consistent stream of this positive feedback。

 the very positive feedback that you give to yourself when you go into an interaction。

If for nothing else， the first women you talk to in a nightclub when you get there might just be for the sole purpose of giving yourself that positive feedback from every single interaction to kickstart the flow state。

In other words， you are functionally using these interactions no matter how they go。

 so that you can give yourself positive feedback for having gone up in the first place。

The depth of this seeking behavior that is seeking consistent feedback。

 even though essentially it is feedback you're giving yourself， goes very deep。

Neuroscientist Yak Pnkep sought to understand the evolutionary underpinnings of emotion。

He identified three different emotional circuits in the brain。They are called play， grief， fear。

 rage， lust， care and seeking。Certainly， you have experienced all of these other emotions。

 but why is there an emotional circuit called seeking。

It is the emotional circuit that says when you need something， you should go and find it。

When you are hungry， you should seek out food。 When you are lonely。

 you should seek out companionship。If you didn't have this seeking emotional circuit。

 you would simply die because you didn't go out into the world to go get the things you need。

You engage with the seeking circuit by choosing to proactively seek things out。

 It is important to remember that you can activate the circuit by going to seek things out。

The grve circuit， which is a depressive circuit， actually turns off the seeking circuit。

 but you can override the grve circuit by seeking out positive experiences elsewhere。

This is why oftentimes going for a run or even going for a walk outside can be enough to cure a depressive episode。

If seeking is curtailed at all， That being something gets in the way of that seeking circuit。

 then the rage circuit is activated。This explains why men who are rejected by women will often grow angry because they are standing in the way of their goal。

As a side note， anytime you do get angry， understand that the reason this happens is because there is simply something in your way of achieving a goal。

You can objectify this emotion of anger by identifying the thing that is in the way of achieving your goal。

For example， if you're angry because a car horn is going off outside。

 then a car horn is in your goal of， say， not being annoyed。

Or if you're angry at someone for having a belief， that might be in the way of your goal of connecting with that person。

In fact， if a girl gets angry at you at all， you might be in the way of helping her achieve her own social goals that evening。

😡，Nothing to take personal。One of you might get angry at a woman because they are turning you down。

You are letting them get in the way of your goal。A better goal to have and a better strategy to set than seeking out positive feedback from the women is to seek out positive feedback from yourself by giving yourself positive feedback via the strategies I have just outlined。

This way， the only person who could get in the way of you achieving your goal is you。Remember。

 the need to speak honestly must be greater than the need for the interaction to work。

The third muscle is to find something amusing out of the interaction。

This is also a muscle to work on because it is another one of interpretation。

 and most of your interpretations are automatic。This is about sharpening your sense of humor and how you see the world。

 This is how you strengthen your frame。What are things might be funny or amusing from the interaction。

Sometimes this is easy。 She literally turned down the best thing that could have happened to her that night。

 Maybe she can't handle the awesomeness。Or。They all started yelling in Spanish when I said they looked like they were immigrants。

This is what you just naturally find funny。But other times， this is harder。

Maybe you just got slapped， or you were just kicked out of your favorite club。

Or maybe you were embarrassed in front of a lot of people。

Start training yourself to find a humor after each of these interactions。

Maybe the funny thing is she couldn't actually slap you because you had a beard on。

Or maybe the funny thing is that people you got embarrassed in front of probably all make below average income。

Or maybe it's funny you're worried about one club when there are literally dozens of others in your local area。

Train yourself to find a humor。 At the start， you'll find it very hard to find a humor。

 Maybe there is nothing truly funny。You have to find something。 You have to practice。

 You could find something amusing in literally every interaction。The better you can do this。

 the more each interaction will be a stepping stone to a more enjoyable interaction than the next one。

😊，Let's put these together at the end of every single one of your interactions。

 when you give yourself positive feedback for every interaction。

 seek out consistent feedback and find something funny out of each interaction。😊。

You will see that every single interaction serves as kindle in your fire that will build your emotional state。

 You will find your emotions getting quite high if you are rapidly applying this process to every girl you talk to。

😊，You will quite automatically find yourself having fun in no time。

 all while simultaneously avoiding the obstacles of being discouraged while doing this because you are in complete control of what you do。

 complete control of your own feedback and complete control of how you interpret all these interactions。

If you are still speaking honestly and trusting the words at the top of your head。

 you will find that the words that are coming out are shifting from cold and logical get to know you type of conversations to heated and emotional。

 gutt busting， hilarious conversations， because we have cleared out all the obstacles in the way of allowing that natural enjoyment。

 happiness and fun to emerge from inside you。😊，Note， you will not get this right away。

 and for reasons mentioned before， you will likely not enjoy your first 30 days of going out。However。

 you should be really excited because this process will provide you a reliable process on remembering to have sincere fun。

😊，You now have a couple of macro strategies for this commandment。

 Start getting the rest of your life in order。 physiological needs， safety needs。

 social needs and self esteem needs。Let Derrek's elite lifestyle guidebook be your guide。

Make sure you are dedicating time to doing the things you enjoy doing the things that you want to do。

Prove to your brain that you have the abundance in other areas of your life by taking massive action and talking to women。

Be grateful for what you do have in your life already。

Make things that are very difficult and daunting， easier to accomplish by breaking them down into simpler challenges。

After your interactions， build these muscles， giving yourself positive feedback。

 quickly seeking out consistent stream of this positive feedback that you're giving yourself and finding something amusing from each interaction。

😊，Now， how do you consciously have sincere fun within your interactions。

 We will cultivate two more muscles， and these happen in the interaction。

 Those are self amusement and dark hum。Self amusement is a highly sought after skill set in the game。

It is a most honest indicator to a woman that you don't need her at all。 You're willing to walk away。

 that you are providing all of the value。 And as a result。

 she is emotionally attracted because she wants to feel how you are feeling。

After establishing all the elements I discussed above。

 we have set fertile grounds for self amusement。He might have discovered self amusement if he took the time to answer the three sacred questions exercise。

Here's an exercise for you to develop self amusement。 This is gonna rock。

Let me briefly take you back to the year 1654。 Sc and philosopher Blalaze Pascal claimed that all humanity's problems stem from man's inability to sit quietly in a room alone。

Remember how I said in commandment 1， There are no problems， only situations。

 because all the problems you create are the ones in your own head。Well。

 we're going to test Pascal's hypothesis right now。This exercise is simple。

 sett a timer for one hour， and do nothing。That's right， nothing。

This will be either the easiest or hardest exercise you will ever do。Just do nothing。

You can't be on your phone， You can't watch TV。 you can't read a book。 You can't take a nap。

 You can't go for a walk outside。 You can't go explore something。 You can't even meditate。

Just actively do nothing。Be in your room。 You're free to walk around or sit。

 but just do nothing one hour。What you'll notice is that you'll become incredibly bored。

 And as a response to this， your brain will start finding ways to entertain itself。

Pay attention to the ways in which you are able to enjoy yourself in this state。

 despite the complete lack of stimulation。Boredom is the beginning of every authentic act。

 Bom opens up the space for new engagements without boredom， no creativity。😊，If you are not bored。

 you just stupidly enjoy the situations you're in。Remember this feeling。

Self amusement is something that starts as a feeling。

 much like the feeling you have with this exercise by the end of these 60 minutes。

Let's make a little shift Now， after your opener， you are trusting yourself and speaking honestly of what is on your head。

 This is the bread and butter of your interaction。Here's a tool you can add to your arsenal after you open。

 start amusing yourself。You're still trusting the words that come to your head。

 but you are shifting your intention to amusing yourself to self amusement。Note。

 you are not amusing yourself as a technique， nor amusing yourself in order to amuse the girl。

 Your ultimate goal is to amuse yourself and raise your own emotions in this way。Furthermore。

 the girl will be looking in your eyes to see if you're there because you're just having a good time or if you're trying to get something from her。

 So it's important to be sincere in amusing yourself with the things you and maybe only you will find funny。

Your goal here is to pump up your own emotions。In other words。

 even though you are still trusting and speaking the bluntly honest words that come to your head。

 no matter what they might be， you are shifting your overall intention to self amusement。

 How to make yourself laugh， how to entertain yourself。😊，The other practices we have been covering。

 like what to do in between interactions will make this easier。

 but let me cover some elements of humor that might help you out。Scott Adams。

 the cartoonist who writes all the Dilbert comic strips。

 realized there was a formula to what makes something funny。Specifically， the formula is this。

You need at least two of what he calls the six dimensions of humor， those being clever， naughty。

 cute， bizarre， cruel， recognizable。Clever simply means you recognize clever when you see it。

 It's just combining things that people didn't think were going to combine， but yet。

 you somehow made it work。Naughty， naughty is usually just sex jokes or bathroom jokes。

Cute is something that usually involves children or animals。

Bizar just means two things that are out of place or two things that don't belong next to each other。

 like chainsaws and candle factories， or glow sticks and Nazis。Cruelty is a staple in humor。

 Cruel just means something bad happened to someone or you said something unkind to someone else。

 You know， cruel when you see it。Recognizable humor usually requires that you recognize something about the subject of the joke being like an experience you have。

 Many comedians will start their jokes with common situations that people see all the time。

 Something you recognize This is also what makes callback humorour work。Combine 2，3 or all  six。

 And you have something that's funny。Automatically。

 Derek has the elements of cruel and cute in most of his communications because he is oftentimes insulting some socialist or a political agenda or some cultural group。

 all while wearing some variety of a cat T shirt。You're not going to sit down and invent things to say that have all these elements。

 but when you're talking with a girl， pay attention to these six elements and call them out just to amuse yourself。

Clever， naughty cute， bizarre， cruel， recognizable。

As a demonstration of the bizarre elements of humor， Try this exercise。

 psychoylogists have a test called the impmplicit association test。

 where they present you with a word。 And you have to say the first word that comes to your head when you hear it。

 For example， if they say blue， you might say ocean， or if they say guitar， you might say strange。

Instead， say a word that is completely unrelated to that word。

This will induce the bizarre element of humor where we see two things out of place。

So when someone says blue， you sayBana。Or if someone says guitar， you say feces。Every now and then。

 one other element of humor will sneak its way in， like you saw in the previous example。

 which might give you a little giggle。You could do this with your wing where he says one word。

 and you say another word that is completely unrelated。

Or you can do this on your own just to give it a try where you just say a string of words where each word is not related to the previous one。

If you really want to entertain yourself， just go up to a girl in the nightclub and just say a string of words in the same way as above where each one is unrelated to the previous one。

You'll be shocked at how often they'll stop what they're doing and just listen。

You can even use this when there is a lull in your conversation。

 Just say a string of unrelated words like cat， pineapple， machine gun， women's rights。

She'll look at you and just start laughing and ask。

 what are you even saying or even repeat some of the words that you're already saying。

Be aware of these general elements of humor in your conversations。 Clever， naughtty， cute， bizarre。

 cruel， recognizable。Keep speaking exactly the words there at the top of your head。

 but shift your intention towards self amusement， towards entertaining yourself in the ways that you enjoy most。

Last but not least， the final muscle to cultivate is dark humor。

Dark humor is a style that makes light of a subject matter that is generally considered taboo。

 particularly subjects that are normally considered serious or painful to discuss。Why dark humor。

 you might ask， It's because very attractive girls love dark humor。In fact。

 it is a great screening mechanism for attractive women because lower quality women will oftentimes be turned off by it。

A few months ago， I joined my older brother for Quizo at a local bar。

 which is just a trivia competition where if you get the most points。

 you get like a coupon to an olive garden or something like that。

Each team gets to give themselves a name that the M。 C has to announce before announcing the course。

 So people will have names like the Red team or the Chicago rock stars。

Since this was around the time that the infamous sex offender， Geoffrey Epstein。

 debaably committed suicide。 So we decided to call our team the Gerey Epstein Gentleman's Club。

This is dark humour at its finest for obvious reasons and gave everyone in the bar a collective groan and a single fuck you from one of the other teams。

Notes that not everyone is happy about this joke。Later on。

 one of the team members's girlfriends walks in about halfway way through the competition。

 She is absolutely gorgeous When the Ms announces， and in second place。

 the Gerey Epstein Gentleman's Club， she actually started crying from laughing so hard。😊。

I haven't yet figured out why， but it's only particularly attractive girls that think this humor is hilarious。

😊，Dark humor is a rare type of fun and is extraordinarily compelling。

 And when you find a girl that is into it， she knows that this is a different type of interaction。😊。

Deerk loves to say obnoxious Saintints to get the bamby eyes and the attention of a girl。

To cultivate this， look back again the commandment too and some of the darker aspects of your own personality。

Ask yourself how you conveyed these aspects in a humorous way and write these down。Personally。

 I'm quite fascinated with the psychology of serial killers。 So oftentimes。

 I'll discuss some of the common everyday problems they have to face。

 like whether to use a chainsaw or a hacksaw or if they molest their victims before or after killing them。

 among other things。Humor is a great vehicle for revealing some of these things about yourself。

 and you do this by finding the humor in some of these darker or more taboo realities。

Dererick has an exercise we do on boot camp。 If an entire country of people had to die or if your entire family was brutally molested by the Tom Mule。

 what country would you pick to die。And then， explain why。This taps into some of your own personal。

 darker tendencies。 If you have taken ownership of these tendencies。

 you'll find yourself bringing up the bad boy in yourself more often。

Incorporate this into your conversations by expanding the blunt honesty of the words you say to include some of your darker。

 more taboo and more offensive beliefs and opinions。

Cultivate the muscles of self amusement and the muscles of dark humor。Before ending this commandment。

 remember this is all just a game。 You might be embarrassed。 You might be ashamed。

 but it's all in good fun because it's all just a game。 It's called the game， not the suffering。

 Not the pain and not the reckoning。 It's a fucking celebration。 I mean。

 are we really talking about navigating the night club。 like it's a battlefield。

 This is a place and time to celebrate。 People will want to join your fun。

 They want to feel like you。 This part of your life needs to get handled。

 but don't stress about it so much。 If it doesn't work out。

 you could still go order a pizza and everything is all good。 This is not life or death。

Go build something and get the girl in the mean。 Daytime is for heavy lifting and hard work at the club。

 It's tity time。 Or if you're a nas guy， then it's booty time。Or whatever else you're into。

 It's time for that。Derek and Owen used to play this game with each other where they would feed each other crazy and bizarre openers。

 And their challenge was they had to use them and make them work。

Invent fun games for yourself in your way to go play while at the club。

 The club time is about you and having a good time and sharing that good time with a couple pretty girls。

 So go out to the club and remember to have sincere fun。😊。
