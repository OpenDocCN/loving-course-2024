# 33、谜男2.0：第一章：(#1) Lisbon- An Evening with Mystery & Beckster - Masterclass Bootcamp Bundle

Just quickly to tell you， before you start this segment。

 get a notepad or something to write on because you're gonna build a cheat sheet。

 What is a cheat sheet。 It's got all the stuff that you w to practice tonight。

So after youve watch this， go out and apply it。It is a pleasure to be here， really， truly a pleasure。

 We have some knowledge that we're going to upload into your head from our heads。😊。

Knowledge that once you integrate into your life will improve your game。

 Does that sound of interest to you。 All right， good。 So we're in the right place then。

You guys are gamers， proactive gamers。 You're going out in field。

 Is this predominantly day game or night game。Day game and night game。 Well。

 let me introduce to you a day gamer and a night gamer。 This is Beexer。开班。是。

Bexter and I have traveled the world。 We've been to 66 cities according to Facebook。

 So we've done over 100 boot camps together。 my wingman， I've known him for 11 years， and he is。

 in my opinion， one of the best talented pickup artists that I've ever seen。

 And I've had a chance to go around the world and meeting fellow pickup artists。

 likeminded individuals that are really， truly into this game。

 So that is hopefully a true and real big up for my friend here。

 So any information that comes out of our our mouths are right from infield。

 We've been in field gaming hardcore。Pretty much nonstop for the last several months。

 if not for the last several years。We're in field， where have we been most recently？

We've been to Helsinki， Y Helsinki where my girlfriend is from Sna。Hi， everyone。I'm Russia。

And Russia， specifically St Petersburg， we've gained there。 and also in Moscow。

 We've heard stories that those cities are particularly replete with beautiful women。

 and we can confirm that is true。 You guys are practicing for traveling。

Turn your girlfriend into a travel partner like I've done。It's a really great game plan。

To start small by saying， let's go get some gum together。And turn the girl that you've just met。

Into a travel partner。So you're instantly living together in an Airbnb in a new city。

That is one of the， the top pieces of advice I can give you immediately is we need to form game plans when drawing women into our lives。

 and we have a whole myriad of game plans。 First off， who needs a translation。

 Does everyone understand English， O， Is it who who needs translation。No hands。 Okay， perfect。

 Otherwise， we'd call someone enough to assist， right， just to get it， get us through fair。

 Maybe there's someone that didn't understand That's true。I。😊，good， very good。Where do we begin。

 There's a lot to talk about。 Yeah， it's interactive because it's a smaller group。

 So it's interactive。 But so feel free to ask questions at any point。

 if you don't understand the way to do that is just put your hand up and we'll get to you。😊，Fair。

I think we should start off with something I've been thinking about quite a lot and a lot。

 ideal in high energy quite a lot。 but I can do low energy if need be。

 And one of the things people are worried about is going out because they lose energy。

 put your hands up if you fit you're always thinking I'm gonna to lose energy。 It's really tiring。

 going out all the time。Okay， fair。There's a little trick you can con yourself into。

 Yeah You can con yourself into having more energy and go throughout the whole night。

 There's a trick that David Blaine did。 It's called Ching。😊，And chunk is， I call it power hour。

 So you， I'm just gonna get out for one hour。 I'm gonna make it really effective。

 And I'm gonna work on two things。 Maybe it's keynote。Maybe it's telling D H V stories。

 So if you say I'm just gonna go out for one hour。 But when you're out and that hour passes。

 you can say to yourself。 And by that time， you should be having fun because you've been in set enough。

😊，And you've done your free warm upset and go， I'll do another hour and then another hour。

 and I do it all the time。 to us the time。 And then we end up going home at 5 in the morning。

But it starts with just committing one hour to the game。

It shouldn't take more than an hour if it's even at the end of the night。 you know。

 a club is only open for 30 more minutes。 Is it worth going in in the first place， I'd say， yeah。

 it is。 It's worth going in and doing three sets。 You can get three sets done in 30 minutes。

In an hour， you can get three sits done very easily。

If you have one hour of time to get three sets done， three or four sets， if it's three sets。

 it's one every 20 minutes。And imagine having four hours of training deciding。

 I'm going to get good at my material first。 Then I'm going to go after women later。

 I'm going to meet lots of women， but I'm going to fall in love with my material first before I fall in love with the girl。

That way， you will be able to meet the universe halfway with a skill set。

 I think we're all on that page already。 You realize that there's a skill set to be developed。

 And then once you have that developed， then you can meet the universe and start gaming and you'll clean house。

start with an hour。You don't have to go for four hours。

 although that's the newbie drill where you go out four hours。10 PM till 2 AM。 Exp time。

Play three sets an hour。One every 20 minutes on average。

And what if a set only lasts one minute where you got 19 more minutes to wait until you have to open the next set anyway。

 So you have enough time in there to open a dozen sets。Who went out yesterday。Awesome， great。

 Were you smiling when you opened。Did you smile on the open？ We don't lose our power。

Did you open a dozen sets yesterday？I didn't open a dozen sets。

 I'm not doing a newbie mission anymore。 My sets run longer， and I merge my groups， but I've done。

 I'd say half a dozen sets。How many have done a dozen sets yesterday。You did。

 so you're gaming and congrats。 that's how you're going to steep your learning curve。

You improve dramatically by running actual real world sets。 That's where we get good。

 Who has done only three sets yesterday。3 sets。 but were they longer sets。 tend' say I' warm okay。

 quality problem even if I'm not interested in Fair， fair。 That's what style would do as well。

 He called it his quality problem。 Neil Strauss， the pickup artist is formerly known as style。

Change his name back。What he would fall into is his worm upset would stick。

And he would say it's better to have a bird in the hand than two in the bush。

But there is also another quality problem that he's dealing with there。

 and that is the fear of success。The enemy of the best is not the worst。

The enemy of the best is the good。You can be in a good situation。

 You could be with if you're so inclined to rating women from 1 to 10， which Id never do。 you could。

 You could be with an 8， and it'll preclude you from being with a 9。If you're with an  eight。

 justify myself okay， I'm dating。I consider her a fair， fair。

 I'm in a committed relationship with her。 So everything else is just bonus and gravy。

 I'm in a committed relationship as well。 We travel together。

 We've done at least a dozen boot camps now。And I do this for a few reasons。 I do it for sport。

To keep my training up， because I。Field if necessary。Facing the fact that I'm running boot camps。

 so I feel like I have to stay polished。But more so， I do it for demo。

I demonstrate how to open up a group of people， how to merge that group with other groups。

 and you need to be able to merge。In order to。You know， get the particular hot ones。 They're。

 you're going to find out that the hot girl， I'm presuming you want to date the hot girl of the room。

It isn't the first set that you enter that will stick。 It's the second set。The second set will stick。

The first set is building social proof so that you seem safe。And you look preselected by women。

 And then the other set will see that and be drawn to you。

 So remember that it's two sets that you're really after。

 You're opening two sets and merging them together。 If you go after one set here， you'll get nothing。

 You go after one set here， you get nothing。 But if you go after this set and this set and let them meet and merge the sets together。

 occupying all the obstacles。 Both groups， you get to isolate， in turn， your selected targets。

 they get to in meeting each other， build a jealousy plot line， a challenge is formed。

A pursuit is created。Where you're the prize and you get them both in turn。You you have your option。

 One of the golden nuggets in this that。I'd say，99% of people practicing pickup。

Don't do One of the golden nuggets is merge， merge sets。 Put your hands up if you merge sets。

It's something to do。 I should put my hand up to。 It's something to do。

 It's what are you going to do with the set now， How am I going to keep them titillated， entertained。

 captivated。 I can simply say， let's go make some friends。

And take the set I'm with and go open up a new set and demonstrate my social intelligence to the set I'm with。

 The next set will rip open because you already have girls with you。 You're safe。

 It's like a hot knife through butter。 Se will open。 If you've got girls with you。

 you get into clubs for free。 if you have girls with you， right， So yeah， that's my thought。

I's say another golden gone to my mic should there be a priority to a mixed group ors a group with a bunch of guys and you go to the group of guys for different reasons first it's going be easier second if you can demonstrate that with that kind an alpha then that certainly there I hear where you're coming from I think that and I have some knowledge in this area having open groups of people often in various cities around the world。

 I've been gaming quite strong the two of us。Guys are ugly girls。😀Yeah。You can open mix sets。

If there's a guy and a girl together。You can open them。If you open indirect。

You don't have to open with， wow， you're beautiful because that'll alienate the obstacle。

And you have to keep a two set together。 you can't isolate from a two set。So。

Will I go into a group with guys in them， Certainly， I will do that。

 Will I go into a group with all guys， Usually I'll get bombarded being mystery。

 I'll get bombarded by some pickup artist guys。 But。

 but we are generally respectful to each other's valuable time。

 So we make it short and sweet and then call it a cock farm and get out of there。 right， So。

Can you warm up that way and talk to all guys， Sure， a girl may come into when all guys set。

 and she may have gone to the washroom， but generally speaking。

 I'll work mixed sets with girls in them。I， I love female energy in， in my conversations。

 I was gonna to say， actually， one of the other golden nuggets that 99% of pickup eyes don't do。😊。

Is mixed sets。 Yeah， and it's shocking。 The girls， the girls can be really bored because they will have one guy or maybe two guys in the with them in a group。

 And they might be like three or four girls， let's say。

 but no one's approaching because there's a couple of guys in there。

 So they're just waiting for some guys to talk to him。 This four girls， two guys。 You know。

 at least a couple girls are going spare。So get in there， get in there and open those mixed sets。

 You'll be pleasantly surprised。 We've gone city to city doing this。

 opening mixed sets as long as you open indirect， where you're not hitting on the target on the open。

 You can't。 You're in a group。 You have to add value to the conversation。So it's。

Adding a topic of information， a topic of discussion that is interesting。

 That's what it's about getting the topic of discussion out there。 And guess what they open easier。

 Yeah， they're not harder。 Oh it's a guy。 It's harder。 No， it's easier。 and you you know。

 you make eye contact with a guy as you go in and then to the group。 The hottest girls are not alone。

 they're usually in groups。 So we have to as pickup artists as performing artists。 face that fact。

There are women who。Stand by themselves in front of a magazine rack。

 And some people have the fantasy of that's how you pick up a girl。

 I'm looking for the girl standing in front of the magazine rack by herself。

 And that's gonna to be my pickup。 She's never going meet my friends。

 I'm never gonna meet her friends。 It's already a weird pickup。 I want the girls in those magazines。

 And those girls are not alone。 They're in groups。 And they're in mixed sets。

 So let's face the dragon head on and strike its heart。 We're gonna be smiling。

 We're gonna be opening up a group of people。 And after a few minutes of。😊，Controlling that set。

 we're going to be saying， let's go make some friends。

 That's a forward merge or a backwards merge where you say。

 let me introduce you to some good friends of mine。

And you backwards merged to your previously open set。 That's normal。 I did that last night。

 I opened up a set， opened another set， merged them together， captivated the group for a while。

 took a couple of them， merged them back to hang out with some more girls。

 their safety and merging back to a group when you have females in there as well， females。

There's such a difference between this。 I think there are more similarities than differences among men and women。

 And I wanted to just highlight that we are all on the same sphere。

 even though you don't know who those people are in that group。 Why do I want to open them。

 I don't even know who they are。 They're wonderful people。 You have to。😊。

Use your game to draw out the wonderful qualities in others。 That's why it's an art form。

 We're out to turn this into fun for them。 It's not about us。 It's about them adding value。😊。

Agreed another thing， one， the one thing that we always get on boot camp that we have to tell people the most。

 What do you think it is one bit of advice。 That's also the easy easiest and immediate thing you can correct。

 straight away。 S， smileile， Sile， smile warm with the eyes。 You will not lose your male masculinity。

 your power。 You could be Joe Pessy with a gun。 But it's your birthday。 Sile big。😊。

We should be the smiling pickup artists， because I'm telling you。

 smiling will increase your chances of opening a set by about 300%。

 It's called a current emotional state opener。 When you open like this。

 the very first time that next girl that you open， who's gonna become your girlfriend sees your face。

 It should be with a smile。 Trust the smile。 It helps。😊。

Some of the most important things that we could say in the short time that we have， smile。

What about to the eyebrows so it's different when you smile。

 And when you smile and I'd say warm with the eyes， smile with the eyes to find that uniqueness。

 even if it's a fake smile， No， no， a real genuine。

 warm smile like you would to a kid a kid in an elevator。 if there was a baby in a trolley and're。😊。

You could be in a bad mood， but you're not going to lay your baggage on the kid。

 You're just gonna smile， right， That kind of warm smile is。

 is what I believe to be the most attentive， present to the moment type of smile that you can create。

 Yeah， don't bring your baggage to the club。 Don't bring your baggage to the club。😊，Nobody cares。

 So if you're tired， if you're in a bad mood， nobody cares。高洪。

There's one less guy to worry about in there。Right。Is it a point where you stop smiling？Certainly。

😀Yeah。You're talking about the American smile， ladies， looks like the party's over here。

So you're a nurse， tell me more。I。The American smile， I'd say the first half second。

 the second they see your face， the first time should be with a smile。

 and then show a rich range of emotion。 what we call a willingness to emote。

Throughout your storytelling。Throughout the timeline， from meat to sex， you're telling stories。

 and those stories should be captivating。You should be able to draw， well。

 first attract them around you and then captivate， lean forward and tell them a story that you have to tap everyone on the shoulder。

 all right， get this， did you hear about the Titanic？Some of you know that one， the Titanic opener。

 why do you say the American？Becauseuse it's a fake smile。 It's a fake smile。

 Have a genuine that's the smile you want。 You guys have great smiles。 That's it。 That's the cell。😊。

Isn't a woman more attractive if you see her first smiling。

She gains a pointer two because she's smiling。 She's not having her resting bitch face on right。

 But we have a resting bitch face as well。 If you're not smiling， then you're doing the opposite。

 you could be neutral and neutral can come off accidentally like anger。 They will judge。

 And is this what humans do when we meet other humans， We judge their current emotional state。

 Is he drunk。 Is he is he angry or is he blissfully happy because he just won the lottery or just got laid right。

 you can tell this on the open。 when you have someone bump into accidentally and you turn to face them and oh。

 hey smiling， taking pictures of girls， You don't get an adrenaline release。😊。

But if he wasn't smiling， and you was so。You're going to side on caution and think that he might be in a bad mood and you'll get adrenaline release。

 That's the last thing I want a woman to feel is a scary adrenaline release from the from my open。

 I want to open up incidentally。 I want the conversation to。Be instant。

Without the need for fearful emotions。Do all that， who would say they're a beginner。

 Put your hand off。Honest， that's good。 Any more， honest， people want to put their hands up yet。Good。

 how long have you been in field for？ How long have you been gaming for。get so。Two months， brand new。

 okay， congratulations man， you found the community。Just to catch you up to speed。

 the game takes about a year and a half to become great。 You have to game four nights a week。😊。

So that you can turn this into an art form。 You can become talented at this one particular skill set。

Picking up women is， in my opinion， an art form。 It's the pickup arts。 You are an artist。

 We're all artists。 We're pick artists。 You turn the pickup artist on when needed。

 turn it off when you don't need it。Pretty safe and honest。

 we men were going to be doing much of the picking up。

You don't need to pick up when you got the girl back home watching Netflix。

 There's no need to be running loads of routines That's exactly。 Yeah， watch's the movie。

But you do need to know how to pick up。So what can we do to help these gentlemen in the time that we have want to talk about the keys？

Why not？ Okay， let's run through quickly。 And then I can teach some openers and maybe some easy dance moves。

 And you don't need to be able to dance to do it。 Yeah， that's fun。 That sounds like a good idea。

 But the keys， the keys。 What I've done is I've deconstructed what I've taught over the years is we've taught now for how long。

😊，What together together， Well， we were together， were together 11 years。

 Yeah maybe 7 running through time， boot camps and so on。 We've done again，66 boot camps。

 boot camp cities together， according to Facebook。 which Well。

 we've done two tours already this year。 We did South America。 And this is 7 cities。

 Our end European tours。 So we're gonna end with you guys。 So that's awesome。😊，Yeah。

And what a great place to be。 Yeah， this is a wonderful place to train and practice and get your game up to speed for when you're ready to travel to places like Helsinki。

😊，You know， the hottest girls in Hollywood are from Finland。They're the tourists。

 the hottest girls that are in virtually every city are the tourists from Finland。

Finland is I'm biased， but Finland is。Just like Stockholm， Sweden。Swedish girls。

 it's a target rich city。Where just being there will floor you。

You have to don't tell anyone the secret。But all of us should become travelers。

To become good at game， you have to face the dragon head on and strike its heart。

Cold approach pickup is where it's at， opening groups is where it's at， opening the three set。

 two thirds of all approach scenarios are the three set， three people。You know。

 the guy and two girls， you have to get good at opening the three set and merging that set into other groups around。

 That is absolutely normal。 So what I've done is I've taken the last several years and I've broken down into what I think are the five most important。

Keys that we can help provide information for。These are the keys that if you focus on one at a time call one of them your big domino and you're going knock down this big domino。

 pick one of these to focus on your game is going to improve if you over time。

 once you've knocked down the first big domino， then the second big domino。

 you can work on knocking down， you get to these five keys and your game is going to improve dramatically。

 Are you ready for these five keys， the first key。Is structure。There is a structure to pick up。

 There are naturals， and then there are supernaturals。

Supernnaturals are the guys who have broken down pickup and found structure。

Have automated the structure， practiced this understanding that there is a narrative。

 a story that goes from meat to sex。And there are phases that you go through the phase。

 the first phase gets you to the second phase， gets you to the third phase。

 gets you to the fourth phase， and so on。 The objectives of each phase is to complete the phase and get to the next phase。

That the fact that there are phases。In。This structure of pickup is the first revelation is the first eye opener that there is a plot line from meat to sex that can either be one of two plots。

 Either the girl is chasing you or you're chasing the girl。

Those are the two plot lines that you can choose from。Which one's better in your opinion？

The girl chasing us。 So that's what the game plan is is all about。

 It's about structuring the opportunity to be pursued。

That is a much better game plan and the mystery method and what we teach together。

Presumes that's the plot line you prefer。Rather than us being manhandzy and me putting my hand on her knee only together to push it off。

 instead I take her hand put it on my knee。And say， is thereor to you the MeCI？

Getting her to chase you。Makes sense， see I can be the first to push her off hand。

 off my knee rather， and she will feel the void and the need to revalidate herself and she'll end up putting her hand voluntarily back on my knee。

And that has happened time and again， so I know that it's a real world truth。

Isn't that a better way of doing kno escalation， getting the girl to touch you rather than you touching her and getting rebuffed？

It's one step forward， two steps back。 You make a move on them when they feel some discomfort。

 you not only release from that move， but you do a takeaway。You say， let's rejoin our friends。

And you take away and walk first to another group， and then she joins you soon after following you。

You cannot be chaseste unless you structure the opportunity to be pursued。

If you walk up to the set and you just plant your feet there the whole time and you don't leave。

 you can't be pursued。You have to be the first to say， all right， slow it down speede Rar。

 Let's rejoin our friends and join another group and have her slowly but surely tag along。

 Now you can be chasesd。That's our game plan。 That's the best game plan， in my opinion。

 Let's be chased。 Let's become the prize。So again， the first。Key is structure。

There are three main stages to the structure。And it makes sense logically that we're going to be using our brains。

 It's like a game of chess this game。 So the first stage is attraction。

 We're going to get the person attracted to us。 We're going to trigger attraction。Also。

 in attraction， we're going to qualify them。 We're going to get them investing in us。

We're going to qualify them， ask them qualifying questions that when they invest in us。

 we reward them for the good behavior of doing so by giving them I Os。Indicators of interest。

So not only are we out to get them to give us indicators of interest in attraction。

 but we're out to give indicators of interest for validated reasons， for reasons they've said。

 not just for their anatomy。Not just because they're beautiful。That's attraction。Next comes comfort。

If you have attraction， she's willing to。Purchase some time with you to build comfort with you。

Some guys fall into comfort alone。 They， They get along with the girl for 10 minutes。

 and it leads nowhere。 Ha that ever occurred to you。It's because you're jumping over attraction。

 There's actual things to do to trigger attraction systematically to get indicators of interest from her for having done。

So you get attraction first， then you do comfort， and then she'll seduce you。

 It's attraction plus comfort equals seduction。I want to be pursued， so in attraction。

 I play the high valued male， I presume attraction。

AndIt's almost like a running joke throughout the entire pickup where I know she wants me。

 and I'm slowing her down。And she'll fall into that frame， I hold the frame， I create the frame。

 I hold the frame。And then we can go off into comfort。Once I have comfort， then we can do seduction。

 Does that ring true First attraction， then comfort， then seduction， some guys。Respectfully。

 they start at the end， who's opened in seduction， Who tried hands come up。 I've tried tried it， too。

 Of course。 But you end up with being the seducer。And you get instant buyer's remorse。

You get a lot of girls saying no， because you're coming in like direct game。

 you're showing interest on the open。So we don't want to start at the end。

 I see it like real life tinnder。 Do you like me。That's， that's seduction first。

 Some guys start with comfort first， but they're starting in the middle。

That's a problem in recognizing there is a logical structure here， they become the girlfriend。

They become the confidant。But there's no attraction。

There's just comfort that goes nowhere and there will be no seduction。

Because there has to be attraction for seduction， there has to be the balance。Right。

 then there are people who start at the beginning。 They do hit attraction。

 but then they compromise the woman's comfort levels by trying to seduce them right away。

 get him to the bathroom。If your girlfriend of two years won't have sex with you in a public bathroom stall。

 don't expect a quality girl you've just met to。And would you want to be your girlfriend afterwards。

You could do that later， but not a star， especially not not with the quality girl that you've just met。

 you want to turn her into your girlfriend rather than a one night stand。

 Some girls are worth keeping around。Right。If they're not worth keeping around。

 maybe you should up your standards。Raise your standards。

 Go after girls that you're really afraid to talk to。 F the dragon。 head on。 What is the dragon。

 beauty， grow accustomed to beauty。 Get desensitized to beauty。Grow accustomed to beauty。

 Know that it's out there， that there is a lot of beauty to， to face。

 Some people have a fear of failure。Other people have a worse fear。Fear of success。

Fear of the actual beauty that they're facing。Right， so the best way I can。Wrap around that。

Is to flood myself with experience。 go out to public gatherings where there is beauty。

 Leave your city if the city isn't hot enough。 This city is replete with with two types of girls。

 the natural， local， hot girls that make Lisbon a beautiful place to come to。 and also the。😊。

Traveling hot girls that come to a beautiful city like this to experience the culture。

So you've got two shots at finding love。In this city。The city， I believe， is great for training。

 especially for training， because everyone's so kind。

Conversations are generally kind if once you get into the hook point。Right。

People are genuinely good people here and youve got the street vibe with say it's like night game and day game mixed together。

 It's quite cool。Yeah， we love coming here。Lisbon is a beautiful place。 This is her second time here。

 in fact。So once again， structure is the first key。

There is a structure to the love story that you are creating。

 and that structure includes being chasesd。Fair。That's the first key。If you can。Get structured down。

 if you don't have it down， you can fall in love with the phases。

Then you're well underway to getting good at pickup。Fall in love with the phases。

The first phase is opening。The second phase is demonstrating higher value。

 The third phase is qualifying the girl。 The fourth phase is moving the set into a lock in position where you're seated with them if possible  five minutes in。

 and then you finish qualifying。Eight to 12 minutes for qualifying and then comes comfort building。

You need material， material is the second key。Material to convey your personality。

 Ma to fill the structure。Every phase， you need material to meet the objectives of the face。

For openers， like for A1， rather， the first phase of the model of the structure。Your opening。

It's called open。And what do we do， what tools do we have to make us meet the objectives of the phase。

 We use openers。We smile big on the end， but we have an opener， we initiate the conversation。

With an opener， a default opener， I recommend getting a default opener。

 If you don't know what to say。 If you're looking at the set， it's just arrived。

 You see a beautiful girl in in a three set， a four set。

 The difference between a three set and a four set， by the way， is talk louder。

If it's a five set talk even louder， keep that set together。

 tap everyone on the shoulder if necessary to keep that set together。Don't break the set apart。

 You don't need to。 Some people will talk to one guy。In a five set。

 talk to one dude and the others peel off and are talking to each other， you're not working the set。

 The target isn't in the person you're talking to。You're not going to disarm people one by one by one。

 it's called group theory for a reason， keep the group together。Right， so again。

 the second key is material to meet the objectives of the phases。 You need openers。

 You need the false time constraint。 I'll give you an example of a false time constraint。

Tucking a chair back in， acting as if you're about to leave。And then saying， oh， that reminds me。

 okay， one quick thing。And I come and sit down and join them again。

 I have demonstrated my willingness to walk away。 That is a false time constraint。

 You could also say， I only have a second。 I've got my friends here。

 That's a verbal false time constraint。 But it's a tool for an artist。 Use that to good health。

 It creates comfort。The girl will be more comfortable with your presence。

What else can we talk about material， It fills in the structure， fall in love with the phases。

We're going to open， we need openers。 We're going to demonstrate higher value。

 We need DHV or demonstrations of higher value， material or stories to tell。Have a few。

 have three openers， have three DHV stories， next comes qualifying。

 have three qualifier questions that you can rely on when you get nervous when it's necessary。

 hit the waypoints， hit your structure。With the material that you concot， do you guys have an opener。

 Do you use a default opener if if all hell goes to if all hits the fan， can put it that way。

 You've got a routine to abide by。Francisco， what's your routine， What's your opener， default opener。

Making a statement of where they're from， that's good。Yeah， I don't have anything else。 Okay， fair。

 I'll give you two quick ones that you can use straight away that are very effective。

 The first one is， you can set a go。Hey， you've got the second best shoes I've seen today。Right。

 why not the first。Why do we not do that。Cause it's a compliment straight away， but second best。Yeah。

 push pull and then what does she say？W was which the last， sorry， which one for the last mine。😀Okay。

 she laughs。 It's good that you laugh。 It means you've got sincere humor to go of your looks。😊。

I'm Rob。 Who the hell are you。From that condition I've seen him do that。

More than once to to because he uses multiple openers。 We。

 we have five openers that we default to regularly。 You'd think， oh， your mystery。 You know。

 you should have like 100 openers。 No， I stick to above 5， but I do them very well。

5 openers is all you need。3 openers will get you to opening a set and being able to merge forward and backwards。

 You got three openers there。 So you need 3000。 Yeah。

 we have our default ones that we've honed and got the delivery down on。

 Make sure you have a default opener。Who's got the best shoes on tonight？

I've got I've got what's in your belly， what's in your belly， I got double sddy eagerger in my belly。

You know what it's doing， it's making love in my bellyet。

Current emotional state is conveyed on the open by doing that。Rather than ladies。

Looks like the party's over here。That doesn't work。 Being like James Bond。 James Bond is too serious。

 It doesn't work。97% of women want a man to have a sense of humor。

 So coming in with a current emotional state of nonneing， nonthreatening， playful。

 that is going to help assist you in opening sets。 Don't bring your baggage to the club。

 Your default should be comedy and fun and humor。 if if they're not laughing。

 you're doing something wrong。If the girls are laughing， not at you， but with you。

If you've got laughter happening， you know that the pickup is working right I'。

Lots of pickup artists around the world with varying degrees of proficiency。

And the best ones create laughter。 Just knowing that should already set you at ease going， okay。

 so the pickup is supposed to be fun。 It's not It doesn't have to be fun for you。

 although it is a lot of fun for us。😊，But it does have to be fun for the girls。

 It's less about logicing them to death， as it is about playing with their current emotional state and getting them laughing and smiling and enjoying your company。

😊，So once again， the first key is structure。 Learn it。

 I've written a book called the Mystery methodthod， How to get beautifulut Women into bed。 Find it。

 It's free online。 You'll find the P D F of it。 Read that like the。

Your future kids lives depend on it。It defines structure。 It goes into the structure of a pickup。

 Second key， again， is material to fill in the structure。

 give pointer pleasem sorry So but in this case， you have already been in other relationships。

 You know， girls for a lot of time。 Okay， what when you tell a story。

 I always need to find new stories and Sure， sure， what principles do you stick to when you are telling a good story not over and over again。

 different stories constantly Okay。I do have an answer for it， and it happens to be the third key。

The second key is material， we all know what that is to meet the objectives of the phases。

 the third key。Is delivery。How to deliver a good story。

And some people have a problem in more than one key。Some people don't have structure。

 so they don't know what they're doing in field。 They have no game plan。

 They don't know about merging sets， and they don't know about locking into groups， right。

You got people that have not enough material。That could be part of the problem， right。

 but delivery of that material really is where it all comes together in field。Right。

 so what delivery points do we have， Well， I think in delivery。

 how did you get good at delivering something。PaPracice live in field practice。

Your field is the mirror。You don't have to go in front of a mirror and practice in front of a mirror until you get your stories together。

 look in the mirror and touch up and smile and say I love you too right do that。 That's fine。

 But practice your material in field。 you simply can decide tonight's a practice night。

 I'm gonna to practice on a dozen sets tonight because in the future。

 a woman of particular quality is gonna come along。

 I want to have the skill set together right so you have to match your skill set with the challenge。

This word。Deviating from delivery， though， the third key is delivery。Talking slow。

How you pace yourself， tonality， inflection。I'll play into it。So。This won't。

 This doesn't help your question of three years。 I don't know what to do in three years。

 I'm only two years in。We'll tell you in a we'll tell you in a year because I don't focus on relationship management。

 It's something that I've just decided not to focus on relationship management instead to focus on courtship from meat to beginning a sexual relationship is my focus。

 And then once you've got your girlfriend， then you can go read books on relationship management。

Right，In other words， you're going to have quality problems and you can solve them。

 but don't stop practicing Yeah， or you can lose your girl。

 You can lose your girl if a girl says to herself。If I dumped my boyfriend。

He wouldn't get another girl。Then why is she with you？If she feels that。

 if she emotionally feels that if I dump you。If I dump you。You're going to be lonely。

 then why am I with you？So you need to demonstrate to your girl。

Every few weeks or a few months that you continue to have options。 And despite those options。

 you continue to choose her。It's a jealousy plotline。 I'm not saying do it often， but once is good。

 once is good to remind her， you know， when you first start a relationship。

 once to demonstrate that you have options。Well keep it chilly in your food now。

 And then it spices things。 It spices things in。 home and rip each other's off。 Yeah， the sex。

 your sex life is even better for it。Because you've basically taken your girlfriend out to a party and you've been hit on。

And she takes you home and wins you again。So she knows that you have。Something for women。

You've got something to sexual。Okay， so that's our thoughts on delivery for now。First is structure。

 Second is material。 Third is delivery。 deliveryli， you get good in field。

The fourth one is volume and velocity。The volume and velocity of sets。

How many sets you do in a night and how quick you get from one set to the next。

 because it will change your game if you the difference between six sets and 12 sets is double the experience。

Some guys will do three sets in a night and they only have a quarter of the experience of a guy who did the same night and did a dozen sets。

So do a dozen sets when you're in training， if you're training for a supermodel。

 you ever pick up a supermod， put your hand up。Fair。Which one I'm in front of my girlfriend。

 the hot one。I'll just say that for now。Go to Helsinki if you want to up your game and have a prize to win。

In other words， a particularly beautiful girl you want to draw into your life。

Then it's worth six weeks of grinding。 Let's talk about grinding right This is in a way。

 this is one of the keys one of the keys to volume and velocity。 It's volume and velocity。

 It's getting out to the venues。That are target rich。

 Sometimes it's raining out and people will decide， oh， it's raining。

 It's most likely going to be dead。 I'm not going out。We go out anyway。 We got boot camp to do。

 We take the boys out in field。 And guess what when we get through the rain and we get through the tired walk。

To find the next bubble of love。We're in it， we're there， we've made it， and now we can open sets。

Some people think that opening sets is scary and dark and。Filled with fear and anxiety。

 While others think that it's the light at the end of the tunnel。We grind。

 grinding is where you're getting from one location to the next。Where it's cold and dark。

 And then you finally get to that next bubble of love where you can open up sets。

That's where you can improve your chances of getting girls if you get tougher with yourself and endure the grind。

Endure the grind。 gentlemen， there's a grind to this game。 You want to pick up girls。

 You're gonna have to go where the girls are。 The girls aren't around you。

 You're gonna to have to move your body。 There's going to be a lot of walking in this game。

 Some some days， what we do is we check out more than one venue per night。

 I bet you a lot of you guys get to the venue and you're there and you feel satisfied and happy that you got there finally。

 and you put your coat in the coche and you stay all night。 We do two sets。

 two venues per night minimum， If not three， even on a Monday， even on a Monday。 We do two sets。

2 two different venues， rather。😊，The first venue gets us warmed up。

Gets us some social proof that we can draw with us and bounce the girls to the second venue。

So we enter the second venue with people that we've met from the first venue。

 That's a good game plan。 That way， if the first club sucks， the second club may be better。Right。

You have a double the chance of finding love。This is what we're looking for。 Flies， by the way。

 are looking for love。 We are very much like T T flies。 We're looking for love。

 We're DNA machines looking for love。See it that way as opposed to trying to take。

What you're trying to do is provide value to people in the form of stimulating conversation。

Hopefully of value。Right， who thinks they've got the structure down。 Put your hand up。There。

It's pretty straightforward。Material， who's got some good material。 Who needs help with material。

 Let's try that。Who knows you need to fill that structure with material。What about your delivery。

Can you deliver well， Can you all run a good story and tell a yarn。If I haven't memorized it。

 I leave what we're doing right now， speaking in front of a group of people。

 hopefully in a natural manner， is exactly what we all have to get good at。

We all have to work groups。 doesn't have to be such a large group， but a four set， a five set。

 a six set。 Those are normal sets to open。 It's normal to open up a six set。It's not like， oh no。

 it's a group I can't do that， I haven't done a mix set before。Just open it， you can do a 15 set。

Just talk louder。That's it。That's part of delivery talk louder。That could be a game plan。

 What other thoughts do we have on the fourth key volume and velocity？Well I find when I started out。

 I my aim was to talk to everyone in the club。Everyone in the club。 when I did that。

 I'd go to next one。 Does't mean you have to stick in phrases。 But as you're talking。

 you can merge into the next one and the next one。 And before you know it。

 you're the life and the soul of the club。 Yeah of the party。 So you now， when you open a new set。

 And if they're weird and everyone else knows you， actually， they're the weird ones。😊。

So people just open after a while。 Oh， it's that guy。 And he knows everyone。

 So a course say open easier。 So when you want to bounce them。

 they're more likely to bounce with you to the next venue because they're like， well。

 he definitely knows where the party is。I act drunk。I don't drink in field really that much。

I act drunk。 I open with there's a yeager in my belly。 and there's no yger in my belly。

 but every now and then there may be by the end of the night because I've said this。

 But generally speaking， I go in sober。 I act Hugy with the guys。 You're huggy with the guys。

 Now I can get away with more with the girls。 I can hug the girls。

 get them physiologically accustomed to my touch。And not freak them out。Right。

 I have plausible deniability。 I've got a reason why I'm talking to her。 I'm drunk。

That's a reason enough。 It's plausible deniability。 It's context。

I'm not saying you all have to act drunk or be drunk， but it helps to act drunk。

When you're in a public gathering， it sets them at ease。

 it also conveys your current emotional state of non needing， non threatening and playful。

And you can sober up it。 And the truth is， you can sober up like that。 That's what's nice。

 So I just add it to my mannerisms where I'm acting a little toasty， toasty and happy。 good times。

 What's in your belly， What did you eat today？Exand。はい。I don't know how to say it's a Portuguese。

s cultural food belly I got I'm gonna call you eggs for the rest of the day。

 I got eggs in my bellyet。 That's good。 That startsia。 What do you got in your belly。😊。

I got lobster in my belly。 Yeah， I'm just going。 We have to eat these foods。 fair。

 But isn't this a better opener than so how are you doing trying to get them to talk。

 trying to get them to invest in you？ It's much better to say， what's in your bellyet。

 It conveys my current emotional state of non needy。😊。

Because we're talking about what's in ourbelllies。 It's very unique。

 it's a unique opener that I recommend you use。Because it's under the radar。

 they don't see you coming， they don't see it as a pickup。

They see it as you're drunk or you're happy in a good mood， and it conveys that on the open。

 we need to convey our current emotional state on the open。The question。

 who feels they don't keynote enough？Touch。The rules are touch often touch early。

If you do it after 10 minutes and it's all wooden， she's going to be like。

 what the hell is going on here？😡，So get used to touching， don't look where you touch。😡。

Because then that's weird touch。😊，So， so I always like to use the back of my fingers here。

 because if I'm touching。And I push away a bit。 She might be confused， Does he like me。

 Does he not like me because I'm touch him， but I'm moving away。

 but getting physiologically accustomed to your touch。 And they bend easy。

 So I don't want to put too much pressure on her。I don't like tapping and stuff like like this。

 You're not pulling her towards you。 You're actually pushing her a bit。

 But the first touch as a push it violent。 It's soft because I know once they bend。

 that's hard enough。And half a second and maintain eye contact。 So right。

SoAnd you get their attention from it， you could do a double tap， exactly。So kote a lot。

 It's important The knote escalation ladder is a bunch of compliance tests。

 If I put my hands out like this， does she spontaneously put her hands out as well。

 If I pull towards myself， does she go like this。Or does she step in with me？

I can see where I'm at based on her response。 So kno escalation is not just about making moves and being Mr。

 Manhands。 It's about getting her to chase you。 The power of kno is in the roll off。

 I'll say this three times because it's that important The power of kno escalation。

Is in the roll off the power of kno。Is in the roll off。You want her to chase you。

 the power of kno is in the roll off。Kno roll off。 get her chasing you。 Keno roll off。 It isn't。

 It's push pull， but it's not one step forward， one step back， one step forward。

 one step back going nowhere。Making a move， rolling off， making a move， rolling off。

 It's making a move， rolling off so much that it makes her need to reengage you in conversation。

 It needs it requires her to move back to where you are now standing because you've rolled off three feet。

It requires her to chase you。What happens is you make one move。

 she feels some discomfort from that move and maybe starts pulling away， you are aware of that。

 you pull away， you roll off。And in that void that's created in that void is a suction that sucks her towards you。

 she makes another she shows you an Ii indicator of interest。 When that happens。

 you can reward her by showing her an indicator of interest for the good behavior。

 and then take it away again。 and she will chase you that way。 It's one step forward， two steps back。

 one step forward， two steps back。 one step forward， three steps back， one step forward。

 five steps steps back。 So she starts to invest more and more and more into chasing you until she's treating you like you are Leonardo DiCaprio。

Even though you've never met the man， I think you'd be pleasantly surprised to hang out with him right if I were to call Leo in。

Ladies， yeah， he's not here。 I have met him though。 His first word to me was mystery。

I thought that was cool， yeah。Great man， by the way， great man and ladies love Leo。

So how do you get a girl to treat you like your Leo dicappririo， for example？

You have to systematically upload your DHVs into her head so that she can。

Give you IOs for having done so。So I'm going to go through before I talk about the last key。

 I'm going to go through the five DHVs， the five demonstrations of higher value。

 Let's zoom in now in a1， the first phase we're opening， and we use openers to do that。

 But let's zoom into the second phase where we're going to trigger attraction。Ready for this。

 We have to systematically trigger attraction so we can get indicators of interest from her。

 and then we can qualify her the third phase。 But let's zoom into the second phase。All right。

 there are stories that have to be told， storiesies that have to be told with bragging spikes built in。

And the idea is not to brag。But to brag。The art of bragging without bragging the art of bragging。

 the art of attraction is the art of bragging。Without bragging。

 if I were to say he used to date miss November。As an example， he used to date miss November。

 crazy girl， but absolutely dropped dead gorgeous when he's not around。

 if I work a two set and I say he used to date miss November。That'll hit。

They're going to treat him better when he comes it back into the set。

They're going to think that he's preselect by beautiful women who's miss Novembermber。Right。

 but doesn't she sound hot， calendar hot？It's a sound bite that works。 I'm not saying it's fair。

 I'm just saying that it works。 If a girl believes that that my friend has dated miss November。

 she's going to visibly show more attraction and start treating him like Leonardo DiCaprio。

 who is preselected。 And sometimes they would get interested straight away。 And I go， well。

 what happened。 And you say， well， Miss October got involved So。So the first of the five。DHVs。

 demonstrations of higher value， the first one and most important。

 80% of attraction is this is pre selection。If you can demonstrate to your target that you are pre selected by other women。

 it's like the boy band principle。 she can save the step of having to get to know you。

Because you have demonstrated by having girls around you that you already have value for women in general。

 so you may have value for this new girl。Isn't that a clever idea， that's why working two sets。

And and getting the target from the second set is better than just going straight into the target set and working that and hoping to snag her。

A lot of guys think you walk up to a girl by yourself。 No。

 a lot of guys think you walk up to a group by yourself。

 No what you do is you work two sets and get that second set to pull in to the first set with you to join you rather than you joining them。

Right it'll stick better。 you come preselected。 That's the number one DHV that you can demonstrate in field live by working sets in front of your targets。

 by having them see you engage in good conversation with others。

And if you can't do it by showing them you with girls。

 have a story about a time that you were with a girlfriend and you went to the Hollywood sign to touch it for good luck。

 trust me it works。To have a story that embeds the DHV into it。

 you can either demo it live or you can have a story that embeds it。

 So the first one is pre selectionction。 The next one， leader of men。

 a girl can tell that you are a part of a leadership circle of men， she。

 if she joins that circle and you become her boyfriend in the future。

 she gets the protection of everybody。All your friends will protect her in times of need。

So she gets not just a boyfriend， but a social circle from it。Isn't that clever？

We need to demonstrate that we have a social circle to the girl， to the target。 It's normal。

 in my opinion， to open a set and demonstrate that you have friends and then to meet her friends and even more so。

 have your friends and her friends meet each other。 If you get peer approval from her friends。

 you can take the girl home。She won't go home with her friends， she'll go home with you。

 but you have to get peer approval is if I take care of her from this point forward。

My promise to her and her mother is everyone gets home safe。 Do know why。Because I have a life。

 of course， everyone gets homesay。That normally hits better。What time is it25 to55 to months。

 So we got light10 minutes。 Well， that's， that's complete。 First is pre selectionction。

 leader of men is the second one， a willingness to emote to show a rich range of of emotion。

 not just the American smile， but tell a story and get into it。 You can grimce。 you can say。You know。

 for instance， when I had a girlfriend who was an exotic dancer， don't be a hater。啊。

She called me up at 2，15 in the morning saying， oh my God， baby， what do I do。

 Guys from the from the club are driving behind me and they're they're following me。 What do I do。

And I'm the one who has to solve the problem。 So I kept her online。 and I said to my boys。

 we got a role。And we hopped into the car and we met up with her， I'll stop there。

Do you hear the DHVs that are in that story？ Are you doing DHVs like this。

Are you hitting pre selectionction， leader of men， protector of loved ones， That's the third one。

 protector of loved ones。 if you can demonstrate that you're a protector of your loved ones。

Then she can feel protected by you。It's something hard to demonstrate live。 You can't say， you know。

 why don't you accos of that woman and I'll savor from you， right？

 But what you can do is have stories that talk about you being in an emergency situation and taking care of business。

RightThat's the third one。 The fourth one is showing a willingness to emote to show a rich range of emotion。

And the fifth one is successful risk taker。 The operative word is successful。 Those are the5 DH Vs。

 So you can create stories in your second phase in a2。 We call it the second attraction phase， A 2。😊。

That conveys these five key characteristics。 You will trigger attraction like Leonardo DiCaprio。

 Why is he attractive to women。 He's prese。He's a leader of men， he's a protector of his loved ones。

 best you can figure out， he's social， right， He has a rich range of emotion that he's demonstrated to you prior to your arrival。

In meeting him personally。 And he has a， he's a successful risk taker in everything he does。

 All five of them， he's triggered in you prior to your arrival。

 I think if any of you have seen my television show， have you seen the pickup artist， Good show。

 You enjoyed it。 Good， good stuff。😊，Am I preselected， Am I leader of men？

Willingness to em to show a rich range of emotion。 I almost tear up in one of my episodes， right。呃。

A rich range of emotion we talked about， successful risk taking。All five DHVs is what I'm saying。

 is demonstrated。So that when someone meets me， they're going to treat me with that level of respect and dignity。

 We all want to be treated that way。 But guess what， Not everyone has seen my show。

 Not everyone cares about pickup。 Not everyone watches reality television。

Then it's called approach pickup。That's where it's at。 That's where this game is played。

 So I have to start from scratch and make them treat me like I'm famous by the end of it。

Right from the get go with my material， and that's what DHV material is all about A2。Makes sense。

So we all have to get good at running two or three stories that brag the DHV points into our conversation。

 You get 15 points，15 times。 you've triggered these various。DHVs。

 and they will treat you like you were a rock star。

You only need three to move forward to A3 and start qualifying them。

 three indicators of interest from a girl， two or three， even。

 And then you can start qualifying the girl is theor of the Mesi。Getting her to invest in you。 Then。

 That's the third phase。 We'll talk about that another time。 people try and fit in too much。

 wear the same clothes， do the same things。 You want to stand out， or they're never gonna no issue。

 Yeah， I'm the only one wearing this God awful hat。And the only one I'm not who's， I mean。

 we noticed your bracelets。Yeah， that's graceac peacocking you stand out， who else would stand out？

Morning， guys。Exactly， so you now need to go to Zara or somewhere and get stuff that stands out。

 I've got a good routine for that， by the way， So I had loads。

 but I give them away to girls when Im not all not to point it out。

 but you are coming out to a group of you knew that it was just a group of guys。

 So you're not dressing up for the part。 But would you mind standing kindly for me。

So far what I see is a regular watch， a regular shirt， regular pants， regular socks。

 regular regular shoes。And glasses， there's no sexual conveyance。

 There's no conveyance that you are on the market。You don't look Okay， fair。 fair。

 And you're out in the day。 But just as an example is it would be hard to go into say。

 a convenience store and say， hey， my friend was here5 minutes ago。 And they say。

 what did he look like， And I go， well， he was wearing jeans。And a black shirt and glasses。

 It's not enough。It's not enough， thanks， man。It's not enough， we need to stand out。

So if you think that you need to stand out， if you look at yourself and say。

 do I look sexually active？If the answer is no， then girls are going to feel that， too。

 They're going to look at you and say he's not prese。Right， for some reason， you look preselected。

 even though it's more plain， but if you wear accoutrements， nonsense， rings and things like that。

 I'm sure you' dress up more at nighttime， you'll come off more sexual。 You look sexual。

It comes off in the traps you're working out right。

 keeping fit and you should have stories not call not to call it out。

 but someone who doesn't look sexual。 let's see， I think you don't look all that sexual No one over behind you in the green Yeah。

 what's your name。Are you connect， Are you current。

You may want to come up with a pickup artist's nickname。My full name is Eric von Markovvik。

 And that's why they just call me mystery。 It's a lot easier and get away with more。Yeah。

 you don't look like you're on the market。You don't look like you are a sexual being currently。

And that has to change。 You have to look at the part。So I'm not saying it's a big point。

 but it is a point that needs to be made。 We all should look the part， look like you're sexually。

On the market， that you're a sexual being， it has to happen， go to Zara。

That's where I got this thing。It's pointless to have here I'll show you something cool。che the soap。

Starting from scratch。Looks good。 Watch this。1，2，3。Yeah。The power and the glory。Even some glory。

 good， no power， just glory， that works。A scarf in the hands of a pick up artist is a powerful tool。

 It is magic in my hands。😊，It's a lock and prop。 I get to lock a girl in with it。

 She has to hand it back to me before she leaves。 Most of the time， I。

 I have lost my Zara product before。 But for 10 bucks， you can't go wrong。I recommend。

 I'm noting that none of you except one person， one person has a scarf， right。

 You have a scarf and you've been using it in field。 Yeah， at least20 different functions。 exactly。

 Yes， that's true， too。 that's true， too。1，1。Nice one is the fact that it's actually very long and very wide。

 So I can hold it like this， and I can keep a girl warm。😊，We have a moment in a taxi。

It comes in handy。Get smooth with it。 we're getting to the concept of props using props in our performance。

 An example is， maybe you can help me with this。 I'm a lefty。 I'm left handed。

 Are you left or right handed。 You're right handed。 Oh， I'm better。What。I'm not that good。

 I'm trying to get this on my left wrist and I can't do it， would you mind kindly？

What I'm doing now is called an opener， look at how close I am and I can tell a story about the travel that took me to getting this item。

 thank you man。It's there thank you， sir， beautiful。But isn't that nice。

 a nice way of initiating a conversation？We've only got five minutes。 What are you trying to tell me。

 Just say it。 Oh yeah， we gotta do a quick demo。Oh， that's right。

Do you mind doing this here I'll step aside， let's move these chairs。还有就は。个这个。But。

Hi and this this is the portion we're doing a dance floor game for those who cannot dance Yes。

 basically I'm not a dancer， but what I've come up with is an eight set move。😊，That。

Makes the girl think that I'm John Travoler。😡，Or Patrick Swwaazzy。We need to move to science。

 I zoom out because we're going to be moving a lot， so she might be talking to her friends。

And I'll do a little bump， not too hard， and I'll go， oh。

 so play for the cheeky and I'll put my hand out and then I'll spinner。

It's been around like this this slide off。One more spin this and then deeperpper。

But it doesn't finish there then I escalate so much that I pick turn down， bow。😡，ケ。I name。

Who the hell are you And you're in And I've seen I've seen Rob do this on multiple occasions in different countries as we traveling it works It does。

 he looks like he can dance and then you get the I'll be like do you do salsa start trying to explain it We were in Floropous in Brazil。

 The girl didn't speak any English zero English。 but I did that And then she put in Google translate。

 Wow， you're the best dancer I've ever had。 That's in Brazil。

 how the hell did that happen but yeah it's actually Can you in one last Yeah so right Okay I'll just put my hand out I'll spin him。

😊，And then I might move them over here like this。Just swap it It is really easys easy I've got a video。

 you can watch it， I'll tell you what it isn it there and then dip。😊。

Like that and then pick them up because the keynote is complied。

And then I do a better so I move away so it's not on their high heels gently， not。あれ。

Then I don a wow， does currency。then kiss then hi the hell you but not who the hell you Who the hell you know did you appear from I know she's in there。

 she's in that nightclub and she wants that moment to happen right She wants to have fun or a unique experience where she can actually you know。

 step outside of her own comfort zone。 So I think what you said earlier about being okay to pat and break and just be the person that does something different。

 Yeah。Its compliance momentum is going up and up。Just take your phones out and just put on a notepad。

Vex the rampage， you can see it in action。Can you do that day game without music？ We。

 we sort of have done that。So。Heley and I did a dating video and on that we did a bit of dancing day game we did。

 and it was basically did the whole video on my YouTube actually which is about demonstrating how to run an amazing day by filming us on a day we known each other for quite a long time but we did it completely legit I didn't know when filming was starting So just started and going through the street we're in a really busy street in London and Rob was twiing me around and I just you know what like opening the tree in the dating industry doing this stuff for 10 years。

 I was like laughing and having fun and going along with it and I forgot the cameras with that。😊。

Have a good time。One of the best ways of closing。Of getting contact information。

 we no longer go for numbers。We don't go for numbers。

We go for Instagram closes so remember this line， are you Instagram friendly？

Look how easy that is to say。And usually they are， and you can exchange， in fact。

 would you mind pulling your phones out right now？And putting me onto your Instagram。

If you have Instagram， presuming you do， and if don't get it。

 if not download it because it's going to become a part of your life。

 you can DHV through pictures and videos and videos。And it adds to the game， ask mystery， one word。

 ask mystery。And follow。 And I may follow you back if you are interesting， too。

And I'll give you mine。Wait， wait，'s。Mine's crazy mofo no。这两件衣服。Yeah。B are move。It's Rob ROB。😡。

Next up， B， E， C， K， S T ER， but we'll put it up here。effects on。It's the same Instagram that you。

By yes， y，ep，We don't hide， you shouldn't， we're you're pre selected if you're a pickup eyes。😡。

The last key， again， the four keys we talked about so far were。Structure， material， delivery。

Volume and velocity of the sets that you do， the last one that we can help the most with the last one is instant feedback by a mentor。

If you focus on those five， you're going to become great。You're going to have structure down。

 you're going to know what to say when you're going to have material to keep them captivated。

 to keep them interested in what you have to say， you're going to have your delivery down by practicing the delivery。

 by have being watched by a mentor， you can get your delivery on point。

And then you work on your sets and the number of sets that you do in order to keep a learning curve accelerated。

You do those four things。 plus the instant feedback。Of a coach who knows what he's doing。

You will become great， you need to get good at 25 to 40 minutes of material that's pickup 30 minutes for pickup then mid game or comfort game is six hours on average。

 you know four to 10 hours is the average pickup and then。30 minutes for seduction。

You got to get good at all of it， but if you don't get good at pickup the first 30 to 40 minutes。

 you're not going to。Get mid game， you're not going to get good at mid game。

 Here's the good news if you can get really polished at 25 minutes of material。

Really polished if it takes you six weeks， six months。If you can become really polished。

 you're gonna be laid like a rock star。Something to keep in mind， something to consider。

The rewards are high。There。And I think we're well over time， so we'll end with that。Okay， wonderful。

 I hope you are using that cheat sheet。 It's really important because when you write stuff down。

 you remember it better， but the best way to practice is actually get out the house and go and practice。

 So now you've seen the first video， please go and use it。 And then once you've done that。

 you can continue to the next video tomorrow or when you get home。😊。
