# RSD德里克-游戏十诫：1 主课：游戏十诫1.1 勿要任何伪神凌驾于你_ev

Commandment1。Thou shalt accept no false gods before you。

What will happen if this commandment is disobeyed？Nowhere ever did the old adage。

Faaiing to plan means planning to fail， bear more weight。

If you're not actively creating the type of life you most desire。

For life when compared to your true human potential。Turn off suboptimal with best。

It may be disastrous。Politicians， marketers， as well as everyday opportunistic men and women will line up to take advantage of your uncertainty and indecisiveness。

If you're not actively pursuing your own dreams， you will end up in play in the pursuit of someone else's dream。

If you don't have the skills to do that well。You will be among the lowest ranks in society。

Either homeless or one of the many millions recipients of social welfare programs around the world。

Apparently， that's acceptable to many。But if it was acceptable to us。

 you wouldn't be listening to this right now。The commandment explained。

Putting no false gods before you。Means taking personal responsibility for your life。

It means being who you are， striving for what you want。

Never defer to the wishes of others unless it's clear to you。

 that would be the best path towards accomplishing your own long term goals。

You are the CEO of your life， whether you want to be or not。

You can accept this fact where you can choose to deny reality to your own peril as reality will persist after your self delusions fail to be sustainable。

No one cares about your outcomes in life， more than you do。Not Tyler， not your mommy， not Derek。

That's some fictitious spirit in the sky。You are the CEO of your life。

 take responsibility for your own outcomes。No one knows what would make you happy better than you two。

It's imperative you think deeply about the drivers that would bring you lasting happiness。

And start building your future to attain as much as possible。We're on this in commandment too。

Both random and intentionally imposed events。Will'll come up that will impact the ability of all of us to advance our goals and live a care free life。

That's the nature of the human condition。Everyone has utopic fantasies of building some little bubble。

Your own little special place where things function by your rules and everything goes your way。

Utopia is an idealistic concept。Not a reality for me， you or any human who has ever lived。

🎼It Scott said。The confusion of the real with the ideal never goes unpunished。

In this program we will focus on objective reality as best we empirically can。

While we all try to create our little utopic bubble， people will attempt to impose their will on us。

This happens in the form of parents， friends， strangers， neighbors， teachers。Marketers， governments。

 etctera。Natural disasterrous may impact your plans。

Disease and illness will certainly impact your plans。There will be deaths in your family。

Some of your friends may die。The weather， the economy， the list goes on。

Despite these impositions and negative externalities。

Constant variables you have the most control of in your life。Are your own thoughts and actions？

When you modify your thoughts， you' will modify your behavior as well。

When you engage in more productive behaviors， you will enhance the outcomes you eventually attain。

Will this make your life perfect？Absolutely not。I've not lived a perfect life。

 I don't know anyone who has。You sure is held't want advice from someone who's claimed to live a perfect place。

But no one has more control to make your life better than you do。

Your excuses won't help you accomplish your goals。Your excuses will drive productive people rapidly away from you。

Similar to a plague。Despite any externalities you may encounter。

 your success and legacy will primarily be determined by the culmination。

 of your thoughts and the actions。Seek the best available practical knowledge and your areas of interest。

The areas that would be most fulfilling to you if achieved。

Then act relentlessly on habituating those best practices。If you do， the result will come。

A weak man might think to himself。That sounds like it might have think for something。

 we even do work to get ahead of the others。No shit。

Anyone who thinks they can consistently behave in a below average manner。

Consistently attain above average outcomes。Is deeply delusional。

It's unfortunate they were birthed from their mother's ass。Doubly unfortunate。

 they bumped their head on the way out。Anyone who believes in magic kills。

Should be given a finite pill。So they stopped cluttering enough the hurts for the rest of us who wish to be productive。

Bill Gates， one of the richest men who ever lived。The world won't care about your self esteem。

The worldorld will expect you to do something before you feel good about yourself。

I want a person who consistently engages in below average behaviors。

Ca a probably average self esteem。The only way this is possible is through delusion。

It's unlikely that you are one of these people。What are you listening to？

When things come up in the world and they will， foreclose your path to your current dream。

 work around them if you can。If that fails， get a new dream。

Pagmaticmatic application of this commander。You must learn to say no to things that would poison your life and waste your time so you can say yes to the things that you want most。

If you don't failure， you're trying， you don't failure your life。🎼Ancient philosopher， Santaca wrote。

No person hands out their money to a passer by。But to how many do each of us hand out our life？

🎼We are tight fist with property and money。Yet think too little of wasting our time。

 The one thing about which we should all be the toughest of misers。Warren Buffett also gets this。

He says the difference between successful people and really successful people is that really successful people say noah to almost everything。

When you say no， you're protecting your time。You're protecting your energy to focus on the most important things。

The founder of IIkeEa famously said。You can do so much in 10 minutes time。

 10 minutes once gone are gone for good。Provide your life into 10 minute units and sacrifice as few of them as possible in meaningless activity。

You must stop procrastinating and start doing the things that you already know what add tremendous value to your life。

Make the following insane your mantra。I will do the thing that I know I'm supposed to do when I'm supposed to do it。

 whether I feel like it or not。What if my Navy seal buddies frequently says？

Discipline equals freedom。Have the discipline to earn your freedom。

My friend Brandon Carter is one of the fittest men on Perth。He says。

 you don't build yourself discipline in a time that is convenient for you。This is by definition。

 only possible when you are engaging in a behavior that you know is worthy of your effort。

 but also emotionally discpleassing at that moment in time。

He's told me that sometimes he doesn't feel like playing to the gym when he wakes up。

 but then he reminds himself。It's also not a pussy。And he goes and takes care of business。

Look for opportunities to take on additional responsibilities that will help you accomplish your current and future goals。

Build the habit of taking action towards your new goals now。

This will make you highly qualified to achieve success。When the right opportunity comes along。

Kry Ford said。You can't build a reputation on what you're going to do。

This obviously means your reputation is built on what you've already done and what you're doing now。

Most people are obsessed or just getting by or doing the least amount of work。

This is not how you get a head in life。This is a recipe for stagnation and decay。Charlie Munger。

 who is Warren Buffett's business partner， says。When you don't make time to think about important things deeply。

 you are giving your competitors who are thinking deeply great advantage over you。Look， man。

 this is all good news。You can stand out in a major way by simply looking for little ways every day to add to your skills。

 knowledge， and ability。Over time， those who have been slacking will never be able to close the gap you've created between your usefulness and theirs。

Bar is very low， you don't have to do anything superhu here。

Most people are so distracted with our television and social media， they're not even in the gay man。

 they're not even competing with you and I。I'm not a perfect human， and I have never met one。

I don't believe a perfect human has ever existed。Don't hold yourself to a standard of perfect。

Tony Robbins advises this。Perfection is the lowest standard， not the highest。

Because you've already given up before you started。No one can maintain that standard。

All you have to do is take a little responsibility upon yourself。Spread the gap a bit more every day。

Between what a normal human would do and what is your true human potential？

You'll be outperforming everyone around you very soon。And it's time to level up。

 get a new set of peers who can keep up with you p。

Statesman and royal advisor Nikkilo Macchiavelli said。All courses of action are risky。

So prudence was not in avoiding danger， that's impossible。

They're calculating risk and acting decisively。🎼Bitness takes of ambition， Atmo takess of spa。

Develop the strength to do both things。At the strength to suffer。

Let me tell you a story from my life。The childhood was really a bit of a mess。When I was very young。

 my father was very wealthy。We had multiple houses， vehicles， things are really small。

Then he had a catastrophic business failure。You see his business was this。He was a cocaine traffic。

And when I was seven， he went to prison。I went to prison until I was age 14。

All the financial assets we had and all the purpose that I think I'm with them。

Those are shipped away from us。See， I was the only child。

 and I was the only grandchild on both sides。So while that was there。

 he was very busy taking care of his business， trying to gather financial resources。

It was really too busy to spend much time on the event。When he was gone。

 then I was left all alone with my mother。She is not the most ambitious person。

 She has pretty deep victim identity。Anything bad that ever happened in her life。

That was surely somebody else's fault。Anything good to happen， well。

 she's happy to take responsibility for that。This is a sad time in my life。

I just wanted things to be back to normal。 I just wanted to have the type of childhood that I had before。

I got to remember I was only seven years old， so I didn't have a lot of control over my life。

But I didn't see my mother doing anything that was inspiring and a better outcome。

🎼My father wasn't able to do anything。 And here I sit at home with my depressed mother。😔。

We're collecting welfare， living a very below average life。

And it really sucked and about the best thing I could think to do about it is an naive child。

Was to go pray。So I sat in my bathroom， prayed with all the naiveity that only a child could have。

That God would just put things back to normal and I could have my family back。

I did that for a year or so， heavy night before you go to bed。

But got never saw fit to change my circumstance， maybe he was busy getting a blow job， I don't know。

 but he wasn't thinking of me。My next strategy。Was to pray with the same sincerity in Ievity。

But to look down when I did it and pray to seat。Well else Aton didn't do anything for me either。

It was about age 10 where I decided， well。God's not helping， Satan's not helping。

 Mom's not going to Jewish yet。They had couldn if he wanted to。

So I better start looking for things I can do myself。

It was this moment I started taking personal responsibility for my own life instead of just relying on others。

That was a life changing moment， that was the moment my life reallyly began。

I had plenty of further bumps and roadblocks， I got into fights。🎼Exanded from school。

I wentnt to jail briefly when I was 17， again when I was 18。Always for violent crimes。

Dropped out of school。Had many deaths in my peer group， coupled in my family。

There many financial set packs。I have plenty of negative role models， but very few good ones。

But I kept him moving forward and I found a good mentorurs。

I tried a lot of past where I found a few that worked out well for me。But after I gained momentum。

I got promotions and raises at my job。I got my high school degree and started college。

I started my first business。I got more promotions from raises。Quit that job。

And my first college degree with Kaius Connor。I built that business further， I found RST。

They had a lot of facts。I got my second degree also with T Spanishs。It had a lot more effects。

I became a board member at the first company I didn't own。Made more money， they had a lot of stuff。

I do the best business school in the world。Made a lot more money。I have a lot more stuff。

Why do you care？Well， you've certainly had your own little turmoils from life。

There's a good chance you've had a lot of advantages I did。

You already have better resources than I did。It's great。

🎼You're already better physician to outperform me on whatever metrics are most important to you。

Given you have the following。The same drive that I did and similar brain power。

If you came from a rough place yourself， that's fine too。

Realize this moment that it doesn't have to stay that way。

You can build a tremendously better life for yourself if you have the motivation to start taking action now。

No matter what your situation up to this point， you definitely have better mentors and role models available to you now than ON or I ever had while we were growing up。

Learn from our failure so you don't repeat。Stop worryienting about any perceived shortcomings。

 just get your ass to work。No。Being the CEO of your life doesn't mean you can't to have a job。

How if everyone wants to be an entrepreneur？Many who do want it frankly， aren't cut out for it。

If your current job was a goal of yours， congratulations。

Enjoy the intrinsic benefits of achieving that goal。

 many additional extrinsic benefits that come along with it。But now let's take it to the next level。

If you're happy with your current job and eager to advance in other areas of your life。

 that's great too man， let's do it。If you hate your current job。

 but it provides you financial resources to work in other areas of your life that are more important to you than an immediate career change。

Great。You're not alone， you just described the transactional relationship that most of humanity is engaged in every day。

Except the benefits the current job provides。Let's achieve those goals you have in mind。

And work further on your career goals later。Being the CEO of your life means always striving towards being your optimal self。

It means always looking for opportunities to be even better than you already are。

Taking responsibility for your outcomes doesn't mean beating yourself up for shortcoming。

meansans accepting who you are now and always striving to be an even better you。Stay focused on that。

 stay focused on the solution man。s a lot of things you could do starting right now to make the best possible future for you。

 your loved ones， and anyone you'll meet in the future that you'd like to bring into your life。

Taking personal responsibility for your outcomes will give you more opportunities and higher quality opportunities than nearly anyone has on Perth。

Create the habit of staying in this mindset of finding solutions。

Don't focus on limitations of a problem。 find a way to work around it。 Find a way to solve it。

Think it through。 Is it worth the effort。If it is， keep at it， if it's not。

 get on to solving another problem。Brian Tracy says your success in life will be directly proportional to the size of the outcomes you're able to overcome。

Think that's through for a minute if that sounds dauntty and it shouldn't。🎼As a statement。

 that means。The more you can overcome your current problems。

 the more qualified you are to have higher quality problems。As you overcome those problems。

 you grow more and more。You legitimately hscalate your status in the world。

 You'll have access to more resources， the best people， the best of everything。

We'll also have the highest self esteem available to any human on Earth。

We all have excuses that could get in our way。TheExcuss won't help you accomplish your goals。

So stop making excuses and start making progress。Why do women care？By definition。

 the average man is just doing average shit， trying to fit in。It's about a sex he to a human female。

 is a cow brazing and a herd。Gavage behavior isn't compelling to anyone。

It's just a coping strategy to not be judged too negatively in the short term。

What life passes you by。Until you're old enough to die， they have an average barrier。

The bar is very low for you and I to stand out in a positive way。

Those who are motivated to act on their passions。Stand out vividly in contrast all the normal humans we' just getting by。

Women know that men who stand out。You have to childate more social pressure than a normal man could handle。

As long as your strategy for standing out doesn't come off as though you're mentally ill。

isPerhaps the ultimate indicator of your certainty， resourcefulness and genetic fitment to reproduce。

This makes you extremely attractive to the type of woman who would love a man just like you。

More on this to come in future commandments。Women want to be with men that other men admire and other women desire。

Just one habit。Taking personal responsibility for your outcomes。

🎼And assuming the role as CEO of your life。If implemented over a period of time。

Puts you in the top 5% of most desirable men on earth。Probably the top 1%。He did nothing else。

This will help you stand out in an amazingly compelling way。Exercises to implement this commandment。
