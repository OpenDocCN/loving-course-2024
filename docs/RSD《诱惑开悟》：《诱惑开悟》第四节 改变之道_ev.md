# RSD《诱惑开悟》：《诱惑开悟》第四节 改变之道_ev

Can the art of love be learned？Can we learn to be the kind of man women responded to？

Can we learn ways of being that increase our aura， our charm， our confidence。

 our attractiveness quotient with women？Can you learn to live a life that is purposeful？

Can you learn to be compelling？Can you learn how to have a certain Geis devivve that makes you irresistible to women。

 a man to be admired and desired？Can we actually change？The answer to all these questions is yes。

I firmly believe that natural skills， seduction skills， can be learned by almost anyone。

I have seen quiet， even shy men become charismatic and effective， enlightened seducers。

 naturals and leaders of men。Here's a question for you。Have you ever been？A woman's fantasy。

What a thought， think about it， have you ever been a woman's fantasy？

How would it make you feel if you knew that somewhere a woman was fantasizing。

 dreamily dreaming about you right now？Women are fantasizing about someone， why not you？

Can one learn to become a natural？We talked about this。

 we have all seen what we generally call naturals。We have known guys that are good with women。

And as we have seen， they aren't born with it， every man that is naturally good to the women。

Is that way because he made a conscious effort to be that way， he studied it， he learned it。

That guy you all know who was a natural， became a naturalt because he took from his experiences what worked and discarded what didn't work。

He sought to improve。And he thought about his attitudes and methods in his mindset very directly and very diligently。

Was I always good of women did I always have？A great self confidence。Well。

 let me tell you a little bit about my background。I was beat up and picked on as a kid in school。

My clothes were hand me down to my brother and I was definitely not cool。

 I was not a cool kid in school。When they were picking kids for the team， for instance。

 I was always the last one picked， you know how it goes， Billy， Joy。Jason。Jimmy in the wheelchair， Z。

 I guess。It's kind of like that。In short。I had zero confidence growing up all through school， zero。

 I was a quiet， shy kid， a bookwor。So here I was this scared， extremely shy， awkward little kid。

 and I remember in the third grade falling in love with a girl in my class。

Her name was Judy and I was smitten and I remember， I couldn't take my eyes off her。

She was so perfect in my eyes， I was so quiet and shy， long golden hair。

 I can still remember sitting on the swing next to her and getting up my nerve to finally talk to a girl her。

When I finally did find my voice， I squeaked out something along the lines of， I like you。

And she gave me what I think must have been my very first， not my last。Let's just be friends speech。

I spent the rest of the year in school watching this girl quietly and thinking about her。

 and she spent the rest of the year being the pretty popular girl in class and virtually ignoring my very existence。

Every year of school after that， I repeated the pattern。

I would always fall for the popular pretty girl in my class。

 and she would always freeze me out of her life。Not that it took very much effort on her part。

 I was mostly too scared or shy to approach her anyway。On any level， I had no confidence。

And never once did I believe that I deserve a girl like her。

That she could ever want anything to do with someone like me。

So I consistently rejected myself on her behalf and saved her the trouble of even having to acknowledge me。

So I was not good at sports， I was kind of shy and awkward， what was I good at？I was good at chess。

 I was captain of the chess club， I was a computer nerd。I still am， still am a computer nerd。

So this went all the way like that to my senior year of high school， the last year of high school。

 I scraped up the nerve。To ask a girl to the senior problem。Now bear in mind。

 this is the first time I had approached the girl in any way since the girl on this swing years ago。

Well guess what happened， I spent weeks getting my nerve up and I finally said to her。

Will you go to the dance with me and she replied？Why Z， of course， I won't。That's right， she said。

 no。Oh， did she already have a date， didn't want to hurt that guy's feelings by going with me instead？

She had no plans yet， but simply did not want to go me with me。That affected me greatly。

And as I continued on in life after school。I carried with me the same limiting beliefs。

That I didn't deserve a girl like her。Until one day I decided to change。

I decided to become a student of women。 I had no experience with women whatsoever。

 and I decided to become。A student， a woman。I set out to change the way I related to women and the way they related to me。

 I became a student in the same way that I had learned the Queen's Gambit opener in chess。

I started to study and attempted to learn the ways of women。And I am still learning。

A unique mix of personality characteristics that we call charm is what attracts a woman。

This is what makes them listen to us in the first place。

This what makes him believe what we are saying。And want to get to know us。

Charm describes many character traits。Communication skills， a compelling purpose in life。

 an unfailing belief in oneself to name a few。We have all heard the phrase。Fake it until you make it。

what exactly does that mean？At first blush， it seems to mean that if you do not have the requisite attitude or skill set for something。

 do it anyway and fake that you have it。Eventually you will make it or eventually you will have it。

Does this work？🎼Yes， it does。But not for the reason you might at first think。

 it isn't because by faking that you will eventually become something different than you are。

And that you are moving toward the notion of making it。

 rather the very notion of you taking steps to do something out of character or out of your comfort zone is not faking it。

 it is actually the first step of making it by taking the first step of change。

 you have already become what you seek to be， there is no fake it until you make it。

There is only making it。For every step you take towards that betterment is making it。You know。

 we are like actors， at first， unsure of the lines than steadily more inhabiting our parts。

Part of ourselves showing through， partly someone else。More and more。

 we are able to immerse into this other persona until there is very little of us left。In fact。

 eventually。We convince ourselves that this is the new us。The oldest U was the real actor。

It's kind of like those magic eye posters， you ever see those posters。

 those ones that look at a bunch of random colors。Patterns。You know the ones， you look at it。

 it's just a bunch of random colors and patterns， but once you get how to look at it differently。

 how you kind of look through it。A little cross eyed even。Suddenly。

 you can see the image hidden inside the picture。It's in there floating away。

Understanding women is sort of like that， you don't get it at first， you can't see it。

 and I can't see it， I don't get it。But then， almost with that explanation。

You just do suddenly you do all of a sudden you see it， you understand。

 and you can never look at it the same way again。Someone said to me recently that surely there must be a distinction between those who have learned to be charismatic and charming and those who were just born with it。

That one is real and other will always be fake。A close approximation。But fake。

Well let's look at it this way， let's say you worked at 711。

I come in to buy some candy and I hand you a dollar bill。So far。

 a pretty normal everyday transaction， right， but let's say the dollar bill I handed to you。

Was one that I drew with crayons on an akin。You， as a 711 clerk。

 would most likely be astute enough to inform me to get out of the store that you don't take fake dollar bills。

So I go away。And they come back a month later with a dollar bill that I photocopied on a color photocopier。

You look at it very carefully and hold it up to light。It appears genuine， but still you aren't sure。

 so you put it in the little ultraviolet light checker thingy and it glows， it glows wrong。

You are now sure that this dollar bill is counterfeit。

 and once again you kick me out of the store threatening to call the police。Undeterred。

 I go back to my basement lab， but this time I managed to create a perfect replica of a dollar bill。

Not one that just looks and feels exactly like a dollar bill。

 but one that is molecule for molecule identical。To a real dollar bill。

 the paper is exactly the same as the paper is a real dollar bill。

The ink is exactly like the ink of a real dollar bill， all of the little security strips。

 the color shifting ink， the hologram elements， exactly the same。This time。

 it passes all of the tests。That you， the 711 clerk throw at it。

You know I have tried to pass off 40 bills before， so you are especially diligent。

But after careful scrutiny。You are satisfied that this is indeed a real dollar bill。

So you give me my change and I walk out with my candy。So now here is the question。

 was this a real dollar bill or not？If it is exactly like a real dollar bill， but it's fake。

 but right down the molecular level， it is real， seems real。

 then what distinguishes it from a real dollar bill， surely it must be real。

What is the difference between my homemade bill and a real one？Well， when you think of it。

 since they are molecularly the same， they only difference。

Is the provenance where they came from the source？In other words， mine was made by me in my basement。

 the real one was made by the government。So the only difference between the two bills is their history。

 where they came from， functionally， they are the same。They both can be used interchangeably。

 they are both real。The lesson from this is that the source is the only real determinant of what is real and what is fake。

 so if a man has been a natural of women since his early teens，Who is to say he is more real or more？

Natural than a man who learned it。In his late 20s or 30s or 40s。What can we gather from this？One。

 there's no such thing as bacon until make it and two。Yes， all of this can be learned， I learned it。

Others have learned it。There is no one who was born in naturalville， they were all invented。

 they have all created themselves。The logical conclusion can only be this。

We can all learn to be the way we desire to be。🎼Includingium。

If we assume then that those first two principles are fundamentally true。

Then at what point can we say that someone is now good to the women？

We look at a man in a given point of time over there。He is no good women。

 he is by all accounts unskilled。But let's say he begins to approach women。He gets a phone number。

 he slowly gets better and better at what point would we say he is a natural。

 at what point would we watch him in action and say that he is truly a natural now he's good of the women。

Well， let's go back to another dollar bill example to see if we can get an answer。

Let's say you encounter a homeless man on the street， he has no food， no money， and no home。

His only possession is a tin can that he is placed in front of him on sidewalk。

He is what we would all callmonetarily Po。Sure he might be rich in his heart。

 be happy and serene in the sunlight and all that。But by the measurement of financial wealth。

There is no one that would say that he is rich， he has nothing but a tincan。

But let's say you up to him and you give him a dollar bill。Is he now rich？Well。

 one could argue that he is relatively rich compared to what he used to have， which is nothing。

 but in the context of the wealth of the city around him。No one would walk by and think， wow。

 that guy's rich。But what about if you gave him a second dollar bill？Now is too， is he now rich？

Well he's twice as wealthy as he was before， but again。

 no one would mistake him for a millionaire for a rich guy。Having only$2 to his name。

But let's continue。What if you gave him another dollar and then another dollar and then another dollar。

 what if you kept giving him dollar bills？At what point then would we say that that guy is rich？

Perhaps he might say that he is rich， and I agree when he has been given his million dollar。Correct。

But then what if you took a dollar away from him？And he is left with $999，999， is he still rich。

 what is the cutoff？The truth is there is no magic point， no distinction between rich and poor。

Whatever number you decide。Is the point that you would call himri。I will then ask。

 what will he be if you remove $1 from his tin can， will he still be rich？

That is the third important principle you are never truly accomplished， never， truly rich。

 you will never truly be satisfied with your skills with learning。

The principles of a natural enlightened seduction。Having remained the same forever。

 it has always worked。In all times and places， there have always been men who know how to be comfortable around women。

 it is like mathematics， society changes all around。

But the basic principles of men who have women in their life does not。

Like my10 traits I outlined earlier in this program。They never change。And they never will change。

I always wondered why the orchestra has never added a new type of instrument since forever。

Why in school did they hand out trumpets and tubs and not something different and new？

Since the invention of the saxophone in the 1800s， no new musical instrument has found their place in the modern orchestra。

The amplified pluck string and electronic keyboard instruments have introduced new sounds and greatly increased volume。

In certain forms of music。But the principles of generating musical notes is still the same as it ever was。

 we either pluck or bang on something that is stretched or we blow through a hole， that's it。

 two ways， and taken even further those two can be broken down。Into this。

 it all comes down to vibration。So the principles of seduction and success with women have never changed。

Just like music。Then why is it so hard to learn and assimilate？

Many men come to believe that their lives are only a compilation of psychological wounds that they feel they can do little to heal。

 they project their past experience of women onto every woman that comes into their lives。Now。

 although the state of mind is sad， self limiting and defeating。It can be very comfortable。

 it is easier， it gives them permission to lead a life of limited responsibility for themselves。

 it gives you an excuse。So as the years go by。And a man becomes accustomed to this kind of self protection is more and more difficult to change。

So when you find yourself saying or thinking， I think I could be great with women if only my circumstances were my looks or my wounded past。

Didn't prevent me from achieving it， then take steps to change that poisonous mindset。

If you don't have a girlfriend， but you want one。I'll tell you why you don't have one。

You don't have a girlfriend because you don't really want one。If you really wanted a girlfriend。

 if you really wanted success with women， you would have it。But understand where it comes from。

 it comes from in here。Now what compelled you to watch this program。

 what is it that you hope to gain？Most importantly， what do you really want from women？

Most men when asked， can answer that question。There are some men who think they know exactly what they want。

 but if they somehow manage to get it， they realize it isn't really what they wanted after all。

And compounding your answer is。What you desire from women changes as your experience with them grows。

It is a well known phenomenon that winning the lottery。

It generally does not make people fundamentally happier than they were before。

 just like getting that woman that you've always desired。For a short time yes。

 they seem to be on top of the world I won the lottery。But after time。

The people who were happy in life， who had a zest for living。Who are pleasant to be around。

Are still the same way after they win the lottery， the only difference is that they have a million dollars。

Conversely， if you are a miserable pessimist who hates the world for letting you down。

 you're going to be a rich， miserable pessimist。So ask yourself。

What is it you want from these creatures we call women？How do you want to be perceived by them。

 it's essential to understand where you feel you are today。And where you wish to be tomorrow。

Now I automatically have a lot， massive respect。For everyone watching this program and here's why。

I approach life like I am on a type of journey， a quest。And you。Also are a seeker。

 or you would not be watching this。We are all on a journey。

There are a lot of guys who desire to learn more about themselves。

 who wish to be more dynamic in their interaction with women to maximize excellence in their lives。

And yet they are too proud， they are too proud to admit it。

Too proud to admit that they might be able to gain something。And so they go on through their lives。

In misery。But always remember this， you're a seeker。But the answer you seek。

Can never be found in a woman。Inevitably， as men get better with women。

 as they get more comfortable being in their presence。

 they start to realize that the things they thought they wanted。They don't really want。

They're women they idolized。Leave them empty。Think of many rock stars and movie stars who want it so。

 so bad to make it to get fame and fortune， why did they want it？To get women。

To get the validation of women mainly。And yet why do so many of them turn to drugs。

 alcohol release because they realize that the moment they can get any woman they desire。

 the moment they can buy anything they wish， it loses its appeal。

When you have enough money to buy five Ferraris， it loses its luster， and similarly。

 when you can walk into a room， a club or a party and because of your fame or your money。

 you can have sex with any woman there。You certainly don't really want to。And if you do。

 it's just release。You were just horny and she was nearby。And you knew she would not say no。

Because of who you are。Bruce Willis said this。Becoming famous was amazing and fun。For about a month。

You know， when I talk about visualizing the future you， it might sound like a lot of。

Sounds very nebulous， like kind of new age and nonsense， but it isn't。

 it is the fundamentals of all success。And you're thinking， okay， I just want to pick up girls。

 and I understand that。There is no quick fix。 There is no three magic words that are going to make that girl fall for you。

But you will be swapampped with offers for that。It isn't that， it's a mindset change。

 it is a way of looking at your future and your life and yourself in a different way so that it is very much what I'm talking about now the whole concept of visualization。

Let me explain what I mean by that。We can spend 30 minutes watching a sitcom。

And that 30 minutes goes by， and yet we can't spend 30 minutes sitting quietly by ourselves。

And when you think about it in this day and age， in our modern society。

 we fill our time in our lives with activity， we have to， we have frenetic lifestyles。

If we have free evenings during the week， while we sign up for classes， we sign up for something。

 we do something， we join volleyball， we do whatever we have to do so that we're not idle。

Because we think if we sit quietly by ourselves， we're not doing anything and that's wrong。You know。

 in North America。🎼We are。We live to work。When somebody asks you about you。

 who you'll tell me about you， the first thing we say is we describe what we do because that's our whole identity。

But in reality。In other places of the world。They work to live。They enjoy life。

 they have a glass of wine， sit on a balcony， that's what they want to do。

And we don't have that mindset so much here。And the problem is we can't。Be what we think is idle。

But the truth is 30 minutes， sitting by yourself， contemplating your place in the universe。

And contemplating what you want your future to be like instead of that 30 minutes with a sitcom。

 you could sacrifice that for this， sitting quietly is the highest form of activity you can do。

It is the key。To correcting all the imbalances in your life and going forward。

So remember that when you are trying to think about， how do I visualize， this is what I'm saying。

 find a quiet place。Sit quietly by yourself。Close your eyes。

And picture you the way you would see yourself， you have to see it with emotion， you have to feel it。

 you have to as your eyes are closed， you have to feel。That you are actually。There， that person。

How you would feel， how would it make you feel if you do that， if you do that once a day。

Sacrifice your sitcom。Iense things will happen in your life because you are focusing on that。

 what you focus on。Is where your life goes。I'm going to tell you now the single most effective way of changing your life and your success with women。

 your success in everything。This is the most important thing you can learn here today。Simply state。

Picture yourself 90 days from now。Picture the ideal you 90 days from now。

Where would you like to be and how would you like to be？Pictured very clearly。What would you wear？

How would you talk？How would you stand？How would you walk， how would you interact with women。

 where would you be？Pictured very clearly， vividly。

Imagine how it will make you feel 90 days from now。Hold it in your mind for a minute。

Now from this moment on。You era everything from your life that doesn't look like that。You know。

 we are told to write down one year goals， five year goals， et cetera， forget all that。

It's hard to maintain that kind of dedication and focus。

 that's why we fail so spectacularly at all our goals and New Year's resolutions。Instead。

 use 90 days。That's all you have to do 90 days， picture what you would like to have in your life in 90 days。

Then head toward it。No matter what。Does that TV show look like your future you， no， get rid of it？

Stop watching Depressing new shows。That add nothing to your life。In fact， stop watching TV。

There is no better way to make your life more interesting than to stop watching TV and to do something else。

What you think about and fill your mind with is what attracts to your life。Success with women。

As with anything is not an accident， it is a choice。

It is deciding exactly how you want the world around you to be and what it will look like 90 days from now。

So do these three simple things， here they are。Number one。

 write down in a list everything you desire， no matter what it is。Number two。

 read that list three times a day without fail。And think about it constantly。

 no matter what you're doing， think about the things on your list。

 that's what you really desire all day long。And3。Don't tell anyone else what you're doing。

 don't tell anybody about your list。That's it。You have no idea how these things are going to happen in your life。

Just trust that they will somehow。Now we wish for things to materialize in our life。

 but we don't really believe we deserve them， we doubt that we deserve them。

The problem is that we wish for things。But we don't want them bad enough。The truth is。

 we would rather watch TV or player our video games than have a girlfriend and we don't want it bad enough。

 or you'd have it。The key is the clarity of your vision。

 you have to think of how you want to be and think of nothing else。

Concentrate on the things you want。And cast of the things you don't want。

Whatever reality you create inside you will create the reality outside of you。

NowYou might have no clue how the universe will align with your internal vision， but it will。

If you continually visualize what you want to happen in your life vividly， it will happen。

If you continue to think about your problems， your bills， your debt， your lack of success with women。

 your circumstances， well that will happen too。Whatever you dwell upon is what will happen in your life。

You see the average person makes goals， writes them down， makes resolutions。

 then they start to think about what about this， and what about that。It's our habit。

 we have been doing it for years and so you give your mind conflicting mental images back and forth。

 that is why you can read a motivational book and get all excited several days later。

Your old habits come creeping back in， and you find yourself lying around watching TV。Again。

It has been well said that the size of your problems is the size of your life。

That means if your biggest problem is how to get a date or how to pay your cable bill。

Then that is as large as your life will get， that's the size of your problems however。

 if your biggest problem is whether to marry a lingerie model or a bikini model。

Then that is how big your life will get That's your biggest problem。

 that's how the size of your life。So no matter what is going on around you， think about your goals。

Erase everything that does not look like your vision of the future。You have to see it clearly。

 you have to feel the emotion associated with it。And for as long as you can。You know。

 in your attempt to change to motivate yourself， what we always try to do is motivate our mind。

But you have to motivate your emotions。🎼A good way of doing this is doing daily affirmations。

 you know， it sounds cliche， but believe me it works， two that I've used for。Many years。

Are these number one。Everything and everyone。Prosperpers me now。I say that a lot。

 everything and everyone prospers me now， that means no matter who I meet or what situation happens to me in some way。

It is creating value for my future。That person or the event。

Is valuable to me everything and everyone prospers me now， say that yourself。

 it's a daily affirmation and the other thing I say all the time in the morning。Morning is a promise。

Morning is this。I wake up in the morning and I say to myself。Everything I desire。My entire future。

 everything I desire for my future。🎼Is contained。In this day， this morning， this day。

 that's the other affirmation I say， your entire future is contained。In this day。

So that's a very powerful tool， as I said it sounds clihched。

 but there's a reason you hear about it all the time， affirmations， they absolutely work。

So stop watching and sipid TV shows and talk shows， stop hanging around people who bring you down。

Stop reading magazines and books that have nothing to do with the way you picture the future you。

Is this hard to do， yeah？That's why most men will never have the success they desire with women。

It's easier just to relax， it's easier to settle into our old ways。

 we find it more comfortable and familiar to sit around wishing for a woman than it is to take the steps to try and get close to one。

Successful men never think about failure when it creeps up on them， they shut it out。

Successful men with women never think about rejection from women。Did they get rejected， of course？

But they force any negativity out of their mind。Now this is， I'm not talking about positive thinking。

 sometimes it's hard to think positively， there are days when it will be very hard to replace your negative thoughts with positive ones。

This can be expected， but the answer。Is to just break out your little list。

 the one that you were to read three times a day， and read it again。And head towards the things。

That are on that list。You know， I used to say that you can control your circumstances。

 all you can control is your attitude toward your circumstances。In fact。

 I read that very saying on a motivational post at one time。I used to believe it。

I used to believe that your attitude is all you can control。I don't believe that anymore。

You can control your circumstances， the world will arrange itself to align with your vision of the way you want it to be。

 either positively or negatively。Where you look。That is where you will go。

There's a story of a young man who wanted wisdom， and he went to a master and he said， listen。

 I want to have。The wisdom of the ages， I want to have wisdom， the kind of wisdom you have。

 and the master said， " how badly do you want this。

 the young man said more than anything I can imagine。The old man said him， okay， come with me。

he takes him down to the river， and he tells a young man to look in the river。

And so the young man gets down on his knees and he looks and he sees his reflection and he's thinking。

 okay。You's teaching me something about wisdom here， I don't know what it is， but oh， I'll go along。

And the old man says，  what do you see？And the young man says，"I see my reflection。

As the moment he said that， the old man grabbed him by the back of the head。

And he pushes his head under the water。And the young man's under there holding his breath and you're thinking。

 okay， he's teaching you something about wisdom here， but I don't know what it is。

 but well I'll go along with it， so he holds his breath。But that continues。And all of a sudden。

 he notices that the old man is not lighting him up at all， and he's starting to run out of bra。

 so he starts to struggle a bit。But the old man does not relent。

 and so the young man really starts to struggle and really starts to thrash around。

 he's running out of breath， and he's getting scared， he's getting nervous。

The old man does not let him up at all。And then he gets really upset， he's really thring around。

 he's about to black out， he's losing all his breath， he's about to pass out。At that moment。

 the old man pulls him back out of the water。The young man sayssuttering away he says。

 what was that about， what does that have to do with wisdom， why did you do that？

The old man said to him。When you were under the water。What was the one thing you wanted？

More than anything else。The young man said。To breathe。And the old master said to him。

 That's how bad you have to want wisdom。So that's how bad you have to want success。

 you have to want that bad， it can't be a wish。You want the magic pickup line？

The three magic words that will get any woman to fall in love with you， no such thing。

It's all a simple choice。You can begin right now by deciding that you're going to think about nothing else but this future picture of you。

Do you know where all the greatest books that have ever been written are？

Where the greatest ideas are。All the greatest inventions are。I'll tell you where they are。

They are in a graveyard。You know， speaking about the brevity of life。

I'm reminded of a quote from Beckett's play waiting for Godot， talking about women， he said this。

They give birth astride to grave。The light gleams but an instant。Then in darkness once more。

Another quote that I like as well is George Bernard Shaw， he said this。

 this is the true joy of life that being used up for a purpose。

Recognized by yourself as a mighty one。Being a force of nature。Instead of a feverish。

 selfish little clot of ailments and grievances， complaining that the world would not devote itself to making you happy。

My conclusion can only be this。We all want to know。

That when we are old and about to return to the oblivion that birth us。

 we might have at least once in our lives， experienced a small measure of beauty that we can hold onto in our memory as we drift away。

A memory to savor in the void。A singular instance of definitiveness。In a universe of uncertainty。

And then， perhaps。Our lives would not have been all in vain。Okay， so if eye contact is so important。

 what are some of the practical things that you can do to enhance it and ensure you're doing it correctly？

First， understand that a woman assesses you immediately。You know the old saying。

 you never get a second chance to make a first impression， well it's true。

 so it is very important to care yourself and present yourself optimally。All the time。

And your eye contact or lack thereof。We'll tell her volumes about you。Like it or not。

 she is going to judge you on the way you walk and approach her on the way you stand when you arrive and the way you talk to her。

And even more importantly， the way you look at her， that's very important。

She will immediately attempt to ascertain every facet of your personality from your appearance。

 your posture and the way you move。In fact。Within 30 seconds a woman will pretty much feel she has a handle on your entire past。

 present and future， all from her first impression， that's how important it is。

And a huge part of this first impression is the ease in which you， the enlightened seduccer。

 will look into her eyes。For a great example of eye contact。

Watch Mickey Rock in the movie nine and a half weeks。When he first encounters Kim Basingger。

 she is shopping for scarves， looking down at a table。

He approaches from the side and he says something to her and when she looks up at him。

He looks directly into her eyes， it's great eye contact that he gives her。But further。

 and this is what separates the great seduces from the average guy when she's looking at this guy who is this guy and she's attempting to look back down the table。

He follows her eyes， he stays locked on， he actually moves his head。To keep giving her eye contact。

It is very seductive and very subtle， he wasn't glaring at her， just nice， easy eye contact。

 it's a great example rent it and see what I mean it's very subtle。

So here's how to understand a little bit about eye contact and how to read hers。

When we first meet someone， another guy， for instance， we get introduced。

 we tend to shift her eyes around without really giving good eye contact at all。

 so in other words we know hi， how you doing and we'll look around the room and we'll glance back at him and we vaguely give eye contact。

That's general how you do an eye contact。Then in situations where we concentrate。

On maintaining eye contact， like like at a job interview for instance。

 where we're trying really hard to maintain eye contact。

 we kind of shift our gaze from eye to eye back and forth so we go to left to right， left to right。

 This is disinterested， polite eye contact， we're trying hard to maintain eye contact but we're not really connected with that person in any way。

So that's another way that we do eye contact。When we are having a heart to heart with a friend。

We tend to expand that range， that eye to eye range that I'm talking about。

🎼To include the nose and the mouth， kind kind of like a triangle。

 So we look at both eyes and we look at the nose and look at the mouth and。

And this is a friend of ours in acquaintance。Then when we encounter a girl we like。

 and we begin in flirt。We do something different， we tend to expand our gaze to include more of their face。

And even parts of their body， but we always return back to the eyes。And as we warm up to each other。

And if we feel there is somewhat of a connection， we start to feel a little bit of chemistry。

You will notice， and she will notice that we start to gaze more intentally into each other's eyes。

AndAnother thing we do is when we start to get attracted to somebody and we're having a good rapport is we tend to watch their lips a lot more when they're talking。

More than we would say， the lips of our boss。So we take in a bit more。

 but we always go back to the eyes and we watch them mouth。

So here's something you can do practically。If you notice she is watching you and watching your mouth as you speak。

At a date or something on that can be a very good sign she might be wondering what it would be like to kiss you。

And if a girl starts to do this to you， you will find yourself drawn to her。

 attracted to her in spite of yourself。Here's another sign。So watch for that。

 and here's another sign。Scientists tell us。That one of the universal signs of attraction。

Common to every culture on earth。Is the eyebrow flash。It's momentarily， we never notice it。

 but we unconsciously raise and lower our eyebrows when we encounter someone that we find attractive。

If they are similarly attracted， they do the same。We're not aware that we do that。

 but it is universal， it's a universal code of recognition of someone that's attractive to us。

So keep an eye out for this sun。In fact， it probably wouldn't hurt you try and enhance it。

By doing it consciously， hold your eyebrows up for just a second or so upon。First meeting her。

And I'll give you another example， another Mickey Rok movie。🎼Angel Hart。

 he does a perfect example of what I'm talking about right here。 he's a detective， and he's。

He's going to this hospital and he goes up to the reception counter and there's a nurse who's busy over there doing her filing whatever reception is。

And he walks up and he's going to ask her a question and he's leaning on the counter and he says。

 excusecuse me， she turns around and walks up to him and she's like，Can I help you like this。

 And as he's walking up he notices her and she's pretty。

And he kind of does a little bit of a double take， not really， but it's subtle， you have to watch it。

 but he kind of goes， ooh。🎼Almost like that， his eyebrows flash and he gives her one of these looks where he notices her。

 It's very subtle， and she immediately changes her whole demeanor from this person， Yeah。

 you and her gum， can I help you to doing this and like this and like women will do he just let her know that。

That he just noticed her just now， so that's another example， tick， check it out。

Another thing that is impossible to fake， another good sign that she likes you。

 and you can watch for this because you can't fake it， is her pupil size。🎼Invariably。

 the more she finds you attractive and the greater the degree of chemistry。

 the larger her pupils or yours will become， you can't fake it。

 So if you see her across the table in a restaurant on a date and her pupil size，😊，Is very large。

 you can be sure this is very interested in what you have to say and very attractive it to you。

Another thing is her blink rate。Her blink rate will tend to go up somewhat。

So you could artificially increase your blink rate to make her more likely to reciprocate to get that kind of attraction maybe starting to roll。

So the next time you're on a date。Caallibrate her level of attraction to you by where she's looking。

 she's looking at your mouth， for instance。How fast she is blinking。And the size of her pupils。Now。

 hopefully if you have given off the right eye contact signals。She will come across as lovestr。
