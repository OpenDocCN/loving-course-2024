Commandment 9Ôºå I shall help others accomplish their goals„ÄÇ

What will happen if this commandment is disobeyedÔºüYou will have about as much social influence„ÄÇ

Is a homeless person with a drug addiction„ÄÇNo one will care at all„ÄÇ

But helping you accomplish your goals„ÄÇThe commandment explained„ÄÇIf knows the old adage„ÄÇ

 it'll be like the five people you spend the most time with„ÄÇChimberone popularized this in the 70s„ÄÇ

This thought has been around one before him„ÄÇ1900 years agoÔºå TO G Kim Eteitis already knew this„ÄÇ

He said„ÄÇAbove allÔºå keep a close watch on this that you are never so tied to your former acquaintances and friends„ÄÇ

 so you were pulled down to their level„ÄÇIf you don'tÔºå you'll be ruined„ÄÇ

YouMus choose whether to be loved by these friends and remain the same person or to become a better person at the cost of these friends„ÄÇ

If you try to have it both waysÔºå you will neither make progress nor keep what you once had„ÄÇ

 You notice Epicteus doesn't say there„ÄÇYou might have a bad day„ÄÇThings might not go so well for you„ÄÇ

 buddy„ÄÇHe says if you're not careful to be pulled down to their level„ÄÇ

 you'll be ruined whilsts things like this let's see„ÄÇJeff Bezo is the CEO of Amazon„ÄÇ

Currently the richest man in the world„ÄÇIt says life too short to spend time with people who are not resourceful„ÄÇ

üéºÂóØ„Çì„ÄÇüéº‰πê„ÄÇYou must be actively building a tribe of people who are smartÔºå resourceful and ambitious„ÄÇ

 should also be actively distancing yourself from people who are distract you from those goals„ÄÇ

If you hold yourself to a high standard and socialize a lot„ÄÇ

 you be making plenty of friends with quality people„ÄÇ

Over time your life is so full of quality and positivity„ÄÇ

 you just have no time for anything that's not excellent„ÄÇTo be so full of great„ÄÇ

 there will simply be no more free time left over to spend with good„ÄÇ

Note on loyalty to your old friends„ÄÇOr your correct friends„ÄÇ

Invite them to come with you on your journey to a better life as they come with and keep up with you and your new friends„ÄÇ

 it's fantastic if they don'tÔºå you're already on your way to make better friends„ÄÇ

Give them several opportunities to step up and come with„ÄÇDont making an ego battle„ÄÇ

 be as nurturing as possible and gives sincere encouragementÔºå set your goal to create resentment„ÄÇ

Just to help your friend„ÄÇOver timeÔºå some will come and do awesome shit with you„ÄÇ

Others are just not on the same pathÔºå might do something cool by themselves„ÄÇ

 or they may choose to do not much„ÄÇThe ones that do find a productive path„ÄÇ

 maybe you'll get in touch with them again laterÔºå if youll get in touch with you„ÄÇ

 maybe you'll do some more awesome stuff together later in life„ÄÇ

 for the ones who simply don't have the ambition or fail at the goals they try at and never figure out a way to build productivity you'll see your conversations to generate into filtering out the best things in your life so we don't hurt these people's feelings„ÄÇ

And your conversations will all be about reminiscing over something you did back in the day or just hearing them complain about their lives„ÄÇ

 usually blaming others„ÄÇThose who don't heed my warning on this„ÄÇ

 wait around until your old loser starts getting openly resentful„ÄÇ

 tells you women are somehow using youÔºå they don't actually like you„ÄÇ

 tells you they literally don't leave the stories of some of the best stuff happening in your device„ÄÇ

 stuff that you've just come to take for grantedÔºå but to them it only happens in a movie„ÄÇ

At this point you either visit for an hour or once a year or so if that visit still brings you any value„ÄÇ

Or you just value your time appropriately and do something actually productive with your life„ÄÇ

You don't value your timeÔºå you don't value your life„ÄÇPragmatic application of this commandment„ÄÇ

Realize that girls like sexs as much as you do„ÄÇThey just have more social and evolutionary norms to follow than we do„ÄÇ

She gets excited to have sex with the right guyÔºå help the poor girl accomplish her goals„ÄÇ

Women want to be around socially resourceful people„ÄÇ

Her brain is evolutionarily designed to value abundant and deep social alliances with resourceful people„ÄÇ

It designedign this way because it meant a higher probability of a woman's ability„ÄÇ

To survive and to thrive„ÄÇIt meant the same for her offspring„ÄÇThis is still true today„ÄÇ

Mean she has access to much of the best happenings and resources the world has to offer„ÄÇ

Be conscious and tactful to build relationships with others who are both high value and socially savvy enough to reciprocate„ÄÇ

 the OG Pimp and Franklin once said„ÄÇIf you would persuade„ÄÇ

 you must appeal to someone's self interestÔºå not to reason„ÄÇNo„ÄÇ

It doesn't say people behave rationally and always give a fuck about the greater good„ÄÇ

He says if you are people to do something for youÔºå let them know why it's in their selfish best interest„ÄÇ

Make sure you're doing this„ÄÇDon't expect anyone to do a damn thing for you„ÄÇ

 unless you're thoughtful enough and resourceful enough help them accomplish their goals as well„ÄÇ

 behavior otherwise will not create a foundation for long term mutually beneficial relationships„ÄÇ

Don't make commitments with people or don't contribute to your life in tangible ways„ÄÇ

Make sure you understand your value proposition to others„ÄÇ

 this does not mean get involved in a series of transactional relationships„ÄÇ

When you're counting too closely the ratio of what you're doing for others versus what they're doing for you„ÄÇ

This isn't a friendship anymore„ÄÇThis can be a real turnoff to quality people„ÄÇ

Just be aware of what you can help them with and what long term value their friendship might he to you„ÄÇ

Go out of your way to help them„ÄÇSan through the crowd first„ÄÇRemember Seneca„ÄÇ

 we're not giving our money to the homelessÔºå we're not giving our money to random people on the street„ÄÇ

You don't give our time to those people„ÄÇButWhen you spin through people that have mutual values and mutual goals„ÄÇ

Invest best in those people„ÄÇInvest in them to the extentÔºå you get to know them more deeply„ÄÇ

 more broadlyÔºå you have a much clearer sense of who they areÔºå what they're about„ÄÇ

 what they're up to in their lives„ÄÇGo out of your way to do more for them than they're doing for you in the short term they'll be clear to you over a relatively short period of time if these are the type of people they' are going to reciprocate back if they're going to be looking for ways to add value to your lives as well„ÄÇ

Or if it's just some leech or narcissistic sponge that just takes whatever they can get„ÄÇ

It doesnn't look to contribute back if it's that type of person„ÄÇ

 say goodbye and keep it moving in my experience about one in three people that I've made these sorts of investments with„ÄÇ

See the value and or have the social intelligence„ÄÇTo look for ways to reciprocate„ÄÇ

 to make sure we have a foundation for an ongoing mutually beneficial relationship„ÄÇ

 productive people tend to make measurable action plans with each other„ÄÇ

Keep your communications alive with productive people by determining the following„ÄÇ

Before a parting companyÔºå you're getting off the phone with them„ÄÇ

Between now and your next communicationÔºå who is going to do what by what time and how will you follow up with each other„ÄÇ

 Never violate the promises you've made to people„ÄÇT0 truths cannot overcome one lie„ÄÇ

Ever make promises you can't keepÔºå failureure to execute is very much so looked down upon„ÄÇ

Cognitive consistency is extremely important to high quality people because it is also extremely rare to them„ÄÇ

I'm very reluctant to make plans with peopleÔºå but once I doÔºå I almost never change those plans„ÄÇ

BasicallyÔºå only a light delay or extreme sickness could cause this to happen„ÄÇ

Never fuck up your friend' relationships with other quality people when they did you a favor to get you an introduction when a friend leverages his social circle to do you a favor„ÄÇ

 he has loaned you his reputation„ÄÇIf you accept the invitation he has extended to you„ÄÇ

 you have an obligation to love and nurture the gift no matter what„ÄÇ

If I loan someone my reputation and they pissed on itÔºå they won't be friends anymore„ÄÇ

If I see a friend behave that way to another friend„ÄÇIt's going to be banished from my tribe„ÄÇ

I don't spend time with people like that„ÄÇA few tips on finding potential in others„ÄÇ

Look for people who are smartÔºå funÔºå oilÔºå not a pussy„ÄÇ

 look for people who share your values and goals„ÄÇBe sure they have a work ethic on par with your expectations„ÄÇ

Look for opportunities with people who have great synergies with you„ÄÇ

We ideally want to create relationships with othersÔºå we have a massive value to offer each other„ÄÇ

At little economic cost or frustration„ÄÇYou want to make sure this goes both ways„ÄÇ

When you find productiveive and resourceful people whom you can help them solve the important problems or goals in their lives„ÄÇ

 at very little cost to yourself„ÄÇAnd they could do the same for you„ÄÇ

 you guys are going to be dear friends„ÄÇDear friend„ÄÇ

Find these people where they are highly concentrated„ÄÇIt's sad enough to go out in the world„ÄÇ

 talk to strangers on a corner you have to go it as a high concentrationemp of the type of people that you want to meet For example„ÄÇ

 if you want to meet more future leadersÔºå dig yourself into a top tier business school„ÄÇ

If you want an abundance of pretty ri around youÔºå create access to events where those people are highly concentrated„ÄÇ

You be build some modeling infrastructureÔºå get access to the best clubs„ÄÇ

 access to the best sorority authorities„ÄÇCreate your own damn parties and make sure it's a great experience for the women to come„ÄÇ

 no thirsky creeps allow„ÄÇIf you create those type of social situations„ÄÇ

 make sure your other friends in the group understand your expectations of how they're supposed to behave„ÄÇ

When they're around these new people„ÄÇThis is basically what a wingman does and be a good wingman yourself„ÄÇ

Don't treat random people with the same respect you treat your best friend„ÄÇ

You just respect your real friends if you do this„ÄÇMake it clear to them they shouldn't trust true judgment„ÄÇ

Only a real loser goes out of his way to provide courtesies to random strangers„ÄÇ

 he wouldn't offer as his good friend„ÄÇThis doesn't mean to be actively a brace of the strangers„ÄÇ

But realize many strangersÔºå especially a man who don't owe you in the club„ÄÇ

You don't have your best interest in mind„ÄÇSome stranger talks to meÔºåI'll listen for a couple seconds„ÄÇ

 maybe a minute„ÄÇIf you just some do it wasting my timeÔºå I keep it moving real quick„ÄÇ

He doesn't have the sense to make his value proposition clearer to me„ÄÇ

I know I've got better things to focus on„ÄÇBecause if you don't value your time„ÄÇ

 you don't value your life„ÄÇKeep your intelligent and loyal friends with intelligence and loyalty„ÄÇ

Make sure you put them firstÔºå 100% of the time„ÄÇThey don't naturally treat you the same way„ÄÇ

 train them to do so„ÄÇIf they fail to do soÔºå go make new friends„ÄÇThe nightlife context„ÄÇ

Tell my clients on boot camp„ÄÇOnly get distracted at having conversations with you guys you're interested in getting butt fucked pie„ÄÇ

If you don't want thatÔºå just keep it moving and meet a pretty woman instead„ÄÇThe story„ÄÇ

Best relationship I ever had in my life with the woman I met at the Playboy mansion„ÄÇ

When she and I had metÔºå I had been there several times before„ÄÇ

And the standard there was for us to go homeÔºå but least be women a night„ÄÇYou bang a girl in the zoo„ÄÇ

 you bang a girl on the tennis courtÔºå maybe in the little private bedrooms near the game room„ÄÇ

You take a third one home with you at the end of the night„ÄÇMy friends and I did this so frequently„ÄÇ

 if one of us only had two women instead of three and get made fun up for a week or more„ÄÇ

This particular night„ÄÇI saw a beautiful woman in the corner of a cabana„ÄÇ

 and let me give you a little context„ÄÇIf you were lucky enough to be invited to these parties„ÄÇ

 which obviously most people weren't„ÄÇHe still had to pay a cover charge of between $1Ôºå000 to $5„ÄÇ

000 per nightÔºå depending on the event„ÄÇNow included in that cover charge was open par„ÄÇ

 you had free liquor all nightÔºå they had very high quality orurbsÔºå nice shrimpÔºå fileet andignan„ÄÇ

 amazing desserts„ÄÇGood quality foodÔºå all the liquor you could drink„ÄÇEverything's great„ÄÇ

For some peopleÔºå they buy these cabanas„ÄÇWhen you buy a cabana„ÄÇ

 all you're really buying is a little piece of real estate to sit in„ÄÇ

That excludes other people from sitting by you it's basically just a social status indicator the guys are paying 10„ÄÇ

000 to 25Ôºå000 a night for just because they can'tÔºå they still end up eating exactly the same food„ÄÇ

 they get exactly the same drinks as you would anywhere else just have a bottle of the same stuff sitting at your table„ÄÇ

So you don't have to bother to go to the bar and get it„ÄÇNow they have these cabsÔºå as you imagine„ÄÇ

 they have like velvet ropes roping them offÔºå keeping them isolated„ÄÇ

 so it increases the perceived exclusivity of their purchase„ÄÇ

I saw a beautiful woman in the corner of one of these cabanas„ÄÇ

 and she was there with two other women and six men„ÄÇNow I don't have the right wrist band„ÄÇ

To go into that area of the party„ÄÇBecause it's only for a couple dozen people that's spent this money to be there„ÄÇ

üéºWhen I walked right up to the rope„ÄÇ I look at the security man who is guarding the rope„ÄÇ

 I look at himm„ÄÇ I look down where the velvet rope is connected to the post„ÄÇ

I look at him and the ice again a bit annoyed„ÄÇAnd he saysÔºå ohÔºå I'm sorryÔºå sir„ÄÇ

 and he opens the rope right up and I walk past„ÄÇCongrarate to that girl„ÄÇI told her you're so pretty„ÄÇ

 I had to come meet you„ÄÇWe started to chat„ÄÇNow we weren't chatting for long„ÄÇ

 I got her on her feet and move her to the center of their space„ÄÇ

And pretty soon the guys that she's withÔºå are're yelling„ÄÇ

 they're barking little fells yelling in my faceÔºå spititz hitting in my cheek„ÄÇ

 spits hitting me in the eye„ÄÇI don't worry about it„ÄÇ

 but I know he's going to cost to security and it's going to happen to remove them there in literally less than one minute„ÄÇ

I mostly ignore the guy and I entice her I'm likeÔºå hey„ÄÇ

 you want to see here with the cool kids but you want to come on an adventure with me„ÄÇ

 have you ever seen the zooÔºüLike now I haven't come„ÄÇWe get on the other side of the velvet rope„ÄÇ

 this guys still bark and still talking shitÔºå but there's nothing he can do about it„ÄÇ

She and I go up on our adventureÔºå we had a wonderful time throughout the night it brought to my attention again and again„ÄÇ

 that this girl is from that city„ÄÇAnd she knows a lot of people there„ÄÇ

And she's getting invite after inviteÔºå all her ass parties in the hills after the mansion closes„ÄÇ

To come to Ferge's house in the limoÔºå come hereÔºå come thereÔºå all sorts of crazy shit„ÄÇ

I had to deal with one cock block after anotherÔºå women trying to pull her away„ÄÇ

 men trying to get her attention so they hang out with him all sorts of shit„ÄÇ

 but at the end of the day„ÄÇI paired up one of her friends with one of my friends„ÄÇ

And we end up spending the night togetherÔºå everything went beautifully sometime later in the aftermath of this„ÄÇ

 we started dating and spending a lot of time together„ÄÇWe' both invested a lot in each„ÄÇ

You're both very motivatedÔºå ever wasted time with anyone with different values or general goals than our own„ÄÇ

We actively created amazing adventures that bonded us together while learning more about the world and the process„ÄÇ

When you're accustomed to being around such a well-developed high quality woman„ÄÇ

 it's very difficult for anyone else to catch your attention and you're the kind of man we've outlined in this program and you screen your woman to make sure you have a elite lead compatibility with each other„ÄÇ

 it's extremely difficult for any other man to get her attention„ÄÇ

She just doesn't have the time to fuck around with inferior goods„ÄÇ
