# 瑞恩 谜男 顶级互动：迷男The Game把妹達人祖師爺   Mystery - Ryan   頂尖技術流vs頂尖自然流   情感行業訪談   瑞恩直播特殊版

hello你好，我是Ran，欢迎来到非常特殊的一期我的抖音直播啊和我的油管直播。那么今天呢我们邀请到了业内的非常大的一个大咖。那么在很多人眼里面啊。😊，是这个行业里面game这个行业界的祖师爷和鼻祖。

那么今天啊他真的来了。那么下面呢，我们来有请。Let me introduce。The man。The legend。Himself。Mystery。How are youello hello。

 hi Ryan， How are you doing Good and his wing man， ablaze。 we are live。 Yes， we are live。 Yes。

 we are live。 Now， before we start， I'm gonna give a quick introduction。 So mystery。😊。

I first initially got to know who you are。 I know we've never met prior。

 but I first got to know who you are back in 2009 and08。08 is actually when I read Neil's book。

 and I was in high school at the time。And I was 17 years old， Heartbroken kid。

 My friend at the time handed me the book， said this will save your life。 Stop crying。

So that's when I first got to know who you are in Neil's book。 And that was when my life changed。

 Okay， from the book。 And that's when I first got to know you。嗯。And now， 15 years later。

 16 years later， I'm sitting here in a live stream with you face to face。

Never would have thought this would happen。 Ho。 It's。 It's an honor for me。 It's an honor for me。

 I heard bit of things about you。 And then I heard a little bit about your background。

 How you got pick， yeah。And the Venian arts， not just pickup。

 pickup refers to what I believe to be just cold approach pickup， you know。

 meeting the woman all the way to getting her phone number， maybe even in a kissss。That is pickup。

 but there's still mid game， what do you do after you pick your up an end game。

 how do you escalate into mutual seduction。All of that together is what we call the Venusian arts that's the pathway of the Venusian artist。

And it goes beyond that， writing into the relationship to be honest， right away。Yes， sir。

That's what the vortex of love does for us takes us the next sequence to falling in love。

The vortecex of love by knowing my upcoming book， which I picked every corner of mystery's brain while writing's book。

 If you're a mystery fan， you will find out a lot of in inflections of the mystery throughout the。

Goool throughout the contest。So today， I want to open by asking you a。

I wouldn't say controversial question， but it's a a lot of doubt that a lot of my viewers。

 especially students and viewers in China， have wanted to know about you and your mystery method。

 So today， the very first question is。So in 2024， in today's era。

 a lot of people are doubting that your method， the mystery method。

 because you've been known for so long in the industry that。If your method。

 why and how it still works in today's day and age， So in today's dating。

 where let's say social media， dating apps， they're very， very popular right。

 and people still doing street approaches and people still go to nightclubs。

So a lot of people in China have a doubt about。How the method would it still work today。

 Because I read your book， mystery method。 That was the first book I've read about actual book about pickup。

So the game is not a how to book。 The games story the Neil's book was a story book。And your book。

 mystery methodod， yes， rather， yes， so I read that in 2009， and that was 15 years ago。Right。

15 years ago， so。We want to know why it still works today or if it's outdated。 So what。

 what are your thoughts on this。Well， my first thought is。

This weekend I was with my children but right before this weekend my wingman from London Vexter was in town。

 I'm in San Diego right now and we went downtown and I had a good time so yeah it still works it works better than ever for me because I've put the art into the pickup arts。

People are so concerned with the technicalities and the science of it as I am。However。

 they get stuck there， and it prevents them from having the courage to build a skill set。

And get out of the house and go gain， I'm an infielder。Before San Diego， I was in Scottsdale。

 Before Scottsdale and ran a boot camp there at an 11 manoo camp。Over four nights。

 bringing the men out in field。 It worked for them。は啊。Also， prior to that I was in Toronto。

 did a boot camp there。It worked there。So if people have doubts， let them。 Good answer。

 Have you always been in field all these years。Yeah， yeah， Ryan really go to Europe yeah。Ryan。

 really quick。 My fiance told me there's a little bit of an echo coming from me and mystery。

 She's watching in the other room。 So I don't know if in between speaking， we need to mute our mics。

 Maybe that'll help， Ouch。 sure。Is it better now， You can ask her if it's better know。Yeah。

H on once second him。Technical difficulties， but well worth the wait， gentlemen。

 we'll see a good showing of the discussion today。She'll keep an eye out and let us know。Yeah。

 sounds good。 We're going to be talking today about。Elegant art of the cold approach pick。

 what we call the Venusian arts。There's martial arts。 Everyone knows about the martial arts。

 but very few know that there is a counterpart to the martial arts。Known as the Venusian arts。

 It's the art of love。Yep， so I've I've seen Venusian arts a couple of years after saw the mystery method。

And that was kind of like， would you say that's an evolution of your own method。

 Is that an evolution of what you I don't。I mean， I've written a book called the Ministry Method How to get Beaut Women into bed。

 but my M3 model is not that I don't go by that anymore。

I go by the M3 model and I go by the Ven Arts， okay。So。

We just talked about you were saying how it it the mystery method still works， right。

 And you've been in field。 Yeah， again， I don't use that term。 Okay。

 how have you changed or did you made anything different from how you used to approach women。

 Let's say back in the day to to even now，'s the question， yeah。Things are well。

 things are the same in terms of opening sets and running groups。You know， that's the same。

 my material perhaps has changed， but really what has changed and evolved my is what I teach。

Back in the day， you know， people are reading a book from what is it 25 years ago， Yeah。

 long time and asking， is it still， you know， does science still rule， Yes， science。Science rules。

That said， what I've done is Ive progressed what I teach to what I believe to be the most important stuff。

Did it get。Positive results that night so what I used to teach was just structure and that is the science of it the science of courtship。

Right from meeting a woman to beginning a sexual relationship。

 that timeline is what we call courtship and we have silenced the shit out of it。Fair， fair。

 but I've moved on from that to teaching additional things such as material to fill in the structure。

Actual gambits that we run in the different phases within the courtship timeline。

That's the material that we use to convey our personality。Right， and to trigger motion right。

 beyond that， there's also the delivery of that material。So on a boot camp weekend。

 we we're constantly working on the delivery of our material in a structured manner。

 these are some of the keys to proficient pickup。And there are more。I teach， you know。

 a set of keys and a secret to the keys。 we get to defining what the keys are。

 I can get to defining what the secret to the keys are as well。 I I want to jump in。

 I want to jump in real quick， Ryan。 So there's still an echo coming according to my fiance。

 And I guess someone commented as well。 I muted my mic while mystery was speaking。

 So you might have to mute in between speaking as well， Ryan。

 let's try that and see if I know it's gonna to be a little less convenient。

 there's gonna be a little more pausing in between sharing。

 but maybe if you mute while mystery speaking or while I'm speaking。

 And we all just have to kind of toggle the mute button， maybe。The problem with that is。Okay。

 let's see。 Can you guys speak again。Check check 1，2。Okay I don't know if it's better now。

 I just change the settings because there's two tracks。 there's two sound tracks。

 So if I shut the zoom guest soundtrack off， they won't be able to hear you。

And the live stream itself has a soundtrack， and I can't turn that off'cause that's the main one。

 So if， when either of you talk， there's two soundtracks coming out， and I'm trying to。

Figure this out how it's gonna。Like I I can't。 I can't mute either one of them， so。

I wonder if you turn the volume down on one of them， you know， because it's coming through。

 And then the other one is picking up the sound from the other one。 So how got you。Yeah yeah， yeah。

 yeah。 I see what you mean O。Yeah， I can do that。While you're doing that。

 I just want to pop in really quick and speak of the relevance of the M3 model in 2024。

 We're not right， we're not writing phone numbers down on shreds of paper anymore。

 The game is going the same， right， It's still people meeting each other。

 So we have social media platforms。 We have computers。In our poems， but。Other than that。

 the clothes have changed a little bit。 The game is the same。 The principles are still very。Relevant。

I agree with you on this part。 So to get back on what we just talked about。

 my understanding is that over the years。Before， when you had the mystery method。

 the structure was down。 You were teaching a sign， very scientific， very structural。I guess method。

 And when you said that you're filling in the materials， my understanding is。

 are there new materials now， like more original new canned materials。

 Is that what we're talking about， It's always new material。 but you know。

 when you come to a live boot camp， you're going to get personal attention so you can take。

Your own stories and making material from them。 Everyone should like a comedian and have their own material。

 That's good right now， if you have to put on。诶。You know。

 if you have to simplify it at first and use other people's material， I give in my book， hey guys。

 it's a book， a collection of openers， I give over 160 openers。

Jesus Christ not 160 rather 6060 plus openers theres a little over 60 openers in there。

 you only need five。But I give them as an example of what has bonaf fide and worked in the past。

So you read that book and you get an assessment of 60 plus working openers that are tried and true that have led to success。

 not only with me， but with some of my PA friends around the world that I credit within the book that gives you an edge it gives you an idea of how to create your own after that。

RightAnd know every comedian needs their own jokes。

My my fiance is diligently monitoring the comments for us。

 And there are a bunch of comments coming in saying now that we they can't hear us and that the sound is torturous。

 Someone to actually use the word torturous。 Do we want to try to consolidate this to one platform。

It is on one platform。 I'm not okay。 Yeah because my my fiance sit。I just did， I put it back up。Okay。

 we're back yeah， we're by everyone paying attention to us right now， thank for your patience。

 we're having some technical difficulties。But it'll be worth it because it'll be a nugget or two that'll be worth integrating into your own game to improve your chances and success with women。

 I'm sure that we're going to find something within this conversation。Okay， let's。Are we gonna。

 are we continuing， yeah。So off of what we just talked about with the can material and how there's 60 different openers。

 a lot of new tried and true， I guess， can materials for people to use。

 And what I discovered also in the community， people who learn game， I guess。

 or trying to self improve in this kind of way， is that。And， and and this is what I've seen myself。

 Okay， in in， in， in real time is a lot of students or a lot of clients。

 when they start to use structure and ca material， they tend to become very mechanical and lose emotions。

Like， there's no emotion。 I guess they're using other people's can material because youre using your own material and putting the can。

 exactlyly that's better exactly can。 Exactly the idea behind it is quite a simple but really potent idea here。

 No your opener。Know what you're going to say before you say it so that when you say it。

 you don't accidentally go onto a topical thread that tanks the set from opening。

Or worse adding armss， os or pregnant pauses where you lose the suspect。

 you want to present your best self， so why not know your open？

Before you open in so that you can very， you know， in a calm， cool and collected manner。

 deliver your opener with great delivery and open the set with consistency， you know。

 so there are people out there that try someone else's material。And they're mechanical。It looks fake。

 they look scripted。There are pickup artists out there who just don't。

Put the art into the pickup arts。 They're just so concerned with opening that they don't smile on the open right。

 That increases your chances of upset set opening by a good 300%。 That's true。

 delivery is is is essential。 In fact， you know， I would say that structure is everything in pickup。

But material is everything in a hiccup。And yet delivery is everything in pickup any one of those keys is going to dramatically improve your chances if you focus on it。

 but imagine focusing on all the keys。That that's the idea here。Does the formula become greated？

I'm being informed now by my fiance that we're good。

 everyone is saying don't change anything perfect now in the we are good Okay， perfect。s fantastic。

 yeah。😊，Okay， good。 I totally agree with you on that point。

 and and what I see is'ca I've been in China for roughly， I think I've been back for five。

 six years now， and I've been coaching here locally and a lot of people。

 especially in the Chinese community。Their， their initial reaction or their response to learning game is they think that it's what you say。

 right， what you say and what you do that works。 So a lot of them are trying to avoid come up with their own。

 I guess， canned routine， come come up with their own stuff because they lack that originality or they or they lack that。

Creativity in their mind to come up with something to say。

 And my take on that is they don't have the emotions flowing while they're communicating with someone because at the end of the day。

 it's emotional connection。No doubt no， it's a isn't it that's how that been done。

 you don't kiss her at the at the first scene of the movie her。That's a good point。 Now。

 on that point， you mentioned， you mentioned kissing right in the beginning。

 So I don't know if you've noticed a trend in the community now。 So worldwide。

 there's a big trend online that people are trying so hard to race to the finish line。

Like trying to close the deal in， say， somebody come up with a YouTube video。

 say how to close a girl in 30 minutes。 And the next day。

 Im w to post something with close the girl in 15 minutes。 And then they'll be another the video。

 how to kiss a girl in 60 seconds。What are your thoughts on this。

 how this trend is going in the community。Well， they're all idealisms for the man， aren't they。

 They're all idealisms。 You know， sometimes you won't kiss the girl on night 1 when you meet her。

 Sometimes you won't even kiss her on day 2。 when you see her again。 Yes。

 Sometimes you won't kiss her until you're finally in her living room or your living room。

 and you start to then escalate。 Kean touch， right。It's up to her， not you。It's as simple as that。

 you got to leave it up her if she doesn't want to kiss you on night one。

 well then kiss her on night two， she doesn't want to， well then kiss her on night three。

Leave it to her decide her comfort levels as opposed to imposing your agenda upon her， you know。

 I can kiss her in 60 seconds I've had 60 second makeouts I've had that I mean i've experienced a wealth。

Of experience right， but that's not the norm or rather that doesn't make a good love story you know。

 yes certainly passionate relationships begin passionately at least that's my refrain right to kissing early。

But again， it's up to her comfort levels， so I'm going to be calibrated。

 I'm going to dynamically assess where I am in the pickup。And leave it up to her。

 and I'm going to change her mood， not her mind， I'm not going to rationalize why kissing me is a good thing。

I'm going to instead elevate her mood。Change her mood， not her mind， good。

So another thing I have by May， this one is a general bigger thought。Is。

Certainly you're leaving it up to her。Oh， you know what， a blaze， I've just had a brain bark。

 it was an important thought， and I've lost it， Godd when that happens。In the interim。

 I'll just say this， escalation is best thought of as an opening window。 We don't Yes， the window。

 And as soon as it cracks open， right， let's wait till that window opens all the way up。

 maybe even let it hover open for a minute。 make her wonder if we're going to close the window。

 And then we can seamlessly pass through the escalation window。I have the idea。

 it was just one of these overarching thoughts， be lovable。Beovable， you want the girl to love you。

 She'll give her body to you if she loves you。But play lovable game。Be a lovable person。

Be worthy of love。That's so good， because I think all the viewers who follow me and every Chinese person who are in China trying to learn game and trying to be good with women and finding success。

 finding love。I think that was one of the best advice and quotes that they need to hear is to be a lovable person that they can open their window to。

Rather than imposing like what you said， imposing your own intentions and will in the person。

 just by trying to achieve and satisfy your own narcissistic needs。

 So what we discovered is when they're trying to overly do something too quick， like， for example。

 when they see a video。Especially when they see an infield video。

Of let's say your 60 second makeout right or 30 minutes and you go home。

They get the wrong impression and imagination in their head。 that that's a daily thing。

 or that's a normal thing， but it's not。 We all know it's not。Yeah， interactions。

 especially when you go to a public gathering like a rooftop patio， rooftop patio bars。

 very attractive women by class。You can talk。Anywhere there's chatter， it's good， right， good。

 good place to gain。 If you can hear chatter in the background。 no matter what language people speak。

 if you can hear chatter in the background， you're in a good pick up location， right。

 So if you go to these rooftop patio bars and you do interactions you're not going to pull a girl out of the party 30 minutes in。

She's put her coat into the coat check。 yet She's in there for at least a couple hours。

 You're going to meet her friends。 Women in beauty are not alone。 They're in roots。

 So you're going to have to meet the groups of people。 You're going to be in there for a few hours。

 I would say it's usually at least 4 hours。 Expensive time is from 10 PM till 2 AM。

 You go to the party。And then I have， you know， some advice for those people who who don't go to the party。

No one misses you， but they're missing out If you don't get to the rooftop patios and you don't get to the party。

Now， is the rooftop patio one of your favorite settings to go in game。

 I wish I know that when I was younger， it is a great location for pickup up。 You know。

 certainly there's some music in the background。 There's a pool on the rooftop。

 There's some cocktails and there's some women in， You know。

 beautiful women in pretty dresses and men getting to deck themselves out a little bit more。

 You know， there's no context to dressing like this。 if。😊，You're on the street。You know。

 doing low quality pickup， you know， direct gaininging pickup。Women don't want to be direct gained。

They're done with it， they've been saturated。By all the failures of the direct gamers walking in。

 you know， interrupting a woman's pacing and she walks by herself down the street and more than that。

 fantasizing。That they're going to talk to a woman and convince her through words to come home with them within 30 minutes。

 You don't meet her friends。 She doesn't meet your friends。 That's already creepy。 right。

 Your're a can be seen。 Women can feel a man's agenda。They're better at pickup than most men。

They can see through our game。So imagine that when you're picking up a woman。

 you're not trying to pull one over her。You're trying to make her feel good with you。Yeah。

 what a difference being a go giver rather than a go giver。When you're a go getter。

 you're trying to get something from someone， they smell it and they fear it。They fear the loss。

Right yeah， so that you're a go giver and you're adding value to the party get to the party guys。

 it's worth of it。 right So how I feel from your take and your perspective is that you're quite against not very a big fan of the street approach。

I think。Going into the building and going up to the rooftop is going to give you a higher perceived value。

 And you're going to find where pretty girls are。Rather than standing outside of that building like a beggar opening with the most horrible opener。

 such as excuse me。Excuse me is a vrant opener。 It's a bums opener。

 I don't even turn it around if someone says excusecus me。Right？I'm sorry to bother you。

 they're already apologizing， I'm sorry。That's terrible。 being apologetic is terrible。 Yeah， yeah。

And and even just voicing that you are going to be a botherer。

 these are all errors right instead you can simply get their attention by saying hey guys。You know。

 gets your attention and then running。A point to why you have gotten their attention。

 which is what we call an opener。 Run an opener。 Just know your opener。

You'll feel way less threatened by the approach， you'll be less uncertain。

And if it had worked in the past， it'll work in the future。 Get good at five openers。

 And that'll take care of your opening phase。 You'll just get good at them。

 And you need more than one because you're going to be opening more than one group and a night。

 You know， on a boot camp， I recommend it， or if you're new to the game。

 I recommend going to a public gathering and opening 12 sets in a night。 in a four hour period。

 You're going to learn a lot。😊，The field teaches， you're going to learn what doesn't work。

 The 32nd pick up doesn't work。 getting a phone number in three minutes。

 It's worth the paper it's written on。 It's wood。 It's nothing metaphorically speaking。

They're not invested。So a typical pickup is going to be anywhere from 25 to 40 minutes。

 if not two hours， like it was for me on Thursday。When I went out with extraexter。

It was an extraordinary night for me because I had a two hour where set that was just excellent。

Was absolutely excellent。 You know， those nights that you have the time of your life。

 Maybe they buy you drinks like they did me。 And so you're a little loosened up。

 And you're with beautiful women， and they're laughing and smiling and enjoying your company。 And。

 and guess what， the girl。😊，She Instagram followss me， I didn't have to ask her。She closed me why。

 because I was interesting， I have a series of interesting gambits or game pieces that I filled the timeline with。

Rather than going in pure free style and in hoping that the topics that come up。

 even the ones like the weather。You know， a girl may bring up the weather and the guy will answer。

 talk about the weather because she brought it up， not realizing that you're talking about the bloody weather。

 this， you could be removing that from your game and replacing it with more potent material。

 material that makes people laugh， smile。😊，You know， I've also written a book called Book of Mes。

And then the， a nag is a way of disqualifying yourself from being considered a potential suiter。

And they're funny， that's the point of it， you know， a good pickup has a laugh track in it。

That's when you know you're doing well。 If the women are laughing and smiling and enjoying your company and in saying。

 hey， we're headed to the next venue， come with us。 and they invite you。

 That's what a good pick up looks like。 In fact， I'll go one step further and say。

 a lot of people don't know what good pick up even looks like。😊。

They don't know what a good pickup is so they don't know how to replicate it。

When they hear it's 25 to 40 minutes， they go， how do I fill the timeline Yeah， that's a big problem。

 Yeah， because most guys are are thinking it only takes three minutes like when we were teenagers。

Do you like me， I like you。Okay， I'm gonna cut， I'm gonna cut in here real quick。

 You spoke a lot there about how a pickup should be and what's not， what you think is not good。

 So here's an like a real problem。 Like， this is a real problem that most people are going to face。

 I don't know how it is in。 I know in US and Canada。

 We have a lot of patios and a lot of these parties and a lot of these clubs that they can go to and visit。

But the problem is， in China， a lot of our viewers， especially in Taiwan， Hong Kong。

 they're not gonna have a。Like， I agree with you because I've been to a patio many， many times。

And especially in Shanghai， there's a really nice patio on the B。Along the。

The right by the river in the tower， it's really nice and a lot of beautiful women there and very good experience every time I've gone。

 So it's a complete different。 Yeah， it's a complete different experience than the street approach。

 But the problem is a lot of guys are only available because it's so。

 it's so easy to just go outside and you're walking down the street。 And there's a girl coming off。

 Maybe she's shopping。 She's meeting her friends。😊，A lot of people are into day game。

 So if they don't have that setting available to them to the nightclub or the patio。What other。Ways。

 do you suggest， because they can't be going to a patio party every night。

 And they don't have that available to them。But they still want to game How about every。

 how about patio parties in the day。There's none There's actually none。 Oh And I can't go。

 Can I jump。 Yes， something to say suggest social circle， social circle。 Everybody says， oh。

 you know， cold approach Pick up doesn't work。 It's all about social circle game。 Indirect game。

 The M3 model type of game that we run。 is more closely related to social circle game than it is to direct cold approach。

 We are playing circle game。 when you go in direct， you can use this at a networking event。

 you can use it at at a friendss party， you can use it at a street festival where people are congregating。

 Thats true。😊，Yeah。Yeah， and the woman that I had met on Thursday， she was in an pre。

SheThere was a guy and a girl with her。So a lot of people will shy away from opening groups and will shoot themselves in the foot by saying。

 I like day game more。Why， because I don't have to meet groups， but the Hawk women are in groups。

 though the hot women have male friends， they're accustomed to men。You know。

 if you go to a venue and all the girls are on one side and all the boys are on the other side。

That's called the high school dance， you're at the wrong venue。

You're going to have to meet groups of people and there will be men in those groups。

 so you're going to have to open indirect that is initiate the conversation in an intriguing man to get them to invest or at least pay attention to the story。

As opposed to hitting on the girl on the open and having her have to choose you based on 10 seconds of first impression。

Give me three minutes of first impression on I can convey a little bit more personality in field。

Give me three minutes。 Now， it's it's it's baby steps。

 The first opener you use 10 seconds long will win you the next 30 seconds。

 which will win you the next minute， which will win you the next two minutes， and then you lock in。

 That is get into a sit down situation with the girl if possible or lean up against the bar or sit on a stool。

 have rejoin you and advise buys you another 10 minutes。

Of storytelling and conveying personality of building a relationship。That is classic。

 that is your classic method。Very classic。And for the guys that。

 for the guys that are insistent on doing day game。 fine， if you're going to do day game。

 do day game， But be artful about it， you know， no jogging down the street after women。 You know。

 do an indirect approach during the day， You know， strike up a casual conversation。

 De a little bit of your personality before you make her decide if she wants to see you again。

 The day game that I'm seeing these days is， hey， I had to come over here and talk to you。

 I think you're really pretty。 same direct day game opener。 we've been running since the mid 200s。

 Can we evolve just a little bit， you know。Tell her at least you like her energy or something besides her looks。

 you know， or better yet， don't comment on that and strike up a more casual conversation。

 Get 1520 minutes in before you suggest grabbing a smoothie， you know， this one and done。

 this fast day game。 this one note song， you know。😊，Be more artful with it。I like that。

My thought is this make blow people's minds。I do take aim。

I know you did game that's what I want you to share about your day game Don't let the sun dictate whether you can pick a girl up or not。

You know， day game versus night game。 Anyway， I'm the guy who can who who created the list of verses。

 You know， the different schools of thought， direct game versus indirect game。

 day game versus night game， single approach theory versus。

Group approach theory and then all the way down I'm the guy who took the time on a computer and wrote those distinctions and then the industry specialized into the niches of those different schools of thought I am all schools of thought。

A mystery。We do it all we really do。 There's this big misconception out there that mysters over here。

 just robotically running routines。 I have seen mystery， freestyle。Say things off the cuff。 You know。

 we can freestyle。 right， We can do natural game。 But when we go blank。

 when we run out of things to say， we have structure and material to fall back on。

 guys that only do natural game when your mind goes blank。😊，What do you grasp for。

 You don't have anything to back you up。 So the technical side of the game is very much worth getting into。

 getting deep into。You know what is really helpful for someone who is first learning pickup？

To have a list literally on your phone， a list of a core material。Now， what does this consist of？

Three openers。Three demonstrations of higher value stories。

3 qualifier questions to get her to invest and three comfort games to get her comfortable with you。

 once succeeded one on one with another。12 gambits， 12 game pieces。

Three for each of the first four phases from meeting her all the way to sitting down with her。

 building comfort with her。You just need three gambits。 Yes， you can use more。 Certainly。

 I have lots of gambits， thousands。But three openers will help you reduce the approaching anxiety dramatically。

 It'll give you the opportunity to open multiple sets without using the same tired opener。Right。

 then moving on to demonstrations of higher value to actually。Put your best foot forward。

 have a story to tell that puts you in a good light。Good storytelling。 I mean。

 that's the secret to to attracting women， isn't it。

 to be a good storyteller to have your delivery down， to be captivating。

 whether it's performing magic in my case or whether it's singing in her ear， you know。

 like Justin Bieber or。Telling a good story like the lunch at the W story by Love drop as an example。

 very famous Gambit is still around Love drop。 I chatted with him about who I'd say less than 10 days ago。

 So， yes， he's still alive and well， He's presently in Texas。

Love dropped my my wing man from back in the day， yes。I've seen。F。So let's move on。

 I like I get your take on the whole structure and how to game。

 and maybe that was your advice to people who even want to go and try out day game。

 have gambbits ready， right， here's here's a question that a lot of our clients and a lot of our students wanted to ask was when they get confused。

About game and life， because they're so overwhelmed with learning game。

 And they're trying to internalize all this stuff。 right， Like what you said。

 how you write about different parts of game， let's say， opening， right， you have your attraction。

 you have your comfort building。 there's different building blocks。

 So when they're trying to internalize this。They get confused about life because they're so into it。

 And that's all they ever think about。But at the same time， they're not getting results in field。

What do you suggest， Like， what are you suggesting for people who live in normal life。

 Let's say they have a normal job。 And then they're trying to also learn game at the same time。

Without your。Yeah without going without being overwhelmed， that's what I'm Yeah， I understand。

 Yeah I understand， Yeah， you're going to be imbald a little bit。You know。

You're going to have to if you don't have a girlfriend in your life。

You're going to have to do the work on。You need to develop this skill set。

 There are people who are trying to pick up girls without a skill set。

So I'd say take a step back from that agenda of getting a girlfriend， you know。

 the first girl you talked to is going to become your girlfriend， you know。

 the girl standing in front of the magazine rack。Right and somehow you're going to talk your pants off。

I want the girls in those magazines and those girls are not alone， they're in groups。

 so you have to sack up。And then。Develop a skill set first。

And then the skill set is running your gambits，3 openers，3 DHV stories，3 qualifying questions。

3 comfort games。 That's your core material at the very basic level。

And then become great at your 12 campus now go freestyle， go meet girls， friends， you know。

 make friends， meet groups of people， go out， talk to people。

 but you have something to rely on you can rely on your try and true in the can opener。

You can stack openers if the first opener doesn't hook。

 You can then start demonstrating higher value by telling stories。

Interesting stories that may have context within why area and talking to them。 right。

 A guy's only a second。 That's a called false time constraint。 We add those in， so that。

It seems like we're not going to be sticking around。But we add those in as a tool for notice。

And then you're off into qualifying andg。Actually asking our questions， showing interests。

 hopefully legitimate interests。To get her to invest in right。

 if you have three gambits for qualifying and then an example is here's my favorite one。

An example is。you had to sing on America's God talent in two weeks time。What would you say？

Or would you dance or would you do magic， you have to do something to impress Simon Ka。

That's my qualifier question， and it gets women investing in me talking。

Interesting asking the question。What's your superpower？I can levitate， what's your superpower？

Everyone has a superpower， invisibility， telekinesis， levitation， teleportation。

 which one would you want？Much more interesting than where you've thrown them。

Do have engineering here？I live right around the corner。Do you want to see my fish？

So would you say that I'll add for that too to the。

 to the guys that are real that are overwhelmed real quick， real quick。

 Would you say that's the difference between being technical and being natural。

Because a lot of people talk about being natural， a lot of people talk about being technical。

I'm super Yeah， so what， what， what I think you guys don't know is that a lot of people perceive mystery。

 perceive the method or the way that you pick up。 They see it as very methodical and mechanical。

 but they don't see the natural side of you。So the way that animals so they haven seen a natural setup doesn't look like it。

Think of that good pickup does not look like。00% is for don， yes。So。

My understanding is that your material。They were not prescripted。

 but you actually came up with them while you were in field， Not while you were at home。

Oh I came up with some of it from speaking with women because they're you know very generous with their conversations and some of it is great and so I would find myself talking about those topics。

I sometimes would have a bad night， and I would be driving home saying。

 I could have said something better to that girl， you know。

 and I come up with something better later。 write it down。

 put it on my cheat sheet until I have my cheat sheet memorized。You know。

 I am operating off of gambits。In field， but I don't have a cheat sheet。But they are in my head。

 they're all in the can and it doesn't matter which opener you use。

 just pick an opener you know well and run it。Same with same with the second phase when you're demonstrating higher value。

 does it matter which story about your life you're going to tell her？

Just tell her one of them and then tell her another one。 It doesn't matter which order。

 Every time you open up a group of people， It'll be different in that way。 It is， After all。

 a performance art。 A lot of guys don't know that。 That pick up is a performing art。

You're a performer。 You have to perform something。 You've got 25 minutes to wire。

And make her love you， not make her， that's not the right word。Allow her to love you。 Be lovable。

 But if you don't run material， you can't efficiently convey your personality。

You're just hoping grasping at straws then， you know， hoping that something will hook。

 that's that's the the problem with freestyling， you know， as a freestyle myself。

I find myself wanting to return to my core material。 The hotter she is。

 The more attractive a woman is， the less likely I'm going to freestop。Interesting。

That's an interesting take。Yeah， let jump let me ask this sorry。

 when you go back to your core material， like。How are you feeling about that， Like what what。

 what I'm saying isca when people are freestyling， they're， they're。

 they're going off of their emotions and how they feel。Yeah， and we might I feel Yeah， yeah。 so， so。

 so So what I'm saying is when you meet a hotter woman， in your opinion。

 you're trying to go back to your core canned materials to use。What's happening as right， right。

 I stick works right， right， So you fall back on the So you fall back on the what you think is like the good stuff。

I just stick to my and true。 Okay， gotcha， sorry， Blalaze， I cut you off there。

 What were you gonna say。No， no， it's all good。 You know， once again。

 going back to the martial arts analogy， you can learn a lot about jujitsu by just rolling around with somebody。

 right， But， you know， are you going to take that against Gordon Ryan， You know。

 the greatest grappler of all time。 You know， so the goal is not to become robotic with this。

 It's to become effective。 And like mysteries said， the best pick up doesn't look like pickup up。

 You know， so you take a naturally gifted street fighter against a well trained martial artists。😊。

The well trained， the the naturally gifted street fighters going down。 You know。

 you take a guy who has a natural game and he goes up against somebody who's world class trained and pick up。

He doesn't get the girl。 The， the training the Nuian artist is getting the girl。 That's a fact。1。

1 really quick ti that I want to throw in two to the guy who said he's overwhelmed with life and game。

 really quick， if I may。Maintain an action to study ratio that is leaning towards action。

 Opimise your training。 Fo on infield training。 If you know these concepts inside and out。

 you may need to detox a little bit。 you may owe a debt to the field。 So optimize your field time。

 optimizeim your training。 And then， like Myster said， You got to put in the work。

 There's no short cut。 You know， it's going to be a grind for a while。 There are highs。

 lows and plateaus in this game。I want to completely agree with you guys' right，'s right on。Okay。

 man， can we move on to some other questions about。You about your life。 Is that okay， Yeah。

 of course， because I know people are very interested because they haven't heard about you。

 most people in China and in the Asian community， especially the Chinese community。

 everybody knows you from the book and from V H1 from your old tapes and from your old videos。

They are curious。 and they don't know what's been going on in your life。 Let's say for the past。

 I would say，5 to maybe 8 years。 A lot of people actually don't even know that youre Yeah。

 so a lot of people don't even actually know if you're still active in field。

 Are you actively going out Pick up and how is that going and where you doing these things。

 I'd love to tell you。 So yeah， yeah。I have two children。My son is 10， his name is Vegas。

 and my daughter is 17 and her name's Dakota。Now。For that reason， I don't do infield footage。

 I don't have infield footage， I just don't believe in it， the nightclubs don't need a camera。

 you know， usually there's no cameras in a nightclub。Right so that， you know， men and women can meet。

Discreettely。Right， they don't have to do it in the face of others， you know， like on a street。

You can actually， you know， be classy about the the meat， it's what we call a meat cuteute。Right。

 when a man and a woman needed a movie， you know， they bump into each other。

That is known as the Mincu。So what we're attempting to do with indirect game is make it a destiny moment。

You know， make her feel like this was destiny。 I'm so glad that I came out。

 I wouldn't have met this man otherwise。😊，Right， and if you can win over her friends and disarm her friends。

Make them feel like you。And the women of interest are a good match， then you've got peer approval。

Right and a that's a good situation to be in。So what I suggest people do is practice and train for that。

And that's something that I've done。 I've gone into public gatherings and done that。

 and I've had some success in field， but I don't want cameras。Because I've got kids。

 I don't know my kids seeing dad picking up girls， making up with girls in nightcls。You know。

 when they're old enough。They'll get to enjoy that part of life themselves， you know。

 when they're in their late  twentiess。Are you gonna give your son dating advice or pickup advice if you ever Well。

 he was here this weekend。 And， you know， his favourite opener is who needs a That's such In' that a opener for a warm。

 welcoming opener。 Yeah， great opener。😊，My favorite opener， by the way。

 is nothing can wreck this day。My friends and I we conducted the caper， a project。

 and now that it's over， we're celebrating at the end of the oceans 11。 Nothing breakfast this day。

 I so very grateful。 That's my favorite open。😊，My son's openers are shorter。

 but they're just as powerful。And he's made friends， you know， he had a sleepover last night。

With friends staying over so being new to San Diego at age 10。

 I think he's already developing a really good social skill set People just forget that。You know。

 you're better than you think。That's something that I would have as advice to those listening is that you just have to believe in yourself enough。

And know a few good gambits to fill in that timeline so you can feel safe。

Trust someone one to be in the set on your side with you。 And that is you， You know。

 there's a three set over there。 I don't know who those people are。 Why do I even want to meet them。

 I don't know what to say to them。That's the worst situation to be in。

 If you knew what to say to them， you had a cool opener like nothing can wreck this day。

 You can in engage in the conversation without。Telegraphing interest。On the。

Something did your son come up with his own opener， who needs a hug。No， no。

 I gave it to him many many many ago。 and he loves it。 Okay， I also taught him the magic。

That's right， he's 10 now right and it magic is impressive。

 I have a video clip of him performing magic that I show to friends and they're impressed fighting him。

That's impressive，10 year old magicians， right。So it's not about girls for him he's not in that head space yet。

 he's going to be surprised when puberty hits。You know。His his goals will change as minded。

 that's another idea a lot of people choose goals when they were children， you know。

 like I wanted to get into computers， I wanted to become an engineer。

 but then puberty hits and engineers don't attract women generally。

Even though a lot of engineers become billionaires。Right， but then they have real problems later。

Yeah， that a problems inside。 there's an example of how the game has changed in 2024。

 It's cool to be an engineer and an entrepreneur now， you know， so yeah that's true too。

 Yeah do you guys do， do you guys do online game at all。😊，Are you on Tinder at all。

 are you on getting apps？I do。 I do。 I'm， I'm engaged now。 actually， that's how I at my fiance。

 But yes， I do online game。 Yeah， I like， I like the full spectrum of game， day game， night game。

 social circle， online。 but my roots are definitely in technical game， the M3 model。 I was， you know。

 that was my lineage， if you will。 So I'm， I'm loyal to the indirect。😊，Style， the solid game。

 the art of pick rather than the science of it。 the science and art fused together， will'll say。

 but yes， I've done some online game。 I've only dated one woman off of Tider。

 and it lasted two years。 So I knew how not to screw it up。 But a lot of guys get first dates。

 A lot of first dates。 That's abysmal failure。 If you can't see the girl a second time。

 You' lost her by meeting her。 She was interested in you by your profile。

 And then you went on a date。 And she never wants to see you again。

 You got to get some games on That's your problem。 you've been on more than three dates。

And you lost all three girls。You're working without a skill set。Yeah。

 can we just be clear real quick。 Mystery says he doesn't do online game。

 But the one time he set up a tender account。 The first date that he went on。

 the girl became a two and a half year girlfriend of his or year and a half or whatever。

 and she was beautiful。 She was very nice and met her in Toronto。 So mystery doesn't do online game。

 except the one time he knocked it out of the park。 He stepped up to the play once。 And， you know。

 one for one online。 don't do on game is because it seems to me to be quite saturated。 That's all。

 It's， it's saturated。呃。What is that industry saturated market， though。

 they very saturated statistics where the top， you know。

 the top 5% of guys have options with the 90% of women or whatever。

 So it's kind of feast or fanmin on。 You're either crushing it or you， you're starving。

 And then there's some in between。 But that curve gets steep。

So it sells hope and generally doesn't deliver you don't have a skill set。It doesn't deliver her。

 I'm curious， leads to my next question to you with your online experience。

 which leads to my question about texting。 So a lot of guys have problems texting。 I mean， they have。

 I， I， I think most people who get into the industry who has read your book or learn the methods and seen some stuff from almost anyone they could go out and maybe get a number。

 But in China， what we do is they get their wechat， which is our。Communication app or our social app。

 And once they get someone's contact information， a lot of people have problems texting。

 What are your thoughts on that， Like， are you， do you have the same structure as you do for infield for texting。

 Like you have the same can materials for texting， same thing or what's your take on。

There's two situations for texting， one is going online like on Instagram and trolling strangers and throwing texts at strangers in the hopes of convincing them to come over and have sex。

I don't recommend using Instagram a as anything than in what it is。

 a communication tool with your friends。So if you're trolling strangers， I don't recommend in that。

You know， it's very low probability， low value as well。And yes， have I tried it。 Of course。

 I tried it。 There beautiful faces， I don't know who they are。 they could be men， you know。

 friend of catfish， but there I am sending messages anyway。

 and being creative about it and doing all manner of experiments just it's generally considered quite low value to try to pick up a girl that you've never met on Instagram right。

 especially if she's gorgeous and she has 6 million followers come on， you're really reaching。

 you know， but differently is what if you meet a woman in real life and her group。😊，Okay。

 you won't meet a girl by itself。 Get rid of that fantasy， Gu。 Yeah。

 what do I say to that one girl to get her to like me， That doesn't help。

 What do I say to the group of people to get peer approvals so that I can work into a sit down situation with my woman of interest。

 That's a better thought to have。 That's what we've got to prepare you for。

 That's why you need a core material a core materialist。Fair fair was ablaze， if you don't mind。Well。

 the idea was building a solid connection， peer approval， then get in the number。

 So many guys wonder， what do I text the woman。 And it's not what you text her。

 It's the connection that you build before you start exchanging messages。 Now。

 you have her on Instagram。 She's a person you've met in real life。And she's on your Instagram。

 Now you use it as a communication tool and rather than texting like a teenager。

Just press the button， it's a video phone it's built into Instagram press the video button。

 she answers it for her friends。 she dolls up and puts her makeup on every day because she's getting phone calls from her friends。

She'll answer if she wants to。You know， if you're Leonard at theCaprio and you call a girl。

 she's going to answer she's going to quit her job to answer that that call so all you have to do then is when you're picking her up。

Convey that you have high value， just like Leonardo DiCario does。And she'll treat you like that。

 she'll treat you with respect and dignity。But you have to earn respect and dignity。

 And that's where the pickup comes into play。 You know， you work a set a group of people is a set。

For 25 to 40 minutes， get her contact information。And then either that night or the next day。

Start conversing with her。Actually， video call her， shoot the shit with her。

 you don't have to hide behind text。Textite， I believe。

 is mainly for logistics sure you could run a gamut if you want， run， you know。

 something that'll change for mood。But it's very difficult to be a great poet for a lot of guys。

 you know， writing poetry to a girl， whatever it is， it's poetry。

 hey loved Dr just said me something。So he's alive and well。He's out there。

 So you're not a fan of this back and forth texting to maintain sure。Okay。

I'm too busy for that that's that was， you know， that's from the 80s， isn't it。

 texting is from the 80s？Why hide behind it when you can just press on the same machine。

 videoidephone。 Everyone has video phones，2024。 We've had video phone for around 20 years now。

 maybe longer。Use it it。When you have abundance， too， you can do this stuff。 You know。

 most guys are sitting there thinking， what should I text her。

 What are the magic words that I should say to get her to meet up of me。

 We're building a solid connection before closing the number。 And then we're calling her。

 We're hitting a video button， right， We're sending her a voice text。

 We're sending her a song to listen to。 We're letting the song do three or four minutes of work for us。

 We're occupying a larger amount of space in her mind。 right。

 So what we're doing is separating ourselves from the typical du。 You know。

 I'm not in a rush to meet up with her。 I use it for logistics。 Certainly。

 but there's a bit of personality that can be conveyed through text。

 And when we don't rush to meet up with her once again， that's what most guys are doing， hey。

 when you free for coffee。 Can I take you out to dinner。 You know， The art， again， where's the art。

 We're all about the art。😊，Yeah。Good stuff。 Good stuff。 leads to my next part now。Back in the day。

 when I used to。Read about your mystery method and watch some of your videos。

 I remember you saying that。Generally， from meat to sex。

 you said it would be roughly around 2 to 4 hours of F time。 Now， is that it still go in your。

 in your， in your ideas。In the book， the mystery method how to get beautiful woman into Tibet I wrote about the seven hour rule generally a pickup is。

Again， it's up to her comfort level not yours， but generally it's going to be anywhere between four and 10 hours if it's less than four。

 which you can do with good logistics， you know， if you have an Airbnb in the entertainment district of a city。

And you meet meet people at the rooftop patio bar or on the street and you invite them back to your house and you have a little gathering at your place and you know you get to sit out on a balcony and and enjoy the fire pit together right you can do you know two or three hours and that may be you know fast for a lot of women generally。

 but passionate relationships begin passionately so you can reframe it for a little early seduction。

The logistics are handled。But generally it's going to be four to 10 hours， if you're over 10 hours。

 you're falling into the， let's just be friends zone。Right？And if you're。Under four hours。

 you're compromising for comfort levels。 You're hitting on her too soon。 it's like。

It's like hitting on a girl。By saying， hey， maybe we can go out sometime。

I've seen guys do that maybe we can go out sometime she's out now。Be out now， she's dressed。

What would you do if you were out with her then？Do it now half two hour sad。

As opposed to three minutes that get her number and then call her over to your house。

 people are shrinking it。 And the neat thing is， if you， if you lengthen the timeline。

 making it a natural love story， right， if you lengthen it， she'll short ending thing for you。

You know， if you have attraction， mutual attraction and mutual comfort。

You'll have mutual selection she to do you。Women are better at seduction than men or at least better than me。

 I agree，100%。Oh， you know， my structuring opportunities。

 structuring opportunities for her to gain us。That's right。It's a different narrative， by the way。

 one narrative is the guy chasing the girl。I don't like that narrative。

 I prefer the girl kisssing the guy， I prefer opening two groups of people。

 each with the hot girl in them。And letting them meet each other and fight over。A challenge is set。

It's a little harder work in that you have to open two sets。

 but then you have two girls who are frenzied for you。And you let one of them win win。

It's a different right now what advice I want to know your take on this because we just talked about the closing hours。

 So from meat to closing， generally， you just said that a passionate relationship starts very passionately。

 Now that's that's a great line。 I think that's a great expression。😊，Now。

 a lot of guys have problems with if they close too fast and they'll come and ask you questions like。

 well， I slept with her too fast too quickly。 Now she's ignoring me。

 she's blocking me or she's not talking to me anymore。

 I can't get her on a second day because we slept too fast？ Now， in your opinion。

 are there any ways to recover from this， Like， what would you say to the guy who comes to you with this question。

Well， that's what we call buyer's remorse it's because it' compromised her comfort levels and you know。

 over your bounds， if you call her again， she knows she just wants sex。Right。

You don't want to be her friend。So。I resolved that by knowing that it takes generally seven hours。

 you know， based on my successes and the successes of dozens of other PoOAs around the world that I've had the good fortune to gain with。

That reminds me by the way one。Com in the thread that all the great Pas that I've met around the world possess in their sets。

A laugh track。If you have a laugh track in your sets。You are doing it right。

That the best PoAs who have women in their lives， they're laughing and smiling all the way to the bedroom。

That's very good the serious pickup trying to bet her with your seduction skills， I don't know。

 maybe there's guy who's out there's， you know， a great seducer。

maybe he's better than me at seduction。But I'm an attract。

 I'm very good at attracting a woman from within a group。

That's my skill set and I can teach that because what one man can do another can do。

 I believe in that strongly。I'll say this to in the event that you have sex quickly and you feel like you've triggered buyers' remorse。

 Post sex comfort。 You've got to make up ground in the comfort building stage now。

 if you didn't cover it initially。 you know， many women are used to guys slowing things down， too。

 So sometimes they will actually have sex quickly。 and then they'll pull back to see how the guy reacts。

 And this is where we have to keep our cool。 This is where we have to do post sex comfort。

That's the solution to， if， you know， the best way to handle buyer' remorse is to not get it in the first place。

 But when you get it， comfort， go back to comfort and attraction building material。

 post sex and slow the sex cart down again。Great become friend， great advice。 friend。

 Good great advice。Because a lot of people forget that after they get what they want。

Cause they just want the sex。 And once they get it， they forget the whole comfort thing。

 And the girls out the door and they over see her again。 Yeah Yeah。

 you don't want the girl feeling like she just unc the wild beast。 You know。

 you gotta put the beast back in the cage until it's ready to be unleashed again。 So yeah。😊，mh。

Mystery， let's talk about attraction because you just said that you're a big attractionor。

 and I know you're big on an attraction。 you have your own take。 you have your own ideas。

 your whole ideology。 I think mystery method is entirely built mainly focused on attraction itself。

 And this is what you used to talk about the male to female and the female to male attraction。

But my understanding is correct Well let's talk about the first the first phase is opening we've all talked about opening using openers will reduce your approach anxiety。

 but the next phase is where I demonstrate value。And she reciprocates with II。

 she shows me indicators of interest， IHV， she II in the second phase。Right， I show my best。

 I put my best foot forward， I create my first three minute impression with the story or two。

U clearly with humorous parts to it that's the whole point of the story to have a point the point of the story is to have a point right and usually you have a last point right well that's the second phase the third phase is the mirror opposite of the second phase。

Again， in the second phase， IHV and C Iis。哎，那那那。Third phase。

She is allowed to DHV to me by my asking her questions。

 and I like her showing indicator of interest for her having said for having her answer。

They're mirror opposites。So I attract her first。 She shows enough interest for me to then say， okay。

 slow it down speed Rar。 Is there Mor of that meets the eye， which is a qualifier question。

 She answers it。 She says， why， yes， there is。 And she gives me an answer that that is you know。

 compelling。 And I'll say to her no way。 Your first impression was sort of neutral。

 But now as I get to know you， you're quite incredible。 Very different from what I anticipated。

 I thought you were one of the zombies on the planet。 but you're not。If they don't。

 if they don't show attraction in the if they don't show attraction initially， are you。

 Are you gonna keep， you keep stacking or。Well， I'm not going to T。

What a lot of guys do is they go in the field， they talk to a girl。

 they may even banter out of politeness for five or 1 minutes。

And do not receive indicators of interest that are compelling from the woman and give up。

What I'd rather do is compel her to give me iOSis。I demonstrate higher value or do instant value demonstrations。

Right， like if you can sing and you sing in front of a girl or if you played guitar and you played the guitar in front of the girl。

 that could make the real difference。 You know， she can see your personality through your art。

 My heart is magic。😊，Some people's art， you know， especially in pickup most people。

 it's storytelling， right， it's the ability to spin a yarn， it's the ability to get people alive。

 it's it's telling comedic stories。Being funny， being witty， conveying these。

 and you can do that with the core list， with the list of the core material。To fulfillion。

At least three gambits for each phase。For the first four phases。

 until you have what we call consistency。You know， I remember this is a little story about Neil Strauss。

 who wrote the book The Game。That kind of started， right？Neale's first six months were hard。

 difficult。 can imagine In the first six months， he had no girl。 I watched it。

 I was there with him throughout it all。 I was having success。

 He wasn't is my little friend and I wanted to teach him。 And in the six months。

 what he focused on instead of trying to get a girl。 He focused on trying to get good at his gambits。

 In other words， being skill set centreed rather than in girls。 So in the first six months。

 he had no girl。But by doing it this way， in the second six months， he had 70。Sly。

So get good at the skill set and then use the skill set。

If you try to just use whatever skills you don't have。

 you're going to get some shitty results and you're not going to want to play any more。 And， in fact。

 you may even get bitter and angry and in hate women。😡，I personally love women。 I love women。

 I love women。 I love hanging out with them。 I love going out。 I love meeting them。 I love laughter。

 I love smiles。 We have some couple drinks Back to the pad。 Hang out。😊。

Put some music on maybe some snugling and cuddling this is it's a wonderful lifestyle， you know？

It's a very wonderful lifestyle。 a blaze。 You're very similar。 I mean， you fall in love。

He's had a few girl， for instance I've known him that he had fallen in love with。

 and now he's engaged。To be married， that's how in love he is。That is a big deal。That's a big deal。

 man。 Yeah， come come in。 And here it is。 I was already to release my book and travel the world with mystery and then boom。

 she had to come in and mess everything up mess。😊，That reminds me I did have。I did have a。

Tour in Europe。That I calledMyster a single tour。And then we went to Belgrade and the very first set on on the first night。

Turned into my girlfriend for four months。 So we had to change the name of my tour because the first night I met a girl that became my girlfriend。

 Myster is a longer single tour。 Nice， I wanted to add to what the original question， too。

 about if you don't get I O eyes from the girl right off the bat。 typically。

 when I'm going into a set and mystery does this as well。 We're not looking for。

 we don't want the woman to see us looking for I eyesis。

 We're running our material and we're looking for I eyes is on the sneak。 And if I don't see I eyes。

 I blind myself to it。 I I get fascinated by my own material。

 and I trust that the I eyes are going to come out at some point。 So don't go into the set， you know。

 wondering if the girls are attracted to you。 If you get level 1 attraction。

 this is what I call level 1 attraction where the girls instantly attracted to you and you see I eyes right off the open。

 great if we。Have that awesome。 If we don't have it， that's not an excuse not to go in。 go in。

 blind yourself to the responses you're getting run solid material。 You know。

 don't completely blind yourself。 If you're getting， you know， really negative social feedback。

 Certainly calibrate， but don't be too obsessed over the i eyes off the bat。

 Women are typically not attracted to men so quickly。 They see attractive men。

 And then five seconds later who does something。 And they go， oh， never mind。 right。

 So they're not so won over by your looks。 You know。

 let her acclimate to your manly face and your material and trust that the I Ois will come。

Nice listed I。I run gambits that get positive reaction smiles， laughter， twirling hair。

 things of that nature。You know， I will passively look for these indicators。

And when I have two or three of them， I'll then move forward， not to comfort， not to kissing her。

 I'll just move forward to qualifying。 It's a high valued male behavior to qualify a woman to ask her questions to could challenge her intellect and get her to answer thoughtful lay answer in a thoughtful manner。

Good stuff。I wanted to go back to what we said earlier because we got。

 we got to we got really excited talking about this。 You said a word earlier。

 A lot of dudes get frustrated into up hating women， which。Reminds me of the red pill community。

 And I want to get your take on that， because red pill。Has been big。Since after the book came out。

 I think red pill got big in early 201112 when it was starting。 So in China right now。

 in the past couple of years， I would say 4， five years， Red pills been really popular。

 And a lot of people have been reading and watching red pill content。Which start to make them。

 like you said， hate women。Hate themselvesca they're not getting results in their life。

 They're not getting results in their dating lives。 So what's your take on red Red pill。

That's a big one just came to my head。Just to minimize this this big topic for my own entertainmentments sake。

 the metaphor comes from。A movie comes from the matrix， yes。Red to， yes， red toe blue right？

UIf you've seen the movie。You don't have to take side。 you can be both you can have。

Cognitive dissonance and and havebo， you know， you don't want to be ripped off by women who say buy me a drink。

Right and then you buy their drink， she says thanks no fuck。That can happen right so of course。

 you don't want to be taken。Or a dumb situation that a blaze was in。

 do you remember that in Kiev or in Odesssa？Oh man。 Do I even want to tell that story。

 want to tell that story， but it can happen。 This is， you know。

 what people are are afraid of happening right， you want to tell that story。 I'll tell the story。

 I'll give the condensed version real quick。 So I was in Odesssa。 We were doing the boot camp， right。

 I met a woman online。 I met up with her。 we went to a bar。Had some food， I think， had a few drinks。

 She was with a friend， by the way， which was the first kind of red flag。 Okay， she was， you know。

 speaking English to me on the app。 And then all of a sudden。

 she had a friend with her as a translator。 My spidey senses went up。

 But these girls did a good job of building comfort with me at at a few venues。

 And then we went to a club of their choosing。 Okay， we got a hookah。 We got a fruit platter。

 We got a crfffe of vodka or dancing and all this。 I told the server nobody puts anything on the tab except me。

 okay。😊，The end of the night， he brings me this tan。 Min you， I've been doing a math in my head。

 Okay， I wasn't falling over drunk or anything like that。 I had my wits about me。

 They bring me a bill for like $2000。 Okay， There's no way it was $2000。

 I was expecting to pay1000 bill。Maybe  a hundred50 tab。 I mean， we were in the VIP section。

 If we're going to go to the club， let's do it right， You know， we had a good time and everything。

 But $2000。 I took this bill， and I threw it up in the air like this。 And I said。

 get this the fuck out of my face。This again， why do I even want to tell this story， Okay。

 the next story。 long story short， long story short。I had two big bouncers screaming in my face。

 I was refusing to pay this tab。 Don't ask me where this came from。

 But I finally decided to act like I was some big shot。 And I pointed in the guy's face， And I said。

 O， I'm gonna to pay this bill。 But when I get back to Chicago。

 I'm gonna to make big problems for you and you and you。

 I pointed at these guys like I was some big shot。 Who the hell am I， right。

 so I ended up paying them a few hundred bucks， and I got out of dodge。

 But these women were in cahoots with this。 So they were going back。

My quick thing on the red pill is learn a bit about the red pill， but don't become consumed by it。

 right， too many guys learn a little bit about the dark aspect of female nature。

 and then they dwell on it。 They go down this rabbit hole。 Learn a little bit about hypergamy。

 Learn a little bit about female nature。 The dark side of women。 They're humans， too。

 They're allowed to have a dark side。 too。 like men don't have their dark side。 You know。

 but learn a little bit about it and then get on to playing the game。 We're about playing the game。

 We're not about sitting around discussing how terrible women are。

 And that hasn't been my experience either。 I've met some women that fall into this。

Category that the red pillilt dwells on。 They're not for me。 You know。

 I get those women away from me， and I focus on the vast majority of women who are wonderful people。

 qualify， qualify， qualify。 It's so important。 It's a phase in the structure。 Qify the girl。

 Look for red flags。Ask her questions that get her to think so that she's not just giving you standard answers。

 you know， no yes or no questions。On that note， let's take a turn here。 A Blalaze， I。

 I like your story about you just said about your experience about paying a big bill at the。Bar。

 which leads to I think that's you like it which leads to my next question。

 which is really good'cause mystery talks a lot about attraction and being high value'cause we mentioned that a lot being high value。

😊，Now。What do you tell the guys who are， you know， in in in China or in any other Asian countries like Korea and Japan。

 in China， especially in， let's say， Taiwan or mainland， China and Hong Kong。

That they have this belief growing up that high value only means having enough money to women。

 where they believe that I need to have enough money to attract women。 And if I don't。

 I have low social value， Low social status。 No one's gonna talk to me。 I'm not。

 I don't have the ability to pay， pay for stuff and be a provider。 Yada， yada， yada。

 What's your take on their thought about having money equals high value。You can't bring your money。

Into the club， in amazing ways other than flash cash。 you can have some flash cash。

 You can maybe buy a bottle， but you can't bring your car into the club。

 You can't bring your mansion into the club。 You can't bring your yacht into the club。

You have to gain， son， you got to open the set。Stack openers demonstrate higher value， qualify。

 move the set into a sit down situation so that you can build comfort。

 See all that has to happen anyway， whether you have 100 dollars in your pocket or 1000。

 It doesn't change the game。The whole point of having some flash cash is to show her that you're not going to mooch off of her。

That's it that's going it's not out to impress her with my flash cash， Oh look at me。

 I've got money right， this is personality conveying game。

We're going to win a woman's heart bikeker with our personality， not with our accolades。

What do you tell the guy and what do you， what do you guys tell the guy who's。

 who doesn't have enough money？ So he doesn't have enough confidence to go and approach。 Like。

 what do you tell a guy like that。 What do you say to， So here。

 can I take this one mystery real quick， because I actually talk about this extensively in my upcoming book。

 the vortex of love Ding so I like to think of all of the evolutionary and economic mate selection theories as standard value。

 Okay， we know women are attracted to across culture across time， They're attracted to resources。

 They are attracted to money。 They're attracted to big muscles。 They're attracted to survival value。

 Okay， but there are other mate selection theories， for example，idealdeal make theory。 I M T。 Okay。

 this says that every woman has a unique psychology based on her upbringing。

 What does she find valuable。 Okay， so you got to get once again， similar to the red pill advice。

 Learn a little bit about the standard value stuff。

 What are women attracted to on the whole and then get on to developing your own unique displays of value。

 right， your' U VP， your unique value proposition， I assure you there are plenty of women out there。

 that are not going to trade you in for the the the CEO of the company， right， your're hardworking。

 You're a kind man。 you have nice personality。 You have hobbies。

 don't dwell on the standard value stuff。 Learn a little bit about it and then just put your blinders on and develop a style of game that is right for you。

 Don't get discouraged， but I promise you， there have been times in my life where I had money。

 There have been times in my life where I was broke。 There have been。

my life where I was in between and I had plenty of love in my life。

The game will smooth over a lot of this It needs to be broke。Mr， please talk about this。

 thing that I got， even though it was broke least I got girls talk about when you were broke。

 talk about when you were broke and still talk about when you were broke and you still were able to attract women。

Well， I started out in pickup。In Toronto。And。I have a good hundred nights out under my belt。

Where I didn't talk to anybody。I just went out to observe。I didn't have the guts to talk。

I would say things like excuse me， do you know time it is， thanks that would be。

Huge for me when I was in my， when I was 19， 20 years old， I didn't lose my virginity till 21。

But I had a lot of outings wearing a bomber jacket， not dressing up for the party。

 not looking like you're， you know， like you belong there。是这是。Guy off the street， not smiling。

Just十个听庆。Just gawking， not being the life of the party， not joining the party， not adding value。

Right， not opening sets。So I I think。What happened is I just had enough。

 I wanted to have fun out there。So I came up with a rudiment tree。

Structure at the time called EthMac。Find meat attract clothes you have to find them you have to get out of the house and go to where you know some public gathering day or night and then you have to。

😡，After you find them， you have to meet them。You have to actually meet them。 I'm so sorry， Gu。

 You want to meet your next girlfriend。 You're going to have to have the courage to face her head on and to strike her hard。

Just like killing Dr， you have to face them head on them and strike their heart。

 You're going to have to face beauty。 You're going to have to meet them。

 Then you're going to have to say something to her and her group to attract her。

 to get peer approval。And then finally， as a way point。

 you're going to have to ask for her contact information if she doesn't bother to ask you first。

So youve got to get good at these basic phases， find FMAC， find me attract clothes。

And get good at each phase。 And you can fill in the faces with material。 Now。

 it's since become more advanced。 My M3 model doesn't just go to get in a phone number。

 It goes all the way to sex。That's courtship。Right pickup is from me to phone number or me to makeup that's pickup。

Then there's mid game， What do you do on a day two？

What shared activities do you embark upon experientially with her while you're telling her stories about your life？

And then finally， seduction， not only logistically， where are you going to have it。

RightHow are you going to get her there with comfort。

 but how are you going to set up the situation so that that she seduces you？

What I've learned is if I slow down the game。I'm structuring opportunities for her to pursue me。

By slowing down the game。By saying， let's slow this down speed racer。By means slowing it down。

 she can speed it up。And they often do。There's， there's a set of phases in pickup。

 and there's a set of phases all the way in courtship all the way to beginning a sexual relationship。

 If you know the phases， then you know the structure。

 I suggest people know the phases and know what phase they're in when they're in it。

 not just know it theoretically， Oh， I read a book 20 years ago。

 And now I don't know what phase I'm in when I'm in I'm talking to a girl， So it didn't help。

 it's practical knowledge， it's supposed to be useful in field， And when I'm in an a1。

 the first phase of attraction I'm opening， Do you have openers， Do you have a false time constraint。

 are you able to run successive openers in case the first opener doesn't work。 you know。

 or do you lose the set。 You gotta like a comedian hang in their son。 Buck and Bronco。

s so visceral playing this game is visceral， Its it's lively， right。

Be alive and cognizant of and living in the now to appreciate the set you're in and to run it。

As opposed to， I hope she likes me， she didn't show me interest in the first minute。

I don't know what to talk about。That's a it's a losing battle if you do it that way。

 if you know your material to fill in the structure and you know the structure and you get good at the delivery of it。

 you're going to be well underway way to getting good at this。P Q。Good stuff。

 So we talked about money just now。 and what your take on that is is to still work on the guy's game。

 work on his own personal development， work on his game， work on his method。

 work on his taking action。 That's what I got out of that。 And what I yeah， yeah。

 so what I wanted to ask you coming off of that is the second big question that most of our viewers have is H。

So if you don't mind me asking， how old are you now。I am now 53 years young，53 years young， and。

Still got the long hair。 Still got the hair。 nice， boom， nice。😊。

The gray is starting to show and I'mle it。You're not You， you're， you're not dying your hair at all。

Well。I've got a little bit of gray on the side here and see these wisdom lines。

They never slowed me down。They convey wisdom， they convey a maturity。Right。

 and I am supposed to nowadays be going after older women。You know， mis， otherwise。

 I'm hanging out with 21 year olds still。 How are they， Yeah， So that's what I want to ask。

 How are they them still exactly， Wow，21 year olds are still threatened because I'm an older man and like。

Got my finances handled and， you know， and I tour the world。You know。

 I have a lifestyle that they'd like to join。So。I have to say no。To them。

 because I'm looking for a travel partner for a companion， someone who looks good with mystery。

 mystery and。W， right？Now my my relationship life is complicated， you know I have a baby mama。

 I've got two kids， I've got like a massive of heartbreak throughout my whole life I've been dealing oh your mystery you know。

 you must be sleeping on a bed full of， you know， a pile of women and you know they're swinging off the chandelier。

 right？I have slowed it all down to finding what I'm looking for that's what I'm not doing and I'm very actively looking。

That's why I came to San Diego。It's also warm and the girls are in sun dresses out here。

So age is not an issue at all。I would say if a girl asks to your age and you're older， don't flinch。

Don't flinch， good advice， you know， I can always say here。

 feel the sexy boy skin and to think you're never allowed to cut to。Yeah。

 too many people are very concerned about their age。 They think that they're tooled for this。

 especially guys who are going into their  for0s。 We， we have a lot of clients who are， you know。

 in their mid and late 30s and some are in their 40s。And a lot of fans asked this question， too。

 in our videos or our live stream， they say， am I too old to start this。

 And I think one of the best examples was Neil Strauss。

 because when he met you and when he started this， he was not at he was not in his 2s when he started this。

Yeah， he started a little later in life I started at 21 best late to， you know。

 when you want to start at 16， you know you want a girlfriend at 16 17 18 1920 come on already it's time to have a girlfriend you know。

You can start at any age， I really believe that some people have， you know， they married their child。

 their high school sweetheart， they were with her for 20 years and either she passed away or divorced them and he has heartbreak and has to move on and has decided to love again。

As opposed to just go off himself。There is love out there， there is a woman for you。Yeah。

 and what's the other option give up？You know， that's your other option is give up。You know。

 I have seen guys make dramatic transformations at all different ages。 You know。

 if you immerse yourself in this， if you get into game， if you make it a priority， you will improve。

 there are guys that start training jujitsu in their 40s。

 I just started training jujitsu again about a year and a half ago。

 I have a little bit of a martial arts background from when I was younger。

 But I took a major hiatus off a training。 And I went， man。

 am I really going start training jits at 40。 You know， yeah， and guess what。

 I found out you can actually get pretty good。 You can get your black belt at 48 or 50。

 and tear people's heads off。 You know， it's the same with the game。

 Who cares how far down the path you've gone。 It's never too late to change the road that you're on。

 That's a lyric from stairway to heaven to， by the way。 So yeah。

 don't compare yourself to others journeys。 This is your journey to the guys out there that are in the late 30s。

 their 40s。 I when you're。😊，When you're at this juncture， guys tend to go one or two ways。

 They either go fuck this。 I'm going to handle this or I'm going to die trying or they go， I give up。

 and they opt out of the game， and they live a quiet life of whatever。

 And I hope these guys find happiness。 I hope that they live out the rest of their days with some sort of peace。

 But man。😊，Why not just go for broke at that point。 What do you have to lose。You know， travel。

 go to new cities， it only takes three days to fall in love。You know。

 you can meet a girl and fall in love in three days and convince her to come back to your small town and visit you。

You know， as opposed。Oh we get a freeze here， Is he stuck？Brozen mystery。

I thought both of you were stuck。You he's back。We're back。 You're back。 you go。Yeah。

It internet connected ands。Technical difficulties， but will rise above them。

Have the courage no matter what age you are， to build a skill set。Focus on it。

Don't focus on trying to get the girl or you're going to get scared because you don't have a skill set。

No， you know， that's the fear。There is a way out。And that is to learn by seeking a mentor。

 going out in field with a mentor。And learning what he has to teach you because what one man can do another can do。

 so just follow along with the program。😡，Right， we do a three day boot camp。

It's called a boot camp for a reason because people are walking all lot on a boot camp。 By day。

 It's theory and seminar and lectures。 And by night。

 we take the gentlemen into nightclub environments， rooftop patios， bars， clubs。 anywhere。

 there's a lot of people so they can do a lot of groups。

 group interactions or sets in a short amount of time a dozen sets a night。You know。

 imagine doing three sets and coming back to me。And I give you feedback on what went wrong in those three sets and what I suggest would improve your next three sets。

 And then you just go do that for the next three sets。

 We do that throughout the whole night by the end of the night。

 your sets are running a lot smoother and a lot longer by night， too。

 we bolt on more material because there's holes in your game that you discover on night 1。

And on night， too， we fill in those holes。 We fill in， fill in the structure with material。

 We practice the delivery， and then we're out on field again。 and we go to public gatherings。

 You face beauty and you get a chance to meet the beautiful women we're meeting and interact with them。

 hopefully， for longer than 10 minutes。😊，Right， if not 25 to 40 minutes。

 if not bouncing them with us to the next venue， we always choose  two or three venues per night。

 That way， if the first venue sucks， we can go to the next venue。

 We can bring girls from the first venue with us to the second venue， sweetens the pot。Right。

 and that's kind of how we do it。 by the third night， students are， well。

 some of them are getting girls。You know， and others are getting lights at the end of the tunnel。

They see it， you know， they live in a tunnel and the darkness is there's this bright light at the end of the tunnel。

 and it is called having a skill set。Three days and three nights with both myself and with a blaze。

You're going to get good at something。 What is that something， It's your skill set。

 It's literally getting good at the gambits that fill the structure。You get good at that。

 and you can then rely on that material for what we need。6 weeks from now。

 woman of particular qualities is coming along。 If you don't think you have the skill set to get her now。

Respectfully。Then why not seek a mentor， train with him， gain with him。

 learn what good pick looks like so you can replicate it。And then when you meet your dream girl。

Unleash everything you've learned。I think that's a better game plan than just waiting six weeks all by yourself and then meeting her and not having anything to say。

That's going to change。That's good。 My， I wanted to ask you another question。

 This is another fan favourite。I want your honest take on this because I， I don't think you've。

 I don't know if you've been asked this question before。

And this is a question that a lot of Chinese men are concerned with， so。In China。

 most dating companies here， I would say a good 90% of them。 So 9 out of 10 companies here。

 they will do something。What we call in China， we call it展示面。 So what that is is。They take。

 let's say，40 clients or 60 clients， and they'll take them out。 They'll rent out。 let's say。

 about or a Ferrari or like a nice car or go somewhere with a nice view。

And they'll take turns taking photos for the entire afternoon just to post on their profile that they have all these luxury nice things。

 And they believe that the attraction that comes from women when you add them to your。

Your social media and woman sees this。 And that generates traction because women thinks you're rich or woman thinks you're successful。

And to me， I personally think that's， we have a word for that。 It's called a scam or a fraud。 lying。

 Yeah， so what's your take。 What is your take on this And giving to the students。Yeah， so what。

 so what's your take on building a。Unrealistic， high value profile。 So that attracts women and they。

 they meet this guy in person right， and they go on a date。 So what's your whole take on this。Okay。

 that's lying， I don't I don't agree with lying， you know， you could be broke and still be in love。

You know， you don't need to have a picture in front of someone else's car the rest you're only going to get a certain type of girl you know。

 yeah Okay， so here once again let know your thoughts on this because I don't even think this way once again。

 you have the standard value versus unique value kind of the economy here， right。

When you develop a style of game that is congruent with your personality， you become a razor。

 sharp sword instead of trying to adjust your game for this type of woman or this type of woman。

 right， I am much more a believer in。Honing in on the style of game that works best for you Now。

 you're going to think to yourself。 O， I won't get as many women this way。

 but I'll get women that are more congruent with my personality。 right， That's certainly true。

 But here's the paradox of it。 you'll actually have a larger pool of options because women can smell bullshit。

 and being a guy that isn't afraid to lead and be himself is a high value quality。

 So guys that are trying too hard to shape themselves into the ideal alpha male， right。

 the the tail's swift of ladies men。 You know， just the the cookie cutter。 it's， it's。

 it's misguided。 Look at mystery， look at mystery with this hat and his goggles and his unique look。

 you know， look， if you're really that guy， if you're the guy that drives the Ferrari own that shit。

 drive your Ferrari， Be the fucking Ferrari。 it's real。 if you're not。If it's real， if it's real。

 yeah， thank you， exactly， exactly。Drave someone else's Ferrari for 20 minutes， take a。Yeah。

 put them on your Instagram。And then tell them it's in the shop。It's when you pick her up by Uber。

That's funny yeah no I don't agree with any of that it reminds me of people who use other people's material。

 you know， and they don't change it to reflect their lives。They just lie。You know。

 I don't believe in lying。 You don't have to lie。 My 10 year old son has Dhvs。 You know， he's。

 he's won races and he's got D Hv's up the wazoo。 He's brilliant。 Should see his math skills。 I mean。

 it's， it's like a magic trick。 It's phenomenal to see his math skills。😊，See。

 I' I were already unloading DhVs about my son to you。

 you know if a son can have DhVs so can you their personality DhVs that's what they are they're not this is what I own you know come on we're trying to pick up women and have them fall in love with us we're not trying to scam chicks。

You know， women can see through your game guys they're as beautiful as they are on the outside。

 they're just as smart on the inside， I presume that the women I meet I give them the respect and dignity。

 I presume that they're smarter than me。They just feel good around me because I'm in a good mood and I've got interesting gambits to run。

 interesting topics to discuss。Very good stuff。 Now， on that topic。

 you speak about having your son and your daughter。 Now， when you're meeting women these days。

 does that topic ever come up， do women ask you， are you married， do you have kids。

 What do you respond to， No they don't bring it up， but I bring it up， you know， if I may。

 These are my children， Oh let me get rid of the nose， But generally。Then remembered。One sec。

 we could to get rid of this podcast interview。There we go， those are my kids。Beau kids。Thank you。

 beautiful daughter。 my daughter。 Yeah， beautiful daughter。And I will pull this out and show。

Proudly as a proud father， my kids to people， you know， on Thursday， I did meet a lovely woman。

And within five minutes， I brought that out and showed her that。I also showed her some magic。

 you know， which I。What well do now。Itll blow your mind though。And women don't mind that you。

 mystery truly， mystery truly has magic。 Do You think magic is real， Brian。

I have seen his earlier days where he was in a magic show and he was doing his magic performance。

 And I saw a few videos on YouTube。 I， I personally。

 I do believe it magic because I think performers have their。😊。

There's a lot of things that are magical about this world。 whether I think this is a belief thing。

 It's not， it's not like， if you don't believe that it's real， then it's not。

If you believe that it's right。 here's one for you， We were doing a boot camp in Belgrade。

 Serbia a few years ago。 Yeah， and we were walking down the main strip in Belgrade。

And we saw a girl probably 1415 years old， bolted across the street in front of us。

 And she's being chased by a group of young boys。 And at first， I thought nothing of it。

 I thought it's just kids being kids。 But something told me to look over my shoulder。

I look over my shoulder， and she's pinned up against the wall。

 and this guy is slapping her across the face multiple times in the middle with me in a side street in the middle of Belgrade。

 O， I looked at mystery。 He looked at me。 We pivoted。 We puffed our chest up。

 We just started charging right up to these kids。 Hey， hey， what are you doing， right。

 puffed my chest up。 I'm in this kid's face。 This kid， by the way。

 couldn't have been older than 1819 years old。 tattoos head to toe all over his face and everything。

 right， And I'm toe to toe with this guy。 And all of a sudden。

 everybody's face goes white and their eyes get wide。 Like they've seen a ghosts。I turn I look。

 and mystery has his magic wand out。 and he's pointing it at these guys like this。 A magic wand。

 He carries a magic wand， right， And they're all looking at him like， what am I witnessing right now。

 He turns sideways and vanishes the wand。 like pro pro illusionist type， you know。

 kid where the fuck did the wand go， right， And these kids scattered in all directions。

 Even the girl that we were helping out。 She like， you know， got wide eyed and bolted off， right。

 So we later found out。😊，these are kind of local gypsy kids。

 I don't know if that's the PC term or not。 Bless their hearts。

 But I guess they were local gypsy kids。 And they actually believe in magic。

 So when mysteryy pulled this wand out and vanished it， it freaked them out。 Now。

 here's the fucked up part。 We don't know。 Did we help this girl out。 You know。

 do they think that she's protected by magic now， or is she like， you know。

 excommunicated from the community， we don't know。 But what I will tell you is magic is real。😊，嗯。

ThatThat's very interesting。Yeah， the what I got from that was I feel like it's all in there。

 It's in here。For magic is real。 Yeah for well it's a state changer and an icebreaker。 Yeah。

 so you can change state。 You can break the ice。You know。

 I recommend everyone learn at least one piece of magic so that when they become a granddad。

 they get to show it to their grandchildren， and it takes you that long to get good at magic， right。

 It takes you that long to get good。 So you may as well start now。 And women love the magic。

 I promise you， guys。😊，They love magic。 It has its place in public gatherings， Not a card。 You know。

 don't pull up the cards Ca that it looks tri hard， But if you can vanish a cigarette。

 that's very within context of a nightclub。 you know， it's unexpected and it's delightful。😊。

Here's a question for you real quick， Ryan， did that story seem natural to you， extremely natural。

Up to the point where the， up to the point where the person vanished。

 that up to the point where the person， like all of a sudden like vanished like a。😊。

Just really quick。 you know， your viewers were asking， did the， is the material that we run。

 Is it robotic， Does it sound natural， Did that sound natural， That's that's a routine。

 That was that was a good story。 that That was a good story。 It really happened。

That really happened when we were in Belgrade。 I turned it into a routine。

 I ran it a few times in the club。 I taught it to the boys on boot camp。 You know。

 that's how routines are born。So good， that's from a real life story， not a made up。 So that's。

 that's the most important story。 because you guys actually experienced it in your life。

 And pulled out a wand。 Yeah， pulled out you actually pulled out a wand you have a wand on you。

 amazing out of your pocket。 You just like whipped it out。😊，I got the one in my pants。

 but I don't show it a later。😀Well。Yeah。Should we get a or L， let's do a bathroom break。

 bathroom and smoke break。That sounds like a plan。 Sounds like a good plan Yeah， yeah， yeah。

 I need to use that。Okay， we'll be back in five minutes。Five minutes， guys。

 everyone take yourself a break Yes five minutes sounds good。哦。Kate Blas'll see in a few mystery。

 why don't you mute your mic and turn your camera off。I'll do that， here we go。兄弟们，我们这是中场休息5分钟时间啊。

I got hit by the sprinklers。😀M。😊，Did you yeah， lets Mr。 sprinkle just went on。

Is that what the kids are calling it these days？Okay， we're back now。We've been now， okay。

 so this is our first time。 we have mystery on my channel。 and we having a。

We have a podcast and a discussion here。 and hopefully it's not gonna be our last， right。

 first but not last。Great time so far。 I really enjoyed myself。 Thank you。 Yes。

 and we've been talking for about two hours now， for the final section of our podcast and interview。

 would you like to take some of our like live fan questions that's coming out of the comment sections。

😊，I think that would be great I hope they're good questions Yes。

 so I'm sure there's a lot of people who want to ask you questions right now as they're watching this。

Now， one question that I just saw right after you came back was someone asked about feminism。

 So have you ever approached or dealt with a feminist Because there's a lot of feminists in Taiwan。

 in China， A lot of guys meet these girls online or in person right， at a club or during day game。

And a lot of these girls are， you know， they're very active， very aggressive。

 sometimes have their own strong ideas and very。Kind of like a lot of feminists think like a man。

 So have you dealt with that kind of situation， Like， have you ever dealt with feminists in your。

 in your。 Well， let I understand it by the definition of feminism， I'm a feminist。

 I believe in the equality。 So am I。 Yeah， so am I。 Right， I mean， we grew up in Canada。Right。

Equality is how I roll。So I don't know any other way。You know。

 I think that I think that feminists have a lot more in common with the pickup community and this。

 the manosphere than people realize， you know， feminists are into sociology and psychology。

 They're into male， female dynamics and human human dynamics more broadly。

 They're into learning about this stuff， you know。But in general。

 we try to leave politics out of our coaching。 You know。

 and feminism has become a very politically charged term now， you know， it's it's。Typically。

 you know， releg， you know， relegated to one side of the political spectrum。 So I。

 I would love to get on some podcasts with feminists。

 I would like to have these discussions because I think there's a lot more common groundments given credit for。

 And when feminists complain about。Pick up， you know， I think some of their。

 their arguments are valid。 You know， there are aspects of this industry that need to be cleaned up a bit。

 but we're doing our best to teach guides。Real social dynamics， you know that that。

That work and are respectful to women。 You know， we're not out here trying to pull the wool over anyone's eyes。

 But and then more specifically， Ryan， the women that are more。

Masculinized or whatever that are whatever。 I mean， again， it comes down to each person's preference。

 If a guy wants to be with a feminist， a woman that's taking on a more masculine role。

 I'm not here to judge that。 You can use all the pick up concepts and calibrate it to getting your type of relationship。

 So more power to you。If that's what you're into，100%。ALot of women out there cus from。Yeahep。

Second question we have here， he said， at what point of your life should a person decide to get married。

 How did you get married to did you， how did you manage to game while being in an exclusive relationship or in your state of marriage。

Okay， well， I've never been married。I have two children， but mom and dad don't get on。

 so we've moved on from that。And I have had long term relationships where they would travel with me。

Sim that， they traveled with me and we would go do boot camps together。So your partner。

 your your baby mama， she's okay with you taking her， going to pickup， going to date。

 going to all these things like she she's here。It是。Moved on。In the same way I've moved on。

She has no say in the matter， I'm going to do what I do。I just want to make my children proud。

 that's all you know I want them the television show I did on VH1 called the pickup artist it's online do your peer to peer search and you'll find。

That online， if you're into pickup， you're going to genuinely love。で。

Television show and it was something that I was proud of。Pro enough to continue teaching。

What I teach within the show after the show。So I went to Europe and aside from seeing my children as much as I could。

I would tour Europe teaching men in the elegant Art approach pickup， you know， the science behind it。

 the art of it， how to deliver your gambits in an effective manner， how to develop your own gambits。

I think good。You know， how to get how to get consistency in your pickups as well， you know。

 see the girl get the girl as the idea。Okay， let's move on to the next question。

 This is a really good question。 I think a lot of guys wanted to know this because you talked a lot about the nightclub scene and you like night game a lot。

 And you talked about the patio setting， which I know it's not very loud。

 Like patio settings is good for game， but。What's available to a lot of these guys in China when they go on in game is actually really these loud bars and clubs。

 and they're not able to speak where the women don't hear them。 And， you know。

 they'd be yelling out of their lungs and nobody can。Hear what they're saying。 So their question is。

 how can I be doing storytelling or even communicate and talk to them if the club is too loud。

What's your take on that It's a very real world issue， Some venue are loud。

 What I recommend is in every venue， there's always a chat zone。 There's a quiet area somewhere。

 even if it's outside of the club。 Y， right， I've been in situations where I've gotten to the club would light up a cigarette outside and meet the girl where I didn't have to actually go inside。

Right it's loud in there guys， but that's what draws the women。

 the music draws the women they want to dance women always want to dance right so what we can do is run the set for three to five minutes。

And then move the set to the quiet area here， come join me for a second。

 I'm going to introduce you to some good friends of mine。 See that sound bite。

 It's one of many sound bites。 Let me introduce you to some good friends of mine and backwards merge to a previously open set in the quiet area。

😊，Right， we do the best we can， it is loud and there。

 but you know pickup is the exception to the rule。the rule generally being that there's low conversion in the nightclub。

 you know， most girls I'm noting go in packs of girls and they go home alone and they lose。

 they lose。You know， if they lose number of times。Then they're going to lose the game。

They can price themselves out of the game entirely if they don't select someone in mating season or they have to wait till next mating season。

Summers sorry springs rather spring fever， maybe you've heard of this。

 this phenomenon that women are looking for a man in the spring and by the fall they have a man you know。

To cuddle with in the winter。Spring fever is a real thing guys。

 it's it's winter's coming now train now。Or spring Fe of 2025。

You want to be out there and you want to have your skill set developed。 Otherwise。

 you're going to be wondering， how do I open， What do I say， What do I do after I say that。You know。

 what do I do to attract her？How do I get her to invest？

How do I make her comfortable with me so she knows I'm not after anything in particular， you know。

 how do I let go of my outcome so that I can actually genuinely get to know this girl those are the questions that you should be working on you know those are the things you should be working on。

Ablaze you seem like you have a thought to share。You know， yeah， the loud clubs are。

 that's a real obstacle to contend with。 You know， there's got to be a chat zone somewhere。

 and you got to work the chat zones。 can you do dance floor game。 You can。 I've done it as well。

 you know， calibrated dancing， dancing towards her and then dancing away from her， you know。

 and a bunch of nonverbal energetic exchanges taking place。 You know。

 you can work your game to a certain degree， just with body language and， you know。

 positioning yourself in the right ways。 But at some point， you know。

 you have to have a conversation where your words are entering her ears and her brain is processing the words。

 right， This is conversational Venusian arts that we're， that we're doing here so。😊。

Find a different club。 If it's really that bad。 If it's one of those clubs where you can't escape the noise。

 then you got it， you got an uphill battle in that place。 Then what are you going to do。

 get a VIP section and buy bottles and just， you know， whole girls to your table。

 And then you still can't talk to them。 You know， I don't。 It's not my scene。It's， if I'm there。

 if I wind up there， I'm going enjoy it。 I'll embrace the moment， certainly， but it's not ideal。

 It's not a rooftop patio。Las Vegas。Very loud clubs in Las Vegas。

 Some clubs seem have to leave the club to make a phone call。Right， very loud。

 so don't go to those ones that's all。Because you're looking for a girlfriend aren。

 so you don't go to， you know， a place that isn't conducive to pick up。Right like the men's washroom。

 you don't go to the men's washroom in order to pick up a girl， do you。

 it's not conducive to pick up if you can't conversate。With the woman， converse with her。

 then you can't run conversational pickup。Right， then what are you reduced to， you know。

 maybe there's a life band。And it's getting in the way of you having a conversation with the woman because it's their set。

 it's their group of people paying attention to the live band if you want。Start a band， I make music。

 I've made half a dozen songs already that I share with women。You know， get it， get into。

The performance of something convey your personality。Whether it's singing， whether it's magic。

 whether it's storytelling， you have to do something to convey your excellence。Why not all of it。

 That's how I do it。 I do love it。 The loud club is where you take a group of people。 You know。

 meet at a friend's house， have a party， go to the loud club for a few hours and then leave and go back to the after party where you can converse again。

嗯 interestinging。Okay， let's take one more question。 A guy said。

One of the fans said if a girl mentioned that that she has a boyfriend。

 but she still shows I O I off the approach and she's even willing to go on an instant。

 let's say go watch a movie or go to the theater or go for coffee， should I keep chatting her up。

And how do I close， And should I be doing this if a girl mentions I have a boyfriend。

 but she's still。Stser or。Complies。Just because she said she has a boyfriend doesn't mean she does。

 It just means you hit on her in such a way that made her feel uncomfortable and have to say that。

It is a way of getting rid of the barrage board and boyfriend。Oh yeah。

 really nice shoes thanks my boyfriend bought for me boom lockout right it doesn't mean that she does have a boyfriend。

 it just means she doesn't want you hitting on her anymore。

so she uses that as her excuse as if it's going to work。I don't get it。

I don't get I have a boyfriend。Reason is because I do microcalibration when I show an indicator of interest。

 I calibrate it with an indicator of disinterest， for instance I can say you have beautiful eyes。

Can I touch。拜拜。So the U of beautifulut eyes is the Ii。 and the can I attach them is the Iod D。

 You can do the opposite， too。 You can do an Iod D with an I Oi。 You can say， oh you little shit。

 Get over here， hug。If I just say get over here， she may not want to hug me， but if I say。

 oh you little shit， get over here， hug。I'm much more likely to have her comfortably uglymin。

And the power of anyquino is in the roll off。It's not in hugging her。 Yes。

 she becomes physiologically accustomed to your touch， but that the power of Kenno is in the roll of。

It's in letting go before she feels discomfort。And being cognizant of her comfort levels at all times。

 that's what comfort is a face。There's three phases to the stage of comfort。There's C1。

 C2 and C3 C1 is in the attraction location， you know， the quiet area where you can chat。

Perhaps away from the speakers。You know， more at the bar area。Then there's mid game， C2 comfort。

 you know， like getting a bite to eat that melts diner on Sunset Boulevard and then C 3 is her living room or your living room even better。

There's a lot of comfort taking place， right？There's a lot of phases in comfort。

In the first comfort phase。I'm concerned about trust。

 I'm just establishing enough trust so that she will safely bounce from one venue to the next with me。

Then we're in the C2 location and my focus is on connection。With C2。I'm connecting with her。

 I'm having genuine discussion with her we're talking。We're getting to know each other。Right。

 talking about。How I became who I am talking about stories that make me who I am and her reciprocating as well。

 telling me the stories about her life。And then in C three in the living room。

 I'm concerned about intimacy。Because intimacy leads to arousal。Intimacy leads to seduction。

So I break up comfort into those three main phases， trust。Connection and intimacy。

 And if you have gambitets or material to fill in each of these phases。

 at least core material that you can rely on when you run out of stuff to say。

 that's really going to save you from， from awkward pauses。Or ciing pausees even worse。

Those are my thoughts on that matter， a blaze。So。Yet， like mystery said。

 we shouldn't be getting the boyfriend objection。 If we do。

 I guess it depends on how much of a connection I feel with her。

 Are we talking about 25 year old ablaze， Are we talking about 35 year old a blaze 25 year old a blaze men have ignored the boyfriend objection。

 and ran his game anyway， Let's see how much this guy really means to her， You know。

 generally speaking， if a girl has a boyfriend， Well， again。

 I'm engaged right now so putting myself back in single mode。

 if I was talking to a girl and I found out she had a boyfriend。

 if I really felt a strong connection with her Like I'm talking， you know。

 this is girlfriend material right here that going， part of the question was。

 should I be gaming a girl with a boyfriend， I don't know。 You know。

 that's the decision you have to make sort of on a case by case basis。 for my understanding in China。

 theres a ratio issue， there's more men and less women， So maybe many women will have boyfriends。

She's not married yet。 Does she have kids yet。 I don't know。 I can't answer that on a。

 on a moral ground。 You know， in general， I try not to wreck connections unless I think there's real potential。

 If I'm just looking to hook up with somebody and I'm saying， man， this girl's hot， but nothing else。

 I'm probably not gonna。Disrupture relationship。 I'm going to let her go。

 There's plenty of efficiency。 I operate from a frame of abundance。

 So I had met a woman this many moon ago。 That was a long term relationship in time。

 And in the first three days， she never told me she had a boyfriend until it was too late。Right。

 it wasn't until the third day when I was leaving the house with her holding her hand and she let go of my hand and public like that I went。

 Okay， something is up。 And I said， what's up And she said it， well I have a boyfriend and I'm like。

Well， you don't now。Clearly， you've been with me for three days。

 And then when I invited her to the next city because I was on tour。She showed up。

She became my girlfriend for three years。so。If you microcalibrate。

 which is written about in the book Revelation， that love drop pen。

Boyfri objection won't even come up。Whether she has a boyfriend or not。

You never give her reason to use the boyfriend objection on you。And I'll say this， too。

 since most of your， since there's a huge percentage of guys that are in the day game。

 when you get the boyfriend objection off a day game approach， it's done。 It's usually done。

 You do some sort of direct approach and tell her she's pretty and blah， bla， bh。 Sorry。

 I have a boyfriend。You're usually not overcoming that woman。 We we do indirect approaches。

 We initiate the conversation without telegraphping interest on the open。

 That's what indirect opening is about。There's no reason when I say nothing can wreck this day。

 My friends and I conducted a caper， and were now celebrating like the innoot 11。 She can't say。

 I have a boyfriend。 That'd be weird。And I have a boyfriend minimizer。

 I simply say we're all seeing someone。That's how I minimize that， but it so rarely comes up。

Because I'm opening indirect， I'm showing that I'm an interesting person。

 I'm then showing curiosity about them genuinely， you know， not asking so do you have a boyfriend。

 I don't ask that。I don't bring that up。 She doesn't bring up。 I have a boyfriend。You know。

 we my material is too good， we're talking about different topics， it never comes up。

You could say yes， sure you do。If you want to throw a little egg in there， I have a boyfriend。 Yeah。

 Okay， or if you want to， you can say， you can say， oh。

 boyfriend Co I was wondering if you were looking for a husband。嗯。I listen。

 I've gone the down the rabbit hole of boyfriend destroyers and overcoming the boyfriend objection。

 And generally speaking， I'm not a fan of it。 Not a fan of overcoming shit tests either。

Girl gives a little shit test， and we overcome that。 I've done all that， too。 And in general。

 when the girl shit testing me too hard， I go， okay， you're losing me。 And I mean it。

 I'm not just pretending I she's really losing me。 You know， it's a red flag。😔。

Let's take one let's take one last question。 We didn't actually get to ask this。

 And I think they want to know the answer to this。 A lot of people probably wanted to ask this was doesn't matter if we're doing。

 let's say if the person is doing， let's say an indirect approach or a direct approach。

 but they're more concerned with the way they look。 So some guys are concerned。

 especially in China they they would ask things like， well， if I'm too short， let's say I'm165。

168 c or if I'm 172 cent， I'm not that tall， I not that go looking。Even if I go indirect。

 girls will look at me and they'll turn away。Mystery， what do you say to that。

 if it's negative future time projection， you know， if， you know， thinking about the future。

If you think negatively about the future， here's what I suggest。Don't game。Stop， stop chasing girls。

Don't invite girls into your life。 Don't go to the party。That's it， you're out， you're not allowed。

That's what I say。 You're not allowed。No one's inviting you to the parties， you can't go。偶尔。

You can suck it up， get in there and make it happen。

womenome are choosing based on the type of make it happen guy you are。

So if you can't make it happen she's not going to be impressed by you that's why girls gift shit tests。

 which I call congruence tests they're testing for their for your congruence you know you say you're a certain type of man and then you behave differently that's a red flag for her right。

So just get out there， get to the party because if you don't go， no one will miss you。

 no one misses you at the party because everyone else is at the party， they're having fun。

Get to the parties， you're going to enjoy them。They're fun， that's why people do it。

I overheard a conversation one time at a restaurant。 There were three girls sitting next to me。

 and I kept hearing the word hot， ugly guy， hot ugly guy。 They said it multiple times。

 when I finally over the shoulder open， I said。Hot， ugly guy， you know， what is what's a hot。

 ugly guy。And they proceeded to tell me about one of their friends who they know is objectively ugly。

 He's not a good looking dude。 He's short。 He's got a bad complexion。 He's got bebalaldings。

 not a classically good looking dude。 But his charisma is personality， make him hot。 They said， like。

 we don't even look at him as an ugly dude。 He's hot。 right。 And I was like。

 So is there such thing as， as an ugly hot dude。 And they went， oh， yeah， we have this friend that。

 you know， objectively， he's really attractive。 but he's so negative。 And he's， you know。

 he always gets the bad angle of you when he takes a picture and just he sees the negative and everything。

 And he's， you know， objectively a hot dude。 but we all think of him as ugly。

 So there are ugly hot dudes， a hot， ugly dudes out there， you know。🤢。

And here's the other cool thing about it。Good game can get you women that are a few points more attractive than you。

 I'm not big on rating people 1 to 10， but if you're a5， gets you some  sevens， man， you know。

 maybe a wayward 8 from time to 10。 you're rating women focus on the game。 You know。

 I'm not rating women in Who is sense。 you get it。😊，For this topic。Good。Good stuff， man。 I'm， I'm。

 I'm so。I'm， Im， I'm super excited。 I I， I was super excited to have you guys on my。

 on my show on my channel。 This is a， this is a moment for me personally。😊。

Cause I' I've came a long way and I really appreciate both of you guys coming on here and having this collaboration and。

At the end， do you guys wanted to say something about your upcoming workshop。

 people want to know what are your trainings coming up and your course is coming up this？

Cal approach pickup is an interesting topic。Blaze， maybe you want to tell everyone about our upcoming live online for those who can't come to a live boot camp。

 We have an offer。 We've had a few Chinese guys， too。

 I understand a big portion of your listeners are in China。 Taiwan。

 We had a guy from Taiwan our last live online as well。 We had a guy from India。

 But essentially what we're doing is  three small workshops。 at prices that anybody can afford。

 There's 150 option a $275 option and a $375 option or you can buy a bundle and get all three。

 The first workshop is starting in five days。 We're going to be going over a variety of topics。

 There's gonna be a lecture component and a Q And A where you're gonna get to actually interact with mystery。

 This is a mystery LED event It's going be 90% mystery。 I'm going to be there doing maybe 10%。

20% of the topics just kind。Keeping everything on track。

 But you will get to meet the man mystery for a handful of dollars。 Okay。

 we did these live online workshops in the past for $1500，$2300。

 Most of the guys that wanted to train with us。 had $200，$500 $600。 So I twisted mystery in arm。

 And I said， let's do something for the guys that couldn't normally afford to train with you。

 and you know， he con it。 he said， all right， let's do it。 So no excuse November。

 we call it no excuse November， because I don't want to hear any， I can't afford it。

 If you can't afford 1 hundred50 bucks。 we talked about guys that are broke， right。

 there's a level of broke where you got to get your shit together。

 You don't have to be the richest dude in the world。

 But if you're flat broke and you can't afford $1 hundred50 seminar， for example。

 then you got a level up your your money game。 So we have these three live online workshops coming up。

 And then I'll say this too we have。2025， we have some boot camps coming up。

 There are boot camps with me and mystery。 There are boot camps with Beexter and mystery。

 We're gonna to be in San Diego， Las Vegas， Austin， Texas， Nashville， Chicago， New York。 Cancun。

 Los Angeles。 right， This is all 2025。 We've got Mysteries01 visa renewed。

 He's ready to work in the US and changed some lives。 and then one last plug， if I may。

 I mentioned this at the beginning of the workshop of the podcast here。

 But I have a soon to be released book coming out in January and February 2025。

 depending on how quick everything gets finalized。 It's the 250000 word book on the game。

 And it is a technical book。 It was inspired by Mysteries teachings。

 It's very similar to the M3 model。 I get into the technicalities of the game。

 It's not It's not fluffed up。😊，There's 250000 words of life changing stuff。

 So it's called the vortex of love。 I'm very proud of it。

 It is truly my biggest professional and personal accomplishment。

 So I hope you guys will pick up a copy of the vortex of love all And speaking of books。

 there's no doubt that books are a wonderful way to get the door open to begin the adventure of a lifetime。

 I have written some new books since the mystery method having a beautiful woman into bed。

 We've got revelation that is a classic now it's about microcalibration。😊。

How did I play calibrated game？That love drop had assembled and it's all about his adventures with me。

That's a great book， it's been turned into an audio book just recently， there's the Hay guys's book。

 it's a collection of 60 plus openers， it comes with the book of NAgs。

 which is 150 plus NAgs more than enough to understand how to make women laugh and not telegraph interest。

There areThere's a lecture series on my digital store as well。

 and you can access all of this right now at AskMystery。com。I'll say one more thing to， Ryan。

 if I could chime in。 We would love to one of these days come to China and do some kind of collaboration with you。

 So， you know， let's have that discussion as well。 like the idea。

 Let's talk about this after sounds good。 Oh， oh， yeah， but real quick。

 hope to see you there。😊，Okay， guys， I'm gonna wrap this up。

 Thank you guys both so much for once again coming here and mystery。 you were a big influence。

 I think not just only in my life。 but I think in a lot of Chinese guys who got into the pickup community。

 you're definitely one of the first guys that everyone started watching and reading about coming into here coming into this community and trying to change their lives。

 And I'm glad you're still around because at 5253， a lot of people think you're not around anymore。

 a lot of people thinks that you're retired， a lot of people think you went off doing your own thing。

 But this podcast， the very first one in front of a Chinese audience。

 solidify the fact that you're still here and you're still doing it and you're well and you're on your way and you're still gonna be continue doing this。

😊，So hopefully we will see you back here and hopefully visit China one day coming here to do an actual seminar in in in person。

 as well as maybe some boot camps in field。And then we'll talk about some collaboration also you're getting you a visa to China。

 we'll talk we'll talk all about this afterwards。 But once again。

 thank you both of you for being such a big influence in our community and setting the foundation in base for every other method and technical things that came out after your mystery methodca I know a lot of dating coaches。

Especially Owen and a couple of the guys that I know again， thank you so much。 Very work man。

 And we will leave on this note and this is Ryan， and I will see both of you guys next time。

Cers guys， cheer。啊啊。兄弟们。又回到了我和你们的这个时间里面，我和你们的时间里面又回到了我这里来了，什么感受？兄弟们。也可以，大家在直播间可以表达一下啊。

兄弟们可以表达一下我们今天两个多小时的这个。这个访谈啊这个访谈和连麦的机会啊，迷喃是一个其实我们也看到了，迷喃是一个。虽然他年纪很大，53岁对吧？很多敏感的话题啊，很多敏感的问题，你们其实想问的。

想知道的。今天呢我也基本上有跟他谈到，都有聊到。我知道很多人就是他们想要去了解这个所谓的这个祖师爷跟鼻祖，他对这些我们中国男人可能很在的问题。比如像展示面啊，什么钱啊，什么身高这些东西。

或者夜场里面很吵，对于这些话题，他怎么看待怎么看，他可以跟你分享一些什么样的东西。其实迷南嗯。糜喃他的性格就是这样的，你会发现他今天分享的很多内容啊，他今天分享的很多的内容，很多的干货，很多的操作。

我说句实话，就是20年没变，20多年没变。就他过去的其实很多模式呃表达的话其实他都是这样。😊，但是呢我在今天晚上的这个直播里面，我会分享一个我今天跟他连完麦这个20啊两个多小时以后。

我的一个感受和体会是什么？我也会把可能你们没看见的东西，但是我看见的啊，你们可能没有看见的东西呢，我也会分享给你们。这个呢也可以是。嗯，算算是一波干货吧，也也算是一波干货。所以兄弟们啊。

这就是我今天活动期啊，第二天活动期的这个福利给到你们，能把明楠邀请来。那么将来呢他可能也会来到啊中国大陆啊，也包括台湾。那么我呢会来安排这些事情。那么我跟他呢也可能会同场出现。

也包括其他C的任何一个导师。所以呢，明兰只是在我这里只是个开始，对吧嗯。我对他本人其实并没有那么大的好奇，但是一定是很尊敬和尊重他的。因为他的确是我进入这个行业以后嗯看的第一个人。我相信对很多人都是。

所以今天呢我代我我也代表了很多我们中国在这个game领域情感行业里面的很多粉丝，对于很多一开始就认识他的人呢，我也向他表达了我们。郑重的感谢啊和对他的尊重。最后呢，我也表达了嗯，然后呢。

他的感受你们可以去看这个回放啊，你们也可以去看这个回放。😊，嗯。嗯，那么今天的这个直播访谈啊，我们就到这里了啊。然后呢，今天是两个多小时，两个半小时时间。这个回放呢我会一直留在我的油管上面。

所以你们可以一直回来看。那么在我抖音部分呢，我可能会捡一些他讲的一些问题跟回答跟干货，我可以把它翻译了以后呢，放到了我的一些别的平台上面。兄弟们，今天的直播分享啊，我们就来到了尾声。

不要忘记啊给今天这期直播点赞啊，这也是我靠我自己的人脉和我的能力和我活活了，就是在这个行业里面活了十几年，过了十几年努力付出得到的结果啊，跟我自己后来成为今天这个样子都是一样的。他都是一种结果。

你能你能被行业里面最顶的人所认可，并且和别人平起平坐，并且被别人欣赏，能够跟你一起来做这些事情，一定是因为自己努力的。因为你要知道在15年前，我还是十8岁的时候。

我跟明南这辈子我都我都不认为我能跟这个人能见面，我都不认为能跟他有任何的联系。只是在书里面读到了一个我们讲神奇或者传奇的人物。啊虽然后来我的人生有了很重大的改变，我自己也去实战了。

那么也会后面会更加的我觉得。努力，因为本身我们自己这个团队，我和我的团队跟我背后的我们这个新世界这个团队啊，我梁叔，还有我们团队里的很多导师啊，古医生也好，醒也好，柏林也好。

我们都在不断的去学习和提升我们自己。所以最后在这里呢，我还要说一句，就是一定要去关注我们新世界TV这个频道。这个频道里面讲的干货内容才是真正的我们讲能改变一个人人生的心理层面的东西。啊。

很多迷喃其实今天提到的东西啊，全部都是跟技术方面有关的，跟框架方面有关的。跟他自己的呃，我们讲信念方面有关的东西。他说的东西很多东西是没毛病的，理解吗？没毛病的。

但是他说的很多东西呢并不能解决很多人内心的我们讲焦虑也好，恐惧也好，抑郁也好，这些体验也好。所以很多人可能连开始都没法开始呃，他说的其实没没有错，理解吗？他说的一点错都没有，只是说这个过程当中。

很多人在这个过程当中在实操的时候啊。😊，他可能没有办法去继续这个东西。因为他本身心里面人格层面就有很多的问题。啊，但是我们可以看到啊，糜兰几十年如一日，对吧？他自己的表达也好，对这东西的看法也好啊。

跟几十年前其实并没有变啊，那也跟我在书里面读到的，可能在视频里看到这个人也是一样的。所以呢你们继续持持续关注啊，如果没有给我点赞的兄弟们，记得点赞啊，给我把这个视频的赞点起来。同时呢记得去订阅我的频道。

这样你们会以后啊看到更多类似这样的内容，包括我自己的直播。那么今天的这个活动期啊，你们千万不要错过3天里面啊，这是我自己调动了这个资源带给你们的这个福利。今天晚上呢还有一期直播。

我会跟已经付费的啊会员去连麦去帮他们解决问题和啊跟他们去链接。所以兄弟们呢也可以添加我的联系方式R91pro。也可以Ran91PK也可以，Ran91CC都可以OK都可以活动期非常好的价格。

真的就是像白给一样的，你知道吗？你你知道这期会员带给多少福利了吗？这些会员除了你花钱买的会员福利本身，还有这种迷迷喃来到我这里额外的这些东西。所以我们是不断的在给价值的啊，不断的在给价值。

所以我自己呢也代表我们整个团队啊，我们整个后端啊，包括新世界TV这个团队，包括我们明年南极的这个计划，我们明年所有的课程计划和带学员出去探索世界的的计划，刚才我们也听到迷南说了一个重点。

跟我的看法一模一样，就他说如果你是个无聊的人，对吧？你是个无聊的人，你什么都没有。他说那你你也可以去旅游啊。他说你得去过自己的人生，你得变成一个有趣的人了。他这个话呢就是说的有点可能我们讲话糙理不糙。

所以其实也是一样的。他自己也是花了很多的钱跟实践，去探索世界。我们一直也是在做这个事情。所以你会发现到最后我们人的成长和我们所经历的一切，到最后是一个人全方面的成长，而不是整天脑子里面只有game。

那刚才其实也问了他一个问题，就是有些人他脑子里面全是game。他怎么他怎么把这个东西学game和人生去找到一个完整的一个平衡。他的win man其实也给了一些建议，对吧？也给了一些建议。

所以呢非常感谢大家。在在这里活动期啊，我再一次感谢所有报名的已经报名的人啊，一及一直以来持续支持我的兄弟们。作为我的粉丝，我希望你们是对我是无比自豪的啊。作为我的粉丝，我希望你们是自豪的啊。

你你关注的是我，而不是会有任何的我们讲羞耻感。😊，那么以后呢也会给你们带来更多的价值啊。我们今天的直播就到这里，我们明天再见。喜欢我的兄弟们记得点赞，然后添加我们的联系方式。
