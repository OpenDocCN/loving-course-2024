The things I'm gonna be helping you in here to me， I view it like it's almost like an emergency intervention like that's literally how I view it。

 like you guys view it like you're here taking a program here to learn something。

 I view it like a fucking emergency intervention because a lot of these areas if you don't have a good grasp with them cause major major problems in your life and conversely when you have a grasp with them are going to help you huge So the advantages that I have due to my understanding of these particular areas are tremendous。

 I mean， I live in almost a completely different reality than the vast majority of people and yet the skills I'm going to show you are very learnable。

 they're very， very learnable and they're not like the gap between when you have this stuff versus when you don't is massive and yet it just takes a couple hours per day to learn this stuff and I'm going to lay it out to you in a way that is learnable like for example。

 would it surprise you to realize that you could be public speaking as well as anybody on my team。😡。

Within a couple days， does that surprise you， Does that seem weird to think about like these Polish speakers who you seen up speaking for years that are able to do six figures in sales。

7 figures in sales that have crowds regaing them。 Does it surprise you to think that you could be doing the same kind of thing。

You can。 I can show you how to do it。 I'll show you exactly what I've been teaching them for many years。

 Like， is it， do you， does anybody ever pause， Like。

 I always find it funny that people don't pause to ask these elusive， obvious questions。 Like。

 let me give you an example。That's no instructor Luke， well。

 you know what his dating life looks like， right？You know he weighs like 3400 pounds， right？And yet。

 very few people actually talk about that as much as they should。 Like。

 why is nobody talking about a 3 to 400 man。Dating some of the most attractive people in the world。

 Why aren't they talking about this forever， like just。

That's like all they talk about 24 hours a day。 Like you see what I'm saying。

 like when you really pause and think about it。 But what's funny is he'll make it look so normal that you don't really think about it。

I mean， Neil Straus， the author of the book The Game。

 I would even go as far as to say the same thing。 Like Neil Strauss is a 5 foot，5 little bald guy。

With a high pitched voice， also very successful in dating。 why， But you're just like， well， yeah。

 but he's the author of the game。 He's the author。 He's on some different level。

Why aren't we talking about this more Like， why aren't we really digging in and talking about these like freak anomaly situations that completely blow the typical norm。

 but we don't talk about it。 Likewise， why does nobody talk about the fact that every speaker that comes into my organization becomes this crushing public speaker within short order and develop some huge brand。

 Why is nobody talking about this。 Like what's going on behind the scenes that we're able to replicate this kind of result。

 Why is it that I can take just about anybody。 And if they're just around me for a little bit。

 I can teach them the same social skills that I'm using for their dating life or whatever else？

 That's a bit weird when you think about it。 It's a weird thing。 And yet it's so in your face。

 it's it's just so taken for granted that your mind will go into this kind of like celebrity fallacy where you think oh well Luke has a YouTube channel。

 That's why he's 300，400 and has that dating life because he's on the YouTube。😡。

And yet you don't realize Luke is exactly like you。Luke is a human being like you。

 the things he's doing is no different than what you'd be doing。 There's no difference。

So why aren't we talking about this more， right， me as a public speaker。

 Why is it that I'm able to do what I do， Like why is nobody saying over and over， Wait a minute。

 So this guy just did a seven hour improvised event yesterday with nothing prepared and it was probably harder hitting than most people's prepared content。

😡，Why is it that he's able to do that， These are weird questions。 Why aren't they saying。

 how did somebody with light level autism learn to become。One of the best at approaching of all time。

How did that happen， right， But it's like， well， he's on the YouTube。Of course， it's on the YouTube。

Yes， I'm on the YouTube。 Okay， like the only difference with me and you is that I just do like think about your life。

 then just think about it。 You just took a camera and just let it record while you're doing your life。

 And then you just。Press post。 That's it。 That's all that me being on the YouTube means， so。

We need to be looking deeper at some of these elusive。

 obvious questions of why it is that we're able to get these results and realize that anything that I'm doing or that other instructors are doing。

 you can do。 You've got to get past that mental blog that because someone's on the YouTube that you're not going be on that level。

You should be looking at anything that I'm doing， and you should be assuming that you can do this。

 So that's the very first lesson I have to teach you。 what one man can do， Okay。

 what one person could do， another person can do。 That's the first thing that you have to realize what one person could do another person could do。

 Get out of any mental blocks that you have and get out of any limitations that you have。 Okay。

 like we had you up here yesterday。I don't look at you as any different than me。

 My expectations for you are the same as my expectations。😡，For myself。

I don't view it as any different。😡，We're related to each other because we're both human beings。

There's no difference like there's nothing different going on that if we don't just put in the right understandings。

And do the right processes that you can't have the same result。 I have no sympathy on you。

 I don't think I don't think of you as， oh， you're the shy guy who struggles。

 So even if you just make a bit of progress。 that's pretty good。 I don't have that view of you。

 I have no sympathy on you， I I'm not gonna to pander to you。

 I don't think that you need to be treated any differently。

 I think that you can get the exact same results。😡，Hundred% is what I think。 Okay。

 because I've taught people just like yourself and seen them 10 years later。 what they're capable of。

 I know what you're capable of。 Okay， so the big question， though， is。

 you've got to determine if you want it or not。 You've got to determine if you really want this。😡。

Okay， so let me talk about some of the benefits you're going to get out of this。

 and then we're going to launch you into some exercises。😡。

The first thing to understand is I want to show you how to have awareness of your own potential socially。

😡，What that means is that you probably don't understand currently how to be a leader。

 you probably don't fully understand。😡，Probably you don't understand currently how to move people。

 you don't understand how to use your communication to create whether it's attraction， friendship。

 that is you know networking possibilities， getting hired。

 all of these different aspects of social communication that are going to determine the quality of your life you probably don't get these right now and you watch videos of mine and you've said this changed my life。

😡，But guess what， How different is your life really at this point based on watching my videos。

 That's why I've got to get you in here to do the work。

 because yes your life would be somewhat different。

 But a lot of what you're going to get from watching videos is more just psychological relief。

Now here's what I mean by that。When you're struggling in an area。

 I know this because I went through the same process。

 When you're struggling at an area and then you see that somebody who's like you got better in that area。

You realize that it's not your fault or that there's not some kind of like genetic deficiency。

 Like that was what was nice for me。 I was like， oh， so I don't understand dating。

 But then if I did understand it， I'd be fine。 So this doesn't mean I'm defective。

 So that made me feel a lot better。 just knowing I wasn't defective。😡，But nonetheless。

 when I was first learning it， it doesn't mean I could do it。

 So it was nice to know I wasn't defective。 It was a relief to know that there was a path to getting better。

 if I chose to walk it eventually。 That was a nice。😊，Conceptual relief， it made me feel better。😡。

But that being said， I still didn't have the change。Now I could see other people getting the change。

 My mentor was mystery， I could go out with mystery and watch him socializing and watching people flocking to him。

 and that was that weekend that I did with him changed my life forever because when I watched a regular guy like mystery。

 having people flocking to him and begging him for attention I'm like wait a minute so you could do that。

😡，I was determined to get the same result。😡，But nonetheless， I still had to go do it。

 right It's like if you see somebody who lost a lot of weight or got really fit。

 it's nice to know that you have that capacity to lose weighter to get fit。

 but you still need to go through the process in order to get it。

 So what you've seen from me on YouTube and social media platforms up to this point has been really powerful。

 improvised concepts。 These are concepts that I come up with on the spot to entertain and to what's called infoane。

 It's infotainment。 is's basically you could be watching television like a TV show。

 instead you choose to watch my videos， which you're gonna to be probably。

5000 times more educational than a typical TV show and maybe twice as educational as a good TV show。

 You know， something like that， but。You know， depending on the show。 So， you know。

 half it' educational as。Maybe a really great show。 But you know my point。

 So basically what you have is that's called infofotament。 You've now left the world of infotament。

 We're not in the world of infotament anymore。 Okay， I'm very proud of what I put on social media。

 I think it changes lives， I've seen how it changes lives。

 but this is going to a completely different level right now。

 because this is you being committed to actually changing。 If you're here。

 you're committed to really changing。 but we've got to go through the process。 Now to do this。

 we're gonna have to push ourselves to transform。 Now， anytime that you have a transformation。

 the first thing to understand it's going take。Energy is going to take energetic exertion。

 okay whether that's the tuition that you pay to come here， but more importantly。

 the time that you're using to be here and more importantly the energy that you're going to use to be here okay。

 let me give an example， take my public speaking I've worked on it for years。 I can get you to 70。

80% of what I do in a couple days if we work together in my opinion。😡，That's quick。

 but for me to get into the world class level or to be in that conversation as the top speaker。

 that took me doing it again and again and again， and again and again and again。

 and again and again and again， and when you see me yesterday， for example， when I did my free event。

😡，I got out of here at about 330 in the morning or something like that。Okay。

Now I started that event at 7 PM。 I get out at 3，30。Now， this might surprise you guys。

 It's not at my advantage to run an event that late。 Any， for example。

 who's ever done sales from the stage knows you're supposed to run the event about 90 minutes。😡。

Why did I run it that long， Why did I make more money over the course of my career trajectory by running an event from。

 Why do I get more money by running an eight hour event， even though by running an eight hour event。

 you actually do you're proven to get less sales。 It's proven。😡，Okay。

 like my marketing team is ripping their hair out。 So， yeah。

 they're not the only bald ones on the team。 So， so think of it this way。

 why would I make more moneydy overall by running it longer， Can you guess it。

That's for my enjoyment， that's great， what else？Why would I make more flat cash by writing it longer。

 What do you think？Thats can be pretty cool， but believe it or not。😡。

You guys probably think that I sold you yesterday？If I'm。See， my business is doing well。

 so I don't need to sell hard If you guys ever want to watch me clear a room。

Come watching me clear a room okay well because the reason why， by the way， to clear a room。

 you basically just hammer the like if you go to certain very famous self- development events。

 they're going to teach you like five lessons and each of those five lessons is just training you to buy stuff。

😡，That's all they do。 they do cheering， they trade you on the five lessons to buy stuff over and over on repeat。

 and then they they just clear the room out。 They're not teaching deep content at all。

 It's just completely a sales pitch。 the whole thing。

 most of the most expensive selfeve on the market are literally just a pyramid scheme like they sell you to the one thing they sell you to the next thing they sell you the next thing and it's just a pyramid scheme I wouldn't say they're teaching things that are bad actually I think that even what they teach in the pyramid scheme is pretty cool but I teach real content Like I go very。

 very deep on in my content So why is it that I would make more money over the course of my career by doing seven hours of speaking。

 why is it that I make more money being here running an event。

 even though I could produce more revenues being in my home right now。😡。

Baaning it because I'm running the operation， but why is it that I can make more money overall being here。

 what do you think？Long term loyalty， Nope， not even that。

I can make so much more money sitting at home。How much money can I spend can I make sitting in my house。

 Oh my God， because it's scalable， bro， this doesn't scale。😡，So， what are some other reasons？

P into wealth。I think that could work， but why wouldn' I I can scale that from my house。

 I can just create the program and have my instructor team run it。😡，To a very high level。

Because I can train people in that， which is what I'm going to train you on this weekend。 What else。

Take a guess。The feeling that。That's a great feeling， but let's make it about business。

 let's talk money。Yep， you're giving 100%。Great feeling， let's talk about money yep。

Because it's going to relate to you。Where are the house marketing？What's that。

We're up mouth marketinging because we spent seven hours Oh， even with a short event。

 I can still blow your socks off。Yep， don't need to do it for that reason， what is it you？

Don't need to do that， I can still blow your socks off if you think someone comes to a 90 minute event that has a little pitch at the end that they're not going to still be super happy。

 take a guess yep。No， not even I mean， I'll do sales here or there， but not even again。

If I want to clear a room， I wouldn't have taught real content。 Okay， so here's the， okay。

 last two guesses。 youre aim for life。 You won't get bored。Yes。

 long term desire to say and it is big。 That was the first answer that's correct about money。

 but I'll give more yep。I'd say that too， here's the answer。😡。

I do my own events because I believe that I have the capability to be the best speaker in the world。

 and I believe that the only way I can be the best speaker in the world is by speaking。😡。

And I believe that when you're at the top level， you get paid astronomical amounts。

 See even these really high level Internet marketers。They don't compare to Anthony Robins。Right。

Well why is that， what separates Robins from， I don't know。

 say like a Frank Kern or Ryan Dce who or a Dan Kennedy。

 who are wildly superior marketers to Anthony Robbins， in my view。

 why is it that Tony Robbins at a different level？Because when you see Tony。

 you might as well be seeing Jesus alive。Okay， so Jesus reincarnated with 5% marketing tools is better than Frank Kern with 500% marketing tools。

 even though Frank Kern's say is a guy who I think is very inspirational。

 And I think Ryan Dyce inspirational。 All these guys， I think are very inspirational。

 Alex Beckcker's amazing。 you know， a lot of these guys are amazing。 Now， here's why I bring this up。

I'm going to teach you exactly， exactly to the letter。😡，How I speak， how I do social media。

 how I do all the things that I do。But at the end of the day。

 you've got to put it into practice When you guys see me awake until three in the morning。

 when you guys see me teaching something here that doesn't scale， you might think。

 oh he's doing this for business， this isn't business。😡，Okay， this is art。And with that art。

 you can then scale it， see what I'm 50， I can dial back what I'm doing or go hire other people to serve those functions while still having these skills。

 so I'm going show you how to do it， but I'm going to recommend that after this event。

 you think about how you want to apply this and don't hold back。

 make a decision of where you want to use it。😡，The way that I built this was there's probably about 10 understandings that I have to be able to do what I do。

 Now， that sounds like it's that sounds like it's like unreal unrealistically low， doesn't it。

 Doesn't that sound unrealistically low that I could do what I'm doing。

 just understanding about 10 things。Triing。We will do this together。 you will see part of being。

A veteran teacher is that when you're new， you don't know very much。 That is you keep teaching。

 you learn hundreds of things， thousands of things， and you progress。 That's maybe like you're one。

 you know almost nothing。 you're five， you know， way too much right my seminars at your  five would have been encyclopedic like like and then there's this aspect。

 this aspect， this aspect， this aspect， this aspect， this aspect。

 I'd be showing you every little nuance of anything that you'd ever want to know。 I mean。

 I could I'll give examples of it later if you want me to talk about it。

 Like I had one of my first ever things I wrote with something called the 25 points。

 and I would literally give every little like bodily positioning to use and things to not do and so on and so forth。

 and you'd have to remember lists of stuff to do it perfect。 Now you catching me at your eight or9。

 and I'm like here do this little interactive exercise for six minutes。😡。

And you're going to automatically do that 25 points of things。

And if you're not going to have to think about it， it's just going to happen because we did one little tweak。

😡，For six minutes。 Now， that sounds crazy， but that's called being a veteran teacher。 Okay。

 it's usually around year 10 that the genius kicks in。

 Have you ever heard of George Leonard the book called Mastery。

 It's usually at about 10000 hours about a decade deep。 That's when genius starts to kick in。 Okay。

 You start getting into the 20 year range。 You go into that like world class legend range， right。

 I'm not an icon， but I can go down as a legend。 Why can't I be an icon。😡，Not just that。

 I can't be icon because icons in the mainstream right you can't you can't be because an icon is somebody like Mother Teresa where the average person on the street knows who she is not even really knowing the backstory or anything like that。

 That's someone who's iconic。 I can't teach you to be iconic。

 because that requires you to have mainstream exposure but I can teach you to be a living legend。

 I can teach you how to make people cry when they see you on the street。

 pull out money and just aren handing you cash that happens to me every day。

 I can show you how to do that。 Okay I can show you to be a legend within your niche。

 Okay I can show you how to be a living legend within your niche。 I will show it to you。

 And if you make the decision you will do it。 I can show you how to date the people you want to date。

 and I'm talking Skys the limit。 you can date， not the specific person that you want to date because that would be manipulation。

 I can't show you this one person。 how to date them。 That's a manipulation。

 but I can show you how to date the kind of person who you want to date for sure。

 I can show you how to make the kind of money you want to make。

 I can't guarantee you get a specific hire， but。😡，Show you the pathways to make that kind of money。

 and I can show you how to have vicious unfair advantages over almost anybody else。

 and I will not just show you this。 I will hardwire it into you。

 I will get you doing this so that by the time you leave。

 the muscles are beginning to get formed Okay I will show you this。

 But going back to what I said about why I teach all the time。😡，In the long term。

 you have to put it into practice I can show you how to speak within a framework of sales and marketing。

 but if you just go back to speaking in your regular way。

 nothing is going to come of this so you've got to take note of what it is that I'm going to show you and then you have to proceed to put it into practice then if you put into practice over and over and over。

 that is where you'll get to the point where people will freak out okay now by the way。

 the secret sauce of why you can become that living legend has people freak out。😡，在开头啊。

泰勒提出了一个又一个的核心思想，他列举了ISC导师中的一些人，比如卢克，1个300斤的胖子，一个矮个子的型男，这两个都是能够做出一些出乎常人的事情。他们能够很好的去进行社交，并且交到好多女朋友。

并且呢现在依然在传授相关的一些经验，这时候呢我们就要跳出一个叫名人光运的一个东西。人们呢常常会陷入到名人的光环里面，他认为取得成就的人啊，与自己是不同的。而并没有意识到，其实我们每个人都有同样的潜力。

一个人能做到的，另一个人也能做到。正是因为我们都是人，所以我们没有任何的一个区别。别人行，你也行，别人没有比你多长一个脑袋和一个胳膊一条腿，在我们的研讨会群里面，你也可以见证其他蓝图2。

0的学员是如何从一步步，从零到一从无到有成长起来的。思维上的卡点。有些时候呢你想几年是想不通的，有可能你在群里的大佬轻飘飘的一句话呢，你就顿悟了。我们大家可以看一下啊，抖音的一些新进的网红啊。

比如说李子柒，他有没有模仿者，小杨哥，他也没有模仿者。这些网红呢前赴后继，就像那个雨后春笋一般啊，我并不是说让大家去做一个网红，而是说泰勒也一直在说一个人能做到的，另一个人也能做到。

很多人呢在面对他人的非凡的成就的时候呢，常常会感觉到不可思议。甚至认为这是因为对方拥有某种特殊的一种天赋，或者他有着以别人优秀的背景，事实并不是这样子的，真正阻碍我们的，往往是我们自己的心理障碍。

将成功人士视为名人，认为他们之所以能够取得今天的成就，是因为他们跟我们不一样，他们和我们拥有不同的一些特质。但事实上他们和我们一样，都是普通人，他们能做到的，我们也能够做到。一个人能做到的。

另一个人也能做到，这应该成为我们的信念和行动指南。还有一个问题啊，就是我们所说的一个实践的问题啊，你光说不练肯定。会一无所成。就是你们在学他的蓝图解码之前啊，天天嘴上都能说，对吧？

有的时候我会在群里面看到看到看到他去指导别人的聊天，一个比一个厉害，但是啊本质上都没有说透。说来说去，无非就是之前蓝图1。0的东西说什么样有核心自信啊，要突破社会性限制啊，要怎么样怎么样。

这些都是空泛的口号，啊，泰勒也说了啊，尤其是在他的蓝图2。0，反复强调了实践这一点，其实有些同学啊买了太多的课，也去网上翻阅了无数的资料啊，尤其是情感课啊，大同小异，我觉得学知识啊，要从源头学习。

更要去实战。你只有采取了正确的理解和正做正确的事啊，你才能获得成功。这不仅仅是学习表层的知识啊。更重要的是，你要去亲自实践。这样才能去掌握啊这些技巧，那么理解和消化这一部分的工作，我们在蓝图2。

0研讨会里面会对核心的部分，一个深入的。解读。如果你想要更好的传递哎你自己是谁，你想把你自己的生活展示给别人看的时候啊，其中对于我们来说啊，拍视频、拍抖音，这就是最好的传播你的一个方式。

这样虽然听起来挺简单。这一切背后都需要克服很多显而易见的心理障碍，其实我们作为男性很少有人会去把自己的展示面，自己的朋友圈去打造好。是当我们作为一个看客，看视频学习的时候啊，尽管能在心理上得到一些宽慰。

但是只有亲自经历过这个过程之后，你才能真正的取得成果，就像你看很多人通过减肥啊，健身啊，取得了成功，仅仅知道这一点呢，其实你也可以对吧？你心想我也能够通过减肥和健身够获得一个好的身材，但是你想是不够的。

你人要管住嘴，迈开腿，亲力其中，所以说一个人能做到的，另一个人也能做到，而不是表层的一个理解，并不是说我读了葵。花宝典我就能变成天下第一。哪怕你把蓝图解码2。0不备了，依然只是口头上的纸上谈兵啊。

现实世界瞬息万变，充满了各种复杂的情况和突发的事件。如果说你过于依赖理论的话，容易形成思维的定时啊，缺乏灵活的创造力，遇到理论无法解释和知道的问题时呢，你就会无从适从，所以说为什么有些人会中毒。

就是一知半解，光说不练啊，导致自己走火入魔，越陷越深。真正的蜕变和成长是需要付出实际的行动和努力的，光看视频听到理是远远不够的。看视频呢，虽然能够得到心灵的慰藉，但是真正改变还是需要付出行动的。

你学太多都没有用，是没有办法去得成果的。那么成就壁垒呢？就是我们经常为别人的成功去找理由。因为他人高啊，因为他帅啊，因为他有钱啊，总之都有原因。我们会为自己的失败去找借口。🎼自己丑，因为自己穷。

不愿意去实现自己的真正的一个目标，下定决心要获得同样的成果。但无论如何呢，我们还是要必须去实践，这是我们泰勒一直在强调。
