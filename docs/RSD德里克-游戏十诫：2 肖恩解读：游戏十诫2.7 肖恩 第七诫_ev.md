Commanment 7Ôºå thou shalt invite her to join your adventure„ÄÇIn this section„ÄÇ

 we're going to talk about what it means to make your life into an adventure that women would actually want to be a part of„ÄÇ

So many guys that get into this field are naturally cognitive long term thinkers„ÄÇ

 this is great and it causes them to do things that many guys won't do like go to the gym„ÄÇ

 get their finances handledÔºå meditateÔºå etc„ÄÇThis also causes them to ignore the other part of lifestyle„ÄÇ

 which is building a funÔºå Comp life that girls are drawn to„ÄÇ

 So when I was first starting at this stuff„ÄÇüòäÔºåI lived in Los Angeles„ÄÇ

 I moved to Los Angeles and I started going out every single night„ÄÇ

 I got to the point where I could pretty much take home a girl two nights out of three or sometimes three nights out of three„ÄÇ

 And this was greatÔºå but I was running into a problem where I wasn't actually closing them„ÄÇ

Then I got to a point where I was able to close them„ÄÇ

 but I wasn't able to close the nines and tens and then I got to the point where I was able to close the nines and tens„ÄÇ

 but I wasn't able to keep them And so I really started thinking about okay the nines and tens of Los Angeles what type of guys are they actually dating and I started making note of this and it very much surprised me because at that part of my life I was working extremely hard in every area I was working out I was getting my finances handled my career handled I was working basically all day long and in my mind I was like I'm sleeping with these girls„ÄÇ

 I'm actually taking them home but then once they get to know me they're not that compelled„ÄÇ

 but I don't understand I'm doing everything that a guy should I'm handling everything so what else could they possibly be What I realized is that it wasn't because I wasn't successful if anything it was because I was too successfocused and it wasn't relatable I remember one of my long-term girlfriends actually told me that seeing me go about my day was hard to watch because I was pushing myself so„ÄÇ

I was running aroundÔºå you knowÔºå I go straight from the gym„ÄÇ

 go back to reading some success book and then go back to working on some project and basically„ÄÇ

 you know only had time like 10 minutes of time with her a day and she was just watching me like run around the apartment doing all this crazy shit„ÄÇ

You have to understand that while fun is the currency of the nightclub„ÄÇ

 long termm fun is what makes a girl want to stay„ÄÇ Being a guy whose life is defined solely by a series of selfhel projects creates a very dry and dull experience for any girl that is thinking about joining your life„ÄÇ

 She will admire you for that long term thinking but will not be sufficiently emotionally compelled to join that life and success with women is all about emotion„ÄÇ

 Under that just by the nature of being the type of guy to listen to this product„ÄÇ

 You probably think differently than most other people„ÄÇ

 And most people probably do not think the same way you do„ÄÇ I'll say that again„ÄÇ

 the average person is not thinking the same way you do„ÄÇ

 Does that mean you don't have the same psychological tendency as the rest of our species has„ÄÇ No„ÄÇ

 but it means that by being the type of person who is thinking long term at all„ÄÇ

 you are already engaging in thought patterns that most people can't relate to„ÄÇ

 The average person is looking to have as much fun status„ÄÇ

 emotion and pleasure in the short termm as possible„ÄÇ

They may admire the long term thinkers and wish they were like that„ÄÇ

 They relate late more to the guy living a life of short term fun„ÄÇ So to illustrate this point„ÄÇ

 let's talk for a minute about agriculture and two different popular crops„ÄÇ One crop„ÄÇ

 the brassica allerasiaÔºå which had origins in Europe„ÄÇ

 became somewhat popular because it was one of the most healthy foods for you on the planet„ÄÇ

 Another cropÔºåryrazyillococa also became a very popular crop„ÄÇ

 One of these crops sells millions of dollars a year in net yield„ÄÇ

 The other crop sells hundreds of billions dollars a year„ÄÇ So what is the first cropÔºå Well„ÄÇ

 the first crop that's very good for you is kale„ÄÇ The second crop is cocaÔºå Aka A cocaine„ÄÇ Now„ÄÇ

 everyone one knows that kale is muchÔºå much better for you than cocaine„ÄÇ

 So why has the cocoa plant sold hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of billions of dollars in the last decade„ÄÇ

 WellÔºå because while people may„ÄÇalkAbout how they like to eat kale„ÄÇ They actually do cocaine„ÄÇ

 People will talk ad nauseum about all their goalsÔºå all the selfhelp projects that they have„ÄÇ

 But when you actually look at what they're doingÔºå when you look at the dollars and what they're being spent on„ÄÇ

 you see that people are very concerned with short term emotions„ÄÇ

 and not at all concerned with long term progress„ÄÇ Think about this another way„ÄÇ

 Who would you rather beÔºå which life would you rather liveÔºå Bill Gatess life or M Jagger's life„ÄÇ

 What about with girlsÔºå do you think they're more attracted to Bill Gates or M Jagger„ÄÇ Obviously„ÄÇ

 Mc Jaggers got more girls than anyone can countÔºå Bill Gates is still stuck with Melinda making nerdy decisions about malaria„ÄÇ

 One of them is sexy and the other one is someone they admire but isn't exactly emotionally compelling„ÄÇ

 So what really illustrate this point to me was a couple years ago„ÄÇ

 I made a bumble account with a hot girl„ÄÇ not to like catfish guys„ÄÇ

 but just because I want to see what type of guys are„ÄÇ

The most matches And the way that Bumble's algorithm works is that it will show you the hottest people in your city or the most swiped people in your city first„ÄÇ

 So with BumbleÔºå I could seeÔºå okayÔºå what guys in each given city or actually getting the most swipes„ÄÇ

 What I found was pretty revealing„ÄÇ The guys that were getting the most swipes in each city had a couple things in common„ÄÇ

 Number oneÔºå they were all living an extremely fun lifestyle„ÄÇ Number two„ÄÇ

 they all had a certain archetypeÔºå they were the sports guy or they were the pilot„ÄÇ

 or they were the weed guy„ÄÇ It didn't really matter what the archetype was„ÄÇ

 but that they just had an archetype and that was suggestive of a life congruent to their personality„ÄÇ

 ThirdÔºå there is some sort of adventure that they could take these girls on„ÄÇ

 The pilot he's able to fly these girls all around the world„ÄÇ

 The weed dealer is able to let them have that chilled out experience„ÄÇ

 because they had a specific archetype and because they were having fun with that archetype„ÄÇ

 There's a naturally compelling story that became a part of their profiles„ÄÇüòä„ÄÇ

I also noticed this for myself in my time in Los Angeles„ÄÇ

 the type of guys that9s and tens were dating long term had a unique niche in archetype„ÄÇ

 a tribe around that archetypeÔºå and a fun and unique adventure that was congruent with that niche and archetype„ÄÇ

So I'm going to get into why that's important and how to build that„ÄÇ But first„ÄÇ

 I want you to understand something about this adventure stuff„ÄÇ Pickup is for lead generation„ÄÇ

 What that means is it is to bring in new girls into your life„ÄÇ

 so that you aren't relying on your social circle and you aren't taxing the other parts of your life by trying to pick up girls in those areas„ÄÇ

 HoweverÔºå once you already have that girl„ÄÇ Once you've already slept with her or made her into someone that you're seeing every once in a while„ÄÇ

 you want to be able to bring that girl into a lifestyle and the nines and tens„ÄÇ

 the types of girls that you reallyÔºå really want to date„ÄÇ

 they usually tend to end up with guys that have some sort of exciting lifestyle„ÄÇ

 You have to think that a girl that can get almost anyone else in the city„ÄÇ Well„ÄÇ

 she may sleep with a guy that's reallyÔºå really emotionally compelling that night„ÄÇ However„ÄÇ

 she's going to stay with a guy that is emotionally compelling in the long term„ÄÇ

 someone that has other people in her lifeÔºå someone that's going on adventure„ÄÇ

 someone that's having fun situations doing„ÄÇthings like skydiving„ÄÇ

 diving with the dolphins or whatever she wants to be able to have that experience in the long term she wants you to be successful because a successful guy is going to have the resources to do those things and because he's going to have a certainty that let's say a wee dealer doesn't however„ÄÇ

 she also wants to have fun and that's a part of her psychology and if you ignore it„ÄÇ

 she's going to naturally gravitate towards guys that will fulfill that for her„ÄÇ

So I'm going to get into the specifics of how to build each of theseÔºå the archetype„ÄÇ

 the tribe around that archetype and then the fun unique adventure that is congruent with that archetype„ÄÇ

 then I'm going to talk a bit about the practicalities of what this means in the club„ÄÇ

 a bit about social circle game and then using social media„ÄÇ

So why was I finding that each guy that was actually dating these nines and1s had this archetype and that niche about them Well you have to think about brand awareness„ÄÇ

 People tend to buy coca-cola more than they buy R Ccola people tend to go to McDonald's rather than the burger joint down the street even if it takes the same amount of time people think in heuristics what that means is you make broad generalizations about something so that you can save time and energy People don't have time to think through every little contingency they run into so they tend to think in brands If someone can portray a specific brand then that saves them the energy and they don't have to think about is this even worth my time to try it people also are more likely to try something that they already know the quality of think of the devil you know is better than the devil you don't Even if the thing that they're trying isn't all that enjoyable Well„ÄÇ

 it's just easier than going around and trying the quality of all these different random off brand that you have no idea if they're any good you also know that if someone has a brand or if they have a little„ÄÇ

nicheÔºå if they have an archetypeÔºå then they are probably related to the other people in that archetype and you will be able to get the advantages of those people as well because he's probably a part of that group„ÄÇ

 Think about why does a muscular guy attract women Now part of that is just biology but I think the real part of it is that girls associate muscular guys with a cultural zeitgeist around popularity in every movie the muscular guy is popular„ÄÇ

 So he has that brand awareness of already being related to the popular group or what the popular group most likely looks like And so she's able to use that brand awareness to make a decision very quickly that okay this guy's most likely a part of that brand„ÄÇ

 I know what that brand is and that brand is quality or at least I know the quality of that brand„ÄÇ

 So choosing your niche and choosing your archetype It doesn't really matter which one you pick as long as it's congruent and compelling So if you are a natural sports guy if that's something you're really passionate about Well you want to start acting in ways that are very congruent„ÄÇ

That you want to start building a tribe around that„ÄÇ You want to start having adventures around that„ÄÇ

 You want to start dressing that way so that you have a bit of that brand awareness„ÄÇ Well„ÄÇ

 Derek has that archetype of a business guy„ÄÇ his personality is very congruent with that„ÄÇ

 His adventure is very congruent with that„ÄÇ when you talk to him you know that he's a business guy„ÄÇ

 If you're a nerd be a nerd to the fucking hilt dress wellÔºå but dress nerdy„ÄÇ

 The guy that's wearing loose clothing that he bought at Kmart„ÄÇ

 even if he's tall and muscular will probably lose out to the nerd guy who has these designer shirts with video game shit on it„ÄÇ

 know he's got the glassesÔºå he's looking sharpÔºå he's really fucking embraced his nerd self„ÄÇ

 We had a boot camp student recently who is kind of an artist guy and all he wanted to do was find a girl to paint and drink tea with„ÄÇ

 and that's great„ÄÇ HoweverÔºå he needs to start really living that archetype if he's going to find that girl„ÄÇ

 The second part of this is that there should be a selling point of fun and adventure to each archetype„ÄÇ

 So if you're a nerd„ÄÇAnd you want to track nerd girls wellÔºå you should be the fun nerd„ÄÇ

 the guy that gets to go to the most fun nerdy shit if you're a sports guy„ÄÇ

 you want to convey yourself not necessarily as the guy up in the nose bleeds with his creepy uncle you want to convey yourself as the guy that's hanging out in the locker room with the actual players you want to emphasize the fun parts of these archetypes and really play these archetypes to the absolute hilt avoid niches that are too strict or too close to social conditioning an example would be the social justice warrior niche Well you might become the absolute king of that niche but it's very judgmental and people aren't really hooking up a lot in that niche so you're gonna find a pretty fucking hard to attract girls if you just played yourself up as this ultimate feminist guy Another thing would be the religious niche you could become this super super compelling churchgoer but that type of crowd is really into the no sex before marriage and so it's not really conducive to our goals So now that you've kind of decided„ÄÇ

 okay who I am what I'm interested in and then what kind of archetype„ÄÇI want to emphasize„ÄÇ

 think a bit about aesthetics So there used to be this concept called peacocking in this community and it got made fun of a lot because people would do it in an extremely lame way„ÄÇ

 This started when a magician who happened to be kind of good at the stuff would go out and he would dress up like a magician and he would dress that way to an extreme which was great for him he had a top hat he had all sorts of fuzzy boas and weird clothing on and made him look like a very fun„ÄÇ

 compelling magician„ÄÇ HoweverÔºå other people started wearing the same shit„ÄÇ

 even though they weren't magicians„ÄÇ they would wear the fuzzy top hat they would wear the weird leather pants„ÄÇ

 and because it had nothing to do with their personality„ÄÇ

 it didn't even fit well and those pieces didn't even match with the other parts of their clothing just came off as extremely weird and this stuff got a reputation for being ridiculous when you think about aesthetics„ÄÇ

 you have to make sure that this is actually congruent with the archetype that you are style really is it'„ÄÇ

Congruence with the tribe you're in the pieces all match each other and the clothes well fitting It's basically those three things„ÄÇ

 If you look at fashion shows„ÄÇ that's basically it„ÄÇ it's a bunch of random stuff„ÄÇ

 no one really knows why it's popular but it's congruent well fittingtting and all the pieces match each other Another thing about aesthetics make sure your house and personal space actually matches this archetype as well I have a friend who's a bit of a hippie guy he goes to a lot of rays and stuff he likes to do ayahuasca a lot and if you go into his house it's all sorts of tie dye things and weird light show things and crystals and stuff like that this guy actually gets laid all the time with the hottest girls in a city but he's able to do that because he dresses the part because his apartment is actually congruent with his personality actually is set up in a nice way that shows very„ÄÇ

 very clearly what type of guy is So you have to think about does my clothing match my niche does my apartment match my niche and then you have to start thinking about okay is this done in a way that is sharp and special„ÄÇ

Even for that niche„ÄÇ So if you're say a hipsterÔºå but you look exactly like every other hipster that's not gonna to be compelling„ÄÇ

 HoweverÔºå if you're like the coolest hipster in that group with the best fashion done in a slightly unique way„ÄÇ

 a unique way that only you do„ÄÇ It's gonna look even better„ÄÇ Derek is a business guy„ÄÇ However„ÄÇ

 he's able to stand out in that world because he has this like long flowing hair„ÄÇ

 he's got these like interesting t-shirts and he blazers„ÄÇ And so in that environment„ÄÇ

 he's able to come off as a business guy„ÄÇ but he's just slightly different and slightly more stylish than the other business guys„ÄÇ

 So is my nicheÔºå wellÔºå I'm somewhere between a nerd and a hipsterÔºå as you can probably tell„ÄÇ

 I'm very cognitive„ÄÇ And so a lot of my stuffÔºå it's very hipory actually have a mustache right now and a logogo T„ÄÇ

 I kind of look like Satan„ÄÇ and I go to a lot of hipory nerdy events or music festival stuff like that„ÄÇ

 And because I look kind of like a hipster kind of like the guy that would be at a music festival„ÄÇ

 I'm just a little bit more fashionable and both hitting brand awareness and being able to stand out at the same time„ÄÇ

üòäÔºåSo another little detail of this is you have to be a leader of that niche or archetype„ÄÇ

 No one wants to fuck the junior executive„ÄÇ No one wants to fuck the kicker on the football team„ÄÇ

 DrekÔºå he's a businessmanÔºå but his sense of style suggests he's either entrepreneur„ÄÇ

 drug dealer or entertainer„ÄÇ He's able to come off as someone that's so successful that he can afford to wear that clothing„ÄÇ

 My hippie friend that I talked aboutÔºå the guy that goes to all these raves and electronic music festivals„ÄÇ

 He's coming off as a guy that knows everything about that little niche„ÄÇ

 He's coming off as an authorityÔºå Someone that is a leader in that niche„ÄÇ

 not just some random dude that's following the other hippies„ÄÇNext„ÄÇ

 you have to make sure that your hobbies and skills are congruent with that niche„ÄÇ

 You're the hippie guy„ÄÇ Maybe learn a little bit about meditation„ÄÇ If you're the entrepreneur„ÄÇ

 maybe start learning a little bit about economics„ÄÇ If your're cowboyÔºå go ride horses„ÄÇ The point is„ÄÇ

 you want your entire life to be kind of presenting this story„ÄÇ

 a congruent and easy to understand story about who you are is also special and compelling„ÄÇ

 You should have a deep inside knowledge of that niche„ÄÇ

 and an ability to talk about it as if it's the most exciting thing in the world„ÄÇ

 Think about gray's anatomy„ÄÇ Do you really want to go study anatomy and microbiology for eight years„ÄÇ

 FÔºå noÔºå HoweverÔºå it's really interesting to hear all of these characters talking about it as if it's the most exciting thing in the world„ÄÇ

 And they have this inside knowledge of it that you don't So you get sucked into their world„ÄÇ

 Be the type of person that can talk about this stuff as if it's the best niche in the world„ÄÇ

 RememberÔºå I talked about the sons of anarchy„ÄÇ stupidup little motorcycle club„ÄÇ

 but they think they're the coolest guys in the world„ÄÇ So know a lot„ÄÇ

About this niche and then also be able to act as if this niche is the niche„ÄÇ

 It's the best lifestyle for anyone to be living Next'm going to talk about building a tribe around that archetype„ÄÇ

 So why is this important It conveys to the girls that you have alliances which conveys abundance access to resources someone that would help you in a fight all great things it conveys that you are accepted for your weirdness So if you're the lone nerd Well„ÄÇ

 that's not a very good situationÔºå if you're the king of all the cool nerds and everyone is offering social proof as to why that nerdiness is cool„ÄÇ

 much more compelling LastlyÔºå by seeing these alliances„ÄÇ

 she knows that she will be protected survival for her and survival for her kids„ÄÇ

 Ho girls want to feel like she's gaining friends and gaining alliances just by being with you and that she would lose alliances by leaving you think about why girls want to be with the popular guy It's because he's offering so many other people it's access to everyone else in the school you can see this in society as well100„ÄÇ

Years agoÔºå someone would marry someone almost based on how big their family was„ÄÇ

 They were able to gain those social alliances and then get all of the advantages of being a part of that tribe as's a big part of a marriage back in the day„ÄÇ

 So how do you actually build that tribe There's two ways one is by building a social circle from scratch and the other is by joining a social circle that's already set up obviously joining the one from scratch is much„ÄÇ

 much easier„ÄÇ So I'm going to break this down in detail in terms of how you should act and how you should attract people into your life Well it's already the stuff that we talked about subcommunications„ÄÇ

 having that sense of certaintyÔºå honesty humor all of that stuff works with friends as well„ÄÇ

 and people naturally gravitate towards that type of person„ÄÇ

 So when we talk about building a tribe or building a social circle you have to understand that people mostly become friends with other people through shared experiences„ÄÇ

 This is why going to a movie where you're not looking at each other and not talking to each other„ÄÇ

 not working on anything is a terrible dateÔºå but let's say going to acade„ÄÇ

is a great day because you're actually playing games together you're having real experiences that you guys are experiencing for the first time together so when you're thinking about making new friends„ÄÇ

 new alliancesÔºå you want to focus on having those shared experiences either with one person or if you're doing a group activity make sure that it's a compelling group activity don't just go to a bar with people go to an escape room go go carting do something new or something where you have to work together because that build connection much much quicker than either staring at a screen or just talking to someone in a normal environment like a bar So let's get in the specifics of actually joining that social circle or building the social circle building that tribe that is congruent with that archetype let's say that you're in a brand new city and you need to find people Most people find each other naturally through structured shared experiences so this could be something like hobbies work where you're not just hold approaching something it's something where you're both naturally there anyways and you're both having„ÄÇ

Shared experience so a lot of people meet their friends at work because they're having that shared experience of working on a project together„ÄÇ

 a lot of people meet their friends through hobbies„ÄÇ

 something like jujitsu or Crossfit because they're having that shared experience together it's a structured shared experience because someone has already set up that environment there's already a specific activity that everyone's supposed to be focusing on and makes it much much easier to then have those shared experiences talk to each other without the awkwardness of why are we talking to each other so you might meet someone from work you might meet someone from your hobby you might meet someone from this area of your life maybe you're at summit and so they're in that structured shared experience you can start naturally talking to people and attracting people in a compelling way and cutting out some of the awkwardness of two people wondering if they have anything in common at all so you meet those people you get in good with them you express your compelling personality and then you can start inviting them to what are called general events so these could be hobby related activities these could be going to a bar It's something that is„ÄÇ

L pressure that you can take one person to that's easy to invite maybe a oneoff person or to invite maybe two people to then you can do that again with other people then you can start building maybe three alliances in that city maybe four friends in that city five friends in that city each of them maybe you go to a bar every once in a while you go do this activity thing you do yoga or whatever every once in a while and you have those activities where you're able to talk to them one on one and it's not awkward then once you have a group of those people you can start going to general events together so you all go to the bar together once again low pressure then you go to maybe a concert together Also low pressure a place where two people that don't know each other can get to know each other etc then once you have maybe like six people that all know each other you can start holding where called specific events so this could be a party at your house this could be all of you going on a fun run this could be all of you going on a yacht trip together because you're now a group you built those alliances separately at first„ÄÇ

Then combine them in a low- pressure environment over time and then start doing those specific events„ÄÇ

 You now basically have a social circle„ÄÇ This might sound nerdy a nerdy way to think about friendships„ÄÇ

 but you have to realize this is how it actually happens in the real worldÔºå think about this„ÄÇ

 So if someone moves to a new city„ÄÇ they get a job and they meet someone at work that they really„ÄÇ

 really get along with or they meet someone at their jujitsu class that they really„ÄÇ

 really get along with and they start hang out with that person„ÄÇ

 They meet another person at their gym and they really get along with that guy They meet another person at their meditation group and they really get along with that guy and they're getting drinks with all these people individually and then eventually they decide„ÄÇ

 oh wellÔºå you know I don't have time that night„ÄÇ So why don't I just get drinks with both of them at the same time„ÄÇ

 And then those three are getting to know each other and then eventually you start doing general events where four people are there together Then maybe you go to a concert and then you're inviting two or three friends and then all these people are getting to know each other they're exchanging numbers and they start naturally doing things together Then they start doing more specific things like having a birthday party holding some sort of charity event„ÄÇ

 They start doing these specific events„ÄÇThey're actually unique to the group and about the group itself„ÄÇ

 not about just several individuals hanging out„ÄÇ So if you're in that new city„ÄÇ

 you can really speed up this process by knowing how this happens„ÄÇ go outÔºå make those alliances„ÄÇ

 start having those general events„ÄÇ and then within a monthÔºå start having those specific events„ÄÇ

 start inviting more people to those events„ÄÇ Eventually„ÄÇ

 you will have what's called a self-sustaining system„ÄÇ

 where other people are inviting people to those events„ÄÇ

 and then those people are inviting people to events„ÄÇ and you're meeting all these people„ÄÇ

 and then you meet up with another social circle„ÄÇ you go to their events through one of your friends and then you're getting people from that social circle„ÄÇ

 EventuallyÔºå you have such a big social circle that people are just coming into the group naturally„ÄÇ

 If you're doing this in your specific niche„ÄÇ Then all of those people are interested in the things that you're interested in„ÄÇ

 and then you can bring a girl to those parties„ÄÇ you can bring a girl to those concerts„ÄÇ

 you can start bringing girls to the events that other people are inviting you to„ÄÇ

 and the girl can see that you actually have life„ÄÇ It's congruent„ÄÇ

 you have that tribe is based around your niche„ÄÇAnd she can join that party„ÄÇ

 She can have those shortterm emotions and be with a guy who is doing things every night that are fun„ÄÇ

 I'm going to touch briefly on joining another social circle muchÔºå much easier„ÄÇ

 It's kind of like we just talked about using those things that we discussed in this program on how to be compelling and how to attract people„ÄÇ

 HoweverÔºå if you're going into another person social circle„ÄÇ

 you have to realize that with each party with each eventÔºå the entire goal is to get invited back„ÄÇ

 You are not in charge of that event„ÄÇ So at firstÔºå you are going to have to socialize a lot more„ÄÇ

 and make sure that you are not pissing off anyone in the group„ÄÇ

 Once you've got to invite back three or four times then you're just a part of that„ÄÇ

 you can do the exact same thingÔºå start bringing in new leadsÔºå or bringing in new people„ÄÇ

 other people start bringing in new people and naturally grows from there„ÄÇ

 so now that you have that social circle„ÄÇ We're going to talk a bit about building your adventure„ÄÇ

 So you have the archetype„ÄÇ you built a social circle around that archetype„ÄÇ

 and now we're going build the adventure around that archetype„ÄÇ A lot of these girls„ÄÇ

 these nines and tens that I met„ÄÇüòäÔºåLos AngelesÔºå their boyfriends would be a lot cooler than they were„ÄÇ

 Their boyfriends would be having all these different experiences„ÄÇ

 And the thing is a lot of times the girls wouldn't even go on the actual experience„ÄÇ

 but they would be sort of living life through proxy through their boyfriend„ÄÇ

 So their boyfriend would be doing all this cool stuff and just by the virtue of him living that lifestyle„ÄÇ

 she got to feel as if she was living that lifestyle„ÄÇ

 I know a lot of girls where they have boyfriends that play sports and they have no real interest in sports„ÄÇ

 but just the fact that their husband or friends is doing this exciting thing allows her to feel like she's doing that exciting thing„ÄÇ

 it also allows her to come along with you„ÄÇ but really just building that adventure giving a compelling image that includes many different activities„ÄÇ

 many different things that you're able to do allows the girl to feel as if she is living that life as well„ÄÇ

 So let's talk a bit about what that adventure actually means and what you should build for yourself„ÄÇ

 And by the wayÔºå building this adventureÔºå you're not really doing this for the girls anymore This is very successful at getting a„ÄÇ

or intend to be with you long term„ÄÇ but if that's the only reason you're doing it„ÄÇ

 then it's not really worth it„ÄÇ you want to build this so that your life is fun so that you can have the enjoyment from these activities„ÄÇ

 Obviously the most important activity to start adding to your life to build this sort of archetype to build this niche is the niche activity if you're a nerd maybe going to anime conventions if you're an entrepreneur maybe going to Ted talks if you're a meditator maybe going to meditation retreats Next part travel you want to build a life where you're traveling at least a little bit once again„ÄÇ

 this is not for the fucking girl at this pointÔºå this is just about rounding out your life and making a life that's fucking awesome I tend to do a lot of trips I tend to do maybe 30 weekend trips a year where I'm going to all sorts of cities„ÄÇ

 cities I've never been to before like maybe some small city in the south and then cities that I love like New York Los Angeles Las Vegas Another part of building your adventure these fun oneoff adventures like skydiving go carting going through the jungle just anything„ÄÇ

That is unique and that is kind of a once in a lifetime opportunity or something that you would only do maybe once a year„ÄÇ

 Co hobbiesÔºå things that you reallyÔºå really enjoy doing on a consistent basis„ÄÇ

 like I talked about martial arts or sports or meditation or doing drugs nightlife„ÄÇ

 you want to have at least a little bit of nightlife in your overall life„ÄÇ

 why because if a9 or 10 is joining your life„ÄÇ It gets's really fucking boring if you guys never ever go out So go out to clubs go out to bars social circle stuff„ÄÇ

 costume partiesÔºå how a wean partiesÔºå birthdaysÔºå weddings„ÄÇ

 etc that very much shows that you are part of a group and that that group has accepted you next category is what I call grand events„ÄÇ

 music festivalsÔºå New Year's going on some long trip into the jungle„ÄÇ

 These are things that take a couple days they're expensive however„ÄÇ

 they kind of round out your year and make these very memorable experiences„ÄÇ

 We always go to the best party for New Years and it's a couple day partyÔºå it's awesome what'„ÄÇ

One of our favorite events all year High status events„ÄÇ

 This is stuff like charity things where it cost 100 to get in or going to a maxim party„ÄÇ

 going to a playboy partyÔºå going to an event where everyone's an entrepreneur etc„ÄÇ

 kind of shows that high status part of your life giving back events„ÄÇ

 This would be something like volunteering going to a normal charity dinner stuff like that„ÄÇ

 Why should you be concerned with all these different parts of your life„ÄÇ number one„ÄÇ

 this is bringing in new people to your social circle„ÄÇ N two„ÄÇ

 when you start going to events from all these different categories„ÄÇ

 It creates a picture that you are having more fun than anyone else in the city„ÄÇ

 and that there is nothing that your life is missing„ÄÇ

 That's why I suggest doing a combination of all of these different categories„ÄÇ

 It also allows you to show her that you are exactly the same person in every different context„ÄÇ

 One thing that I think Derek does very well is that he's able to keep his frame he speaks the same way„ÄÇ

 he acts the same way brought a variety of context we've been all over the world together and he basically is the same guy in every different„ÄÇ

Every different type of event and with every type of person„ÄÇ Guess what„ÄÇ

 you can meet girls at these events as well„ÄÇ if you're going to these places with your friends„ÄÇ

 bringing your tribeÔºå bringing your tribe into these different events„ÄÇ they're great„ÄÇ

 great places to meet girls„ÄÇ And they're often very great places to meet high quality girls„ÄÇ

 You can definitely meet a high quality girl at a nightclub or a bar„ÄÇ However„ÄÇ

 they tend to be more concentrated inÔºå let's say a Ted talk or a party that your friend is throwing where all the girls have similar interests that you do„ÄÇ

 If you are bringing your tribe to these events„ÄÇ It becomes extremely extremely easy to meet girls at them„ÄÇ

 I remember I was at a concert with one of my buddies„ÄÇ And when are having so much fun„ÄÇ

 We are so in our own world that girls actually start approaching us„ÄÇ when you're at these places„ÄÇ

 you have an immediate commonality with the girls there„ÄÇ

 If you're able to act more carefree than the other people there and more compelling„ÄÇ

 Then the girls will naturally just gravitate towards you in a bar„ÄÇ

 you have to approach girls that you don't know yet„ÄÇ But in these places„ÄÇüòä„ÄÇ

is a lot of times girls will either approach you or they will stand near you„ÄÇ

 which is kind of the girl version of an approach that's what it means when a girl just stands nearby you for no reason„ÄÇ

So now that you have that archetypeÔºå everything in your life is congruent to that archetype„ÄÇ

 you have the tribe that is surrounded by that archetype or that niche and you now have your life rounded out so that if you do sleep with that9 or 10 you have an amazing„ÄÇ

 amazing life and an amazing adventure to bring her along in Now we're gonna talk a bit about social circle game Let's say you build the social circle and other guys start bringing in girls to the social circle that's what happens when you have a group of maybe 15 guys and 15 other girls„ÄÇ

 everyone is constantly bringing in new people and so with each new event one of those people is going to bring a girl that's quite attractive and she probably has something in common with you because you built your social circle around that niche To me social circle is exactly the same as regular game with a few caveats„ÄÇ

 The main theme of these caveats is more longterm thinking and not poisoning the well that means not doing something that would fuck up the social circle in the long term The whole point of having a social circle besides the obvious reasons of you just one„ÄÇ

Have cool friends is for them to be bringing in new leads„ÄÇ

 And for you to have a group that you can bring new leads in„ÄÇ And if that gets fucked up„ÄÇ

 then your male and female friends are gonna stop bringing leads into those parties for you to meet and you're no longer going to be able to bring your own girls to those parties so they can see your lifestyle„ÄÇ

 So number one don't fuck girls that are going to be around consistently„ÄÇ

 why let's say that your friends starts bringing around a girl and you can tell that they're good friends and she's gonna to start coming to pretty much every party that you throw„ÄÇ

 instead of trying to hit on this girl that you're gonna have to see pretty much every weekend or every other weekend„ÄÇ

 why not just be friends her And then she's going to start bringing all of her friends„ÄÇ

 all the girls that she meets to these parties as well„ÄÇ

 she can say these guys are all these parties are fucking amazing and then she's gonna start bringing in those new girls„ÄÇ

 those other girls you might not necessarily see every weekend„ÄÇ

 And so those girls you can have one night stands with or date them for a while without fear that if for some reason it went wrong„ÄÇ

 it's gonna fuck up your whole social circle or it's gonna„ÄÇüò°ÔºåMake it awkward for everyone„ÄÇ Next„ÄÇ

 don't fuck girls that will piss off a core member„ÄÇ

 If your core group is 10 guys and 10 girls and your buddy brings in a girl that for some reason has a crush on„ÄÇ

 And let's say your budd'ies are reallyÔºå really awesome guys killing it in other areas„ÄÇ

 but just not very good with girls„ÄÇ He brings in that girl that he has a crush on„ÄÇ Well„ÄÇ

 if you sleep with that girl„ÄÇ You're going end up pissing him off„ÄÇ It will cause all sorts of strife„ÄÇ

 I've actually seen this break a social circle in half„ÄÇ

 It just causes this fucking problems that you don't want to be pissing off the core members„ÄÇ

 they're going be inviting you to those cool things and holding those parties and bringing other girls„ÄÇ

üò°ÔºåThis next one's very key for social circle game„ÄÇ You don't necessarily have to be the leader of the social circle„ÄÇ

 but you should be at least one of the leaders„ÄÇ What does this mean„ÄÇ

 It means other people defer to you„ÄÇ You are at least holding some of the events„ÄÇ

 some of the parties and a lot of those people are there because you introduce them to everyone else„ÄÇ

 Don't get too paranoid about thisÔºå don't be the weird guy who's always trying to see if he's the most alpha„ÄÇ

 There could be three or four leaders to that group„ÄÇ However„ÄÇ

 if the girl comes in and she can see that you're just sort of an outsider in that group„ÄÇ

 as opposed to the leader of that groupÔºå you're the ones holding the party„ÄÇ

 you're part of the guys that are making the events going to these fun things planning everything for everyone else„ÄÇ

 It's muchÔºå much easier to get that girl„ÄÇ LastlyÔºå you don't always want to be the guy that hits on every new girl that someone brings around„ÄÇ

 But you still want to get those girls„ÄÇ So how do you get around this„ÄÇ This is a little bit subtle„ÄÇ

 Let's say that you're at a party„ÄÇ You want to be the guy having the most fun at that party„ÄÇ

 having that extreme expression of your personality„ÄÇ

And paying attention more to your friends than you are to the girl„ÄÇ

 you don't necessarily want to approach her right away„ÄÇ

 Then when she sees that you and the people you are talking to are having the most fun that you're the one expressing your personality the most that you're the one that seems the most comfortable in that environment„ÄÇ

 HonestlyÔºå the girls will naturally just start gravitating towards you and joining your conversations„ÄÇ

 They want to join your fun„ÄÇ You don't even have to approach„ÄÇ And at that point„ÄÇ

 you want to be more interested in the fun you're already having than you are in them being slightly dismissive„ÄÇ

 even kind of making fun of her for being the new girl and just being very„ÄÇ

 very focused on what you're already doing„ÄÇ because it's your party within your party„ÄÇ

 The effect of this is that the girl will just naturally start hitting on you„ÄÇ

 And so what it will seem like to everyone else in the group and everyone else in the social circle is that every new girl that comes around„ÄÇ

 just automatically start hittinging on you„ÄÇ So now you're no longer that creepy dude that just hits on every new girl that everyone brings around„ÄÇ

 You're that guy that every new girl that comes around seems to be attracted to„ÄÇ and that boost your„ÄÇ

You immensely if it's logistically viableÔºå you can close there„ÄÇ

 let's say it's a party and there's all sorts of bedrooms there„ÄÇ If not„ÄÇ

 don't necessarily try for the hard clothes„ÄÇ I would say get the number„ÄÇ

 This is actually one of the only situations in which I would get a number„ÄÇ

 I think numbers from the bar fucking useless You don't necessarily want to be hard closing a girl from the social circle either let it happen naturally still lead but let it happen naturally or just number closer„ÄÇ

 get on a date later or then invite it to the second party and then it will be much easier„ÄÇ

 So what is the practicality of having this archetype having that adventure when you're actually in a nightclub and then you approaching girls that don't know you number one„ÄÇ

 girls gravitate towards guys that have that archetype and remember it doesn't matter what archetype that is as long as you have that congruent archetype There is that old saying that girls tend to date guys either from a tribe they are already a part of or a tribe that they want to visit So you have that brand awareness within that club„ÄÇ

 How does building the tribe help your wingmanÔºå which I'm going to talk about in another commandment How does the adventure help Well this help„ÄÇ

In two ways„ÄÇ number oneÔºå it naturally gets expressed through oversharing through your conversations„ÄÇ

 the girl' is always going to be getting a sample size of what your life is like outside of the club and as I said„ÄÇ

 when I talked about oversharingÔºå this isn't something that you like throw in their face It's just that you are talking so much about your life that they will see that oh you've had all these different experiences and that she were to join you she would be having these experiences as well„ÄÇ

 This building your own adventure concept is also very important in a real way and that when you're in the club with a girl it's a lot lot better if you're going around the club having lots of fun in lots of different context„ÄÇ

 maybe going to go get pizza than afterwards going to play blackjack going skinny dipping on the beach when you take that girl you're leading her and then you're doing all these different fun things with her either in the club or outside of the club„ÄÇ

 it creates a much more textured experience she can see that you are the same guy in those different contexts and she has this fun story All these girls want a fun story she has this fun story around how you guys met which helps her give„ÄÇ

For why she's going home with you„ÄÇ one of my buddies from his hometown will actually meticulously structure his dates„ÄÇ

 so that's going through all sorts of different contexts„ÄÇ He'll do like 30 minutes„ÄÇ

 maybe getting dim sumÔºå and then he'll go to an arcade and then he'll go to some thing where you can try on virtual reality and then he'll pop by his friend's party He's going through all these different context because multiple context equals connection and also allows her to see that he is the same guy in all these different context„ÄÇ

 These dates only last maybe two or three hours but she feels like she's known him forever One final note on social media and how this relates to getting girls„ÄÇ

 My thoughts on this is that you should either be really„ÄÇ

 really good at it as in you have thousands of Instagram followers you're able to take pictures very consistently if you having this fun life„ÄÇ

 you have a nice camera you're getting good pictures and just generally your fucking Instagram or whatever the fuck is amazing or just cut it out of your life altogether„ÄÇ

 think it should reallyÔºå really be one or the other and most of you guys aren't gonna be that good at it so which is better to cut it out„ÄÇ

 Why cut it out„ÄÇWellÔºå number oneÔºå because those things are fucking useless for anything productive„ÄÇ

 extremely useless„ÄÇ They get you comparing yourself to other people„ÄÇ And also„ÄÇ

 let's say that you have a Facebook and you friend a girl that come around your social circle and she's now seeing your Facebook„ÄÇ

 If all your pictures suck They're only getting like three likes and they're of you doing lame shit„ÄÇ

 What kind of story does this tell to this girl about your life„ÄÇ

 What kind of story does this tell about how many people there are on your life„ÄÇ

 how many people defer to you If you're someone like Brandon Carter„ÄÇ

 you're getting thousands of likes per pictureÔºå it's an amazing„ÄÇ

 amazing way to get those girls from your social circle or to show girls that you're already dating„ÄÇ

 But if you're not and you don't know how to do that„ÄÇ

 probably better to just cut it out of your life altogether It can only hurt you One social media platform that I think is worth using is Snapchat„ÄÇ

 Why because there's not this like shit„ÄÇ So it's not based off other people's opinion„ÄÇ

 and also it's a oneway street„ÄÇ these girls are basically able to just look at your shit without you having to engage in the„ÄÇ

platform all that much And there's really two ways that you should use Snapchat One is showing your adventure„ÄÇ

 you knowÔºå showing all the different events that you're going to and then one is showing your personality and humor„ÄÇ

 Our buddy Graham is extremely extremely good at that„ÄÇ

 He will just make these snaps of him telling part of his day he happens to be amazing at that and he will actually get girls off Snapchat that he hasn't talked to for years because it's just so fucking funny„ÄÇ

 So next we're gonna be talking about taking girl home actually making sex happen and then relationships after that sex happens„ÄÇ

Book recommendationÔºå level up your life by Steve Camp Exse„ÄÇ

 spend this next weekend designing a personal style and living space style that demonstrates an archetype that is fun and congruent with who you are„ÄÇ
