🎼我是社交光谱莱特，那么我们继续蓝图2。0之旅。本次呢我们又是一节实操课，我们可以看到泰勒去引导学员去突破自己的心理障碍来提升视。

want to do this one last vocal exercise right now。 And in doing so。

 my main goal here is I want to get it to where。You beat this projection issue。 So when you speak。

 you should be able to be heard to the back of a room very easily。But it's a huge problem。 Okay。

 so you come up here。Yep， yep， you were correct， pointing yourself。Okay， let's get you up here。

And likewise， let's get you up here right now， okay？So。Just go what's happening there。 What's。

 What's his voice doing him saying， don't mate。His entire voice is built。 Mo to the front。

 You move to the front。 His voice is built to not mate。 Can you see it。

It's specifically designed to make sure nobody will mate with him。I'm not even trying。

 Show me as hard as you can。Look that I'm not trying。 He's trying as hard as he can。

 And I'm how much percent louder am I。让我饭。look at this， watch this， here's a power projection。

 watch this。😡，That's not even loud。Go as loud as you can。呃。

The that as loud as you can you believe no。Show me he I'm barely trying。I'm barely trying。Okay。

 loud as you can。I'm going to barely try guys， I at 13% louder than him at 100%。You see that。

 So what's happening is his mind is like no， no， no， no， no， no， no， no， no， don' let him mate。

 don't let it mate。 We't know the alpha is。 We don't know who the alpha is。😡，It's all tribal。

 It's just， it's all tribal。 His mind doesn't want him to mate because he doesn't know who the alpha is。

 and there's a fear that what could happen is that the alphas could come harm him。 Now。

 in most of human evolution， was there a police force。No。

 so what would happen if you mate with the little alpha Pas mates， what happens？You die。

 So that's a survival mechanism。 It's a vestige of survival。 It's meant to block you question。

I don't know， let's try， think about mating， okay， now try。Oh。I guess it does。ll out， you know。

 pull out like a porn side on your phone。 you're like。Okay， you give it a try。Laジ again。Good。

 now he's doing it， which is great， but he's forcing the physiology is the inner game there yet or no？

Okay， but you're doing great sound， though， that's great， Okay。

 so watch you do as loud as you can and I'll try to match you go ahead。

go as loud as you physically can。Hey， what's up guys， I'm not even going that loud。

 he's giving everything he has。Okay， so it's， it's a trick of the mind。 In effect， right。

 let's get you up here to do it。 You're gonna just get crusher。嗯。Okay， show me。Yeah。

 this is likes a dumpster fire right here。 Everything in him right now is like dont mate with me。

 don't mate with me， don't mate with me。 Don't with me。 Don't mate with me。

 I don't know who the alpha is and I'm scared。 I'm scared。 I'm scared。 I'm scared。 I'm scared。

 I'm scared。 I'm not smart。 I don't think I don't apply for high status jobs。 I don't do anything。

 I'm just a nice man。 Just nice。 leave me alone。 Nothing to see here。 There's nothing to see here。

 Not me。 Don't assassinate me。 don't hurt me。 don't mate with me。 I'm just a nice， nice guy。

 I put up my eyebrows。 I shake my head。 I don't have a thought That is not condoed by。Google。

 I don't think anything wrong。 No wrong thing here。 I'm my sheep。

 but you tell me to do something horrible。 as long as it's coming from upstairs。

 I'm just following orders。 I'm nice。 I'm nice。 Oh， I pulled the string。 Why do I do that。

 He said to do it。 I'm just following orders。 Just a nice guy。 just nice guy。

 I'm just a nice little guy。 I just kill three other people。 but I just following orders。

 I'm a nice guy。 I'm a nice guy。 He's a mean one。 Go kill him。 go kill him。 Im just nice。

 I'm just nice。 I'm just nice at me。 Look at me。 I do what I don't just follow orders。

 don't maybe me。 so that's that's pretty much right。😊，Fuck this so， okay， so we got to fix that。

 Okay， remember I they' got to add pain。 Okay， like there's no， I don't trust you。

00% you're the guy that just violent orders。 It's not。

 you think independently thinking people during some kind of massive murder situation。 Do that。 No。

 they're like， what are you talking about， Are you crazy。 Stop。 You know， it's， okay。

 that's why it's dangerous to have a sociopathic leader because the majority of people in a D state。

 and they'll literally just rally them to do anything。 You ever see these crazy movies。

 like they're charging down like like， you know， from like the old and medieval era。

 they're charging down some cliff like all slaughtering each other。 You ever look at that're like。

 there's no way I'm doing that。 And yet it used to happen all the time。😡，Happened to all the time。

 part of regular life。So people will just fall in orders， man， a， the nice guy is not a nice guy。

 a nice guy is just somebody who's hiding at the center and is just falling orders。

 No wrong things to me。 none of the naughty thoughts， I't just following orders。

 So if we want to create a society of leaders， We've got to make it to where that's not an acceptable thing。

 You've got if you're gonna be a nice guy。 be a nice guy for a real reason for real core values for ethics to make the world better because you want to leave an impact。

 What would you die for， Ask yourself questions like that。😡，し名。It wants to come out。 Show me again。

 He， say， I wouldn't pull the rope。 I wouldn't pull the rope。 I'm not part of a genocide。

 I'm not part of a genocide。 I'm okay to ma。 I'm okay to ma， really， though really， though。

 I know you don't believe me。 I know you don't believe me。 I really want to。😊，I really would like to。

 though， I really like to， though。I don't think I'm going to get killed for mating for mating He looks at the ground。

 let' you see it？I don't think I'm going to get killed for me。 He thinks he's going to get killed。

 He actually does。He may not largely have thought of it， but it's unconscious。Okay。

 look at the crowd say I'm not going to get killed for mating。I'm not going to get killed for mating。

 Sa I am going to be say I am going to get killed for mating。 I am going to get killed by matie。

 okay。Okay， it's it's， it's a fear based thing。 Someone's got to come in and have an intervention。

 right， That's what this week it is。 We've got three more days， right。

 we're barely even scratching the surface here。 Okay， so show me projection again。 grab the mic。Okay。

 so he's getting there， he's looking more comfortable， he's coming out of it， and again。

 the degree to which his voice is doing this is the degree to which his thoughts are in a high fidelity mode。

😡，Me being able to go means I can also come up with improvisational seminar。

 It also means I can come up with products。 It also means I can go meet somebody and have things to talk about and not need the secret line。

 So okay， which to me is like a joke。 So Mo your hands in it just to get the energy moving。😡。

We your hands。he's moving right the movement actually gets you out of your head。

 so why people like to dance， it gets you out of the head， you take so much action。

 you shut down the thinking mind， say it with me， take so much action。

 you shut down the thinking mind。😡，So what you're seeing here is like， just go。う。

You see how it's a little bit easier what he's moving。 You see that。

 We'll talk about that more later。 The movement shuts down the thinking mind。

 or if the whole tribe does it。 part of why people love dances like the macarna is because everybody else is doing it So it's safe or they like a song with lyrics that everybody can sing together because it's safe or they want to go to that rave Well practice Molly。

 but also because it's safe So it's like what you did is is people like to be in an environment where if everybody's moshing。

 it's like oh now I can。 but I want to get you to the point that you don't rely on everybody doing that。

 one of my favorite things to do on boot camp is starting the mosh pit。

 I want to be the guy starting the macarna starting the mosh pit。😡。

I want to be the one that's the leader getting everybody else to do it。

 I do this on boot camp all the time。 I start dancing circles。 Everybody's around me。

 I'm going crazy。 The whole crowd's cheering， going psycho。 I do it all the time on program。

 I want to teach you to be the person who's the leader， not the person who's the sheep。

 because here's what happens in these situations。 Okay。

 Sa that you are say like one guy starts dancing。Then another guy comes。

 There maybe be a few more come。 What will happen across a tipping point where most people are sitting there in in frozen in a frozen state。

 right， like how your mind is generally frozen， which is why you can't apply for better jobs Because your brain's frozen。

 So what's happening is you're sitting here and you're frozen。 But then when everybody。

 when enough other people start to dance， why why does why does the person who's frozen suddenly jump up。

 why。😡，It's the permission seeking， but also what's more dangerous at that point？

When half the crowd has started dancing， what's more dangerous now to not dance。 So now they're like。

 oh， the safe thing is dance， Be， you know， and then they come， bad， be， be， you know。

 what are we doing， Be， are you doing so。YouSo that's what winds up happening。

 So that's why people love it when everybody's doing it because it gives permission。

 which is great because like， say that we will all yell together right now。

 Look how easy it is when we all do it together right。 just go everybody now go。😊，Stop right。

 But then， and see how easy that is。 But then say， I tell you to yell that same loudness。 Do it now。

 right， He can't healed。 He actually did decent and he could remember what it's like。

 But now watch it with the crowd。 watch how much easier it is crowd。😊，Now single， single。 okay。

 so you can remember it。 Remember I said that psychedelic thing。

 Like you have the moment tried to remember it。 So before in the group。

 I could see a smile When I said it alone， you look scared and retracted。

 Then we did it again in the group， you smiled。 And then actually on your own， you smiled a bit more。

 Everybody again，😊，Sup。Now do it on your own。Here， stand up here。Yell to the group， okay。

 yell stand like right here。😡，Okay， face the group。😡，DoNL？Stop everybody together。Alone。A bit better。

 Can you see that， he has some what would you rate him in terms of internal permission out of hand。

 where would you rate him？I'd aim around a seven， okay？Because I'm not just going at volume。

 I'm also going at like resonance and the richness of it， okay e。Do it， it's rich。

 it's seasonally rich， okay， okay， could you give everybody a hand up here？はい。

So what we'll do to wrap the day？Hop in your groups and practice the projection both in the group and solo。

 Okay， you guys jump back there with me。 Everybody else go solo or do it within your group。

 and I'll come back here in about 8 minutes。 Okay， let's get it going。 hear's some noise。😡。

很多人在公开表达时啊会感到恐惧，不自在，声音无法自然的释放出来，这就是原始的部落思维和生存本能。当然我们要克服这种障碍，仅仅依靠意志力是不够的，因为这种恐惧是下意识的根植于我们身体的本能反应。

我们可以通过肢体动作，比如跳舞喊叫来释放能量，从而绕过大脑的一个控制。当大家一起喊叫的时候，其实我们每个人都能感到安全和被接纳。但当你需要单独去表达时，这种恐惧感又会显现出来。

所以我们为什么会有男同学嘛这种高级的社群就是让大家一起凝聚在一起共同交流。当然，在高级社群中，我也是会作为大家的一个教练啊去给大家进行针对性的解读和练习。通过这种体验式的学习。

让你们可以更清晰的认识到自己的局限，看到提升的一个方向，当你们看到其他人的进步的时候，也会受到鼓舞和启发。一个人的声音是否有力量，它不仅取决于音量，更取决于他的肢体情感意念，是否统一，能否自然的去流动。

他就需要更完美的放下防备，来接纳真实的自我，让内心的力量得以彻底的释放。这是一个需要勇气和练习的一个过程。我们要区分从众和领导两种形态，一个真正有力量的人，应该敢于打破常规，勇于去表达自我。

用行动来影响他人，而不是随波逐流，依赖外界的认可。就有当一个人的内心足够强大的时候，他的声音才能穿透人心，成为一股可以改变世界的力量，想要持续保持高质量的输出能力。

首先需要对文字的逻辑结构有一个清晰的一个认识。因为文字呢其实影响着我们的思想和语言表达本身。语言学家沃尔夫说，我们使用的语言在很大程度上塑造了我们对世界的认知。

这也是我们表达者训练营中所强调和培养的关键技能之一。因为我们接下来会有一个表达者训练营。所以语言表达的一个奥秘，就是真正有影响力的声音来自来自他的内在力量的一个紧密结合。这需要我们突破条件。反射的恐惧。

接纳真实的自我。我反复强调了，一定要接纳真实的自我，用全身心去感受生命的一个律动。就当我们的身体情感意念，完全统一，我们的声音才能够穿透表象触达本质。当我们敢于去释放天性，敢于去彰显自我。

我们就突破了内心的桎梏，活出了生命的本来的一个面目。我们不再是芸芸众生的意愿，而是独一无二的创造表达者，这就叫觉醒。我们将从提现木偶变成了生命的艺术家，从被动的努力变成了自己的主人。好，我们这节课结束。

这几节课呢都是实操性的练习。我希望大家看完之后，能有收获，更好的去表达自己。我是社交光谱莱特。我们这部分初级班的一个内容，其实已经更新完毕了，更多精彩的内容，更多后续的课程，关注公众号社交光谱。
