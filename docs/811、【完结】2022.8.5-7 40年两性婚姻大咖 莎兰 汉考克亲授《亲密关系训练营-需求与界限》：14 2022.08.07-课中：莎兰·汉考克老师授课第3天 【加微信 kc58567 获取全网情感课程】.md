大家好 welcomelcome back。你好欢迎大家回来。So everybody just heard about the latest groups， right？

呃大家刚刚听说了我们近期的一个课程哈。😊，Maybe at the end I say a little bit more about it now you already heard something。

那现在大家已经有一些了解了，课程结束的时候呢，我再会给大家一些具体的信息。I want to see my gallery。 I need to see my translator。

Hi Sharon hi dear it's just good that I see your face and then I feel more connected right so hi everyone I'd like to tell you a little bit about what I want to do with you this evening家一今 for。

😊，And I want to thank you for your really great questions， it really helps me。哦，非常的感谢大家特别棒的问题啊。

这些问题极大的启发了我。And so today I want to talk a little bit about how do you build up self esteem and why is self esteem important？

那今天呢我们将聊一聊我们将如何建立自己的自尊。为什么自尊如此重要？And also， how does self esteem relate to shame because we've talked a bit about shame？

以及自尊和呃羞耻的关系是怎么样？昨天我们已聊了一些关于羞耻的东西。And why do we need to heal shame is because if we have shame。

You know， everybody has shame， let's say it like that。那我们还会讲一下，为什么我们要去疗愈羞耻，每一个人都有羞耻感。

 and it's very important that you understand we don't want to get rid of shame because we can't非常重要的是。

我们需要去了解，我们无法完全的去摒弃羞耻感。We want to become friendly with it。我们想要做的是与之友好的相处。And you know。

 it's so interesting everybody has shame， men have shame， women have shame。

 it comes through the way that we were brought up， we all have it。非常有意思的是啊，每一个人都有羞耻感，男人有女人有。

它是来自于我们被养育过程当中的一些经历。 and it's important to understand that shame is not always bad。而我们需要了解羞耻感，不总是坏的。

Because shame can also help us to become better people。因为修饰感能够让我们去变成一个更好的自己。

So let's start from the beginning， let me start from。Why do we need to have self？Esteem for intimacy。

那让我们从那让我们开始吧，开始的时候让我们讲一讲为什么在亲密关系当中，我们需要有自尊。Intimacy means two people meeting in。

Openness in honesty and interest， that's what intimacy means。亲密意味着两个人开放信任的遇见。And intimacy also means。

😊，When I am with you， I want to take down my walls and let you in。那亲密关系也意味着，当我遇见你的时候，我愿意放下自己的高墙，让你进来。

 and I also want you to take down your walls and let me in。那同时我也希望你能够放下自己的高墙，让我进去。

If I come to a relationship with all my walls and all my shame and you come with all your walls and all your shame。

 there's no。Love， there's no。Energy， there's no no。No meeting。如果我们两个人在遇见对方的时候，都各自带着高强和彼此的这种羞耻感。

那么两个人就不会有真正的遇见，不会有真正的爱。All there is is my hopes that what you will give me and your hopes。

 what I will give you。那么在这样的情况下，两个人仅仅是怀抱着各自对对方的希望和期待，认为你能给我什么。 and if we have shame。

 we we too we don't know how to open ourselves because we feel that。

We don't have anything good inside， so it's better to hide than to open。羞耻感让我们没有办法全然的打开自己。

因为我们会觉得我们的内在没有任何好的东西可以去分享，我只能藏起来。 So I wanted to say a little bit before we do the morning meditation and exercises because the morning meditation today is about learning how to open yourself。

那么今天早晨我们的静心呢是学习如何打开自己。那在这个进心之前呢，我想讲一讲有呃与打开相关的东西。So let's just start with a simple meditation to get you in the body in the present moment and we're going to do some breath exercises that open you up。

OK那我们可以做一些先做一些小小的练习啊，安顿下来，扎根下来之后介上一些呼吸法练习来打开自己好吗？So I'm going to take you through the sequence of the hand positions and then we're going to move it into a much more powerful breathing exercise那首先呢我们先进入到这个手的姿势。

也就是手印的练习之后呢进入到一个更强大的呼吸法的练习当中。Okay， so I would like the music。

 I would like the soft music to start and then I'll have a little bit stronger music。

 but let's start with the triangle and this triangle is a way to love yourself。那我们先从这个三角形的收音开始。

这个三角形是爱自己的方式，请工作人员在前半段帮我们放轻柔的音乐，后面呼吸法的时候可腔烈一点。So let's all do that so we can see each other the hands of the triangle wait for the music他们可以先把首音做好。

等待音乐响起。🎼And when you feel the triangle， press your hands together so you feel your fingers touching。

我们可以用指尖去轻轻加一点压力去感受到两只手。And then closing your eyes。闭上双眼。🎼And bringing your attention to your body。

🎼将注意力放到身体上嗯。🎼Yeah。🎼嗯。🎼And we always start with your lower body。

 and you can put your hands down there in your lap。现在可以将双手放在大腿上了。Letting the fingers touch softly。

🎼指间轻柔的相处。😔，bringing your awareness to your feet and your legs so you feel your lower body。

🎼把觉察带到你的双脚和双腿，这样你就能够感受到身体的下盘。🎼And feel where your body touches the chair， your seat。

 as if you are very connected to your body and to the earth。感觉你的身体与椅子触碰的位置。🎼就好像你的身体连接着大地。🎼稳稳的扎根。

🎼And one way to open yourself is to connect to your body。🎼打开自己的一种方式是连接身体。

🎼And when you connect to your body in this way， you connect to your deep true self。

🎼A very deep part of you that we need to come close to someone。🎼当你如此的连接身体，你就能够连接身体最真实的自己，这是一个深层的自我。

当我们走进亲密关系里，我们需要经有这深层的自我才能与他人连接。🎼And then you raise your right hand and you take your fingers and you press three fingers against your right hand and relax your hand。

🎼然后我们可以将右手举起来，把左手的三根手指，用左手的三个指尖触碰右手的掌跟，指根在手掌的。🎼是根的部位，然后再放到大腿上。

🎼Now I'd like you to start to breathe deeply to your belly slowly and deeply because as you breathe。

 you open yourself。🎼现在我邀请你用腹部做深层的呼吸。🎼当你能够深层的呼吸，你就在打开自己。🎼And as you breathe。

 it's as if you're breathing love into your body。🎼在你呼吸的同时，却感受你的一吸一呼，好像都是爱。你正在把爱带进身体里。

🎼And as you breathe， feeling your whole body， your feet， your seat， your hands， and your breath。

 so full awareness。🎼在你呼吸的同时，去感受你的双腿、双脚、坐骨以及全身。🎼你有的全身的解觉知。Now we change over， left hand up。

 right hand touching。🎼现在我们将换另一侧做手验。🎼右手的三根手指指尖触碰左手的指根。🎼然后放下。

Just feel how pleasurable it is to connect with yourself， to feel at home in yourself。🎼去感受这种与自己连接的喜悦。

😔，🎼回归自己如家一般的喜悦。🎼Yeah。🎼And then you let go your hands and any excess emotion， you simply release it。

Through your hands and your arms slowly， slowly。我们将解开手印。🎼双手轻柔的在侧面活动，去感受到自己有任何情绪，都可以缓慢轻柔的通过手臂和双手释放。

s right就是这样。非常好。🎼And then we going like请界从这开始从前面。🎼's like cleaning your auracle your boundaries就好像在净化你的场域。

🎼非常好啊。😔，Ass good enhance to your heart。🎼双手来到心口。😔，And now we're going to do a breath exercise that I think is very beautiful。

You take your hands from your legs and you bring them up to your heart with an in breath。

现在看我们这是吸气的动作，双手从腹部上胸到心口吸气。And then you turn your hands around and bring the energy back to the earth。

三掌呼气，向下，把能量带回大地，就是这样一吸一呼。吸气，掌心向上。呼气，翻掌向下that's right， bringring the energy。

 I will sit for one minute and I will just talk to you。Do you just close your eyes？🎼啊请大家安静的闭眼坐在这里。

🎼聆听。🎼我的预言。🎼So as you're sitting here， let yourself make contact with the adult part of you。🎼当你坐在这里。

请连接到你成年的自己。 The adult part of you that really wants to be in an intimate relationship。🎼你成年的自己。

渴望进入到一段亲密关系里。🎼And meeting that adult part of you。🎼遇见你成年的部分。😔。

🎼If you're a man or a woman doesn't matter， the adult part of you that wants to grow。

 wants to heal the wounds of the past。🎼无论你是男是女，你那成年的部分都渴望成长，渴望疗愈过去所有的伤同。

That wants to come close to somebody and share your love with somebody。🎼他渴望走进一个人，与他分享自己的爱。

🎼I really meet that part of you， even if that part of you is afraid to be hurt or afraid to be left。

 that's natural， that's okay。🎼去真正的靠近去遇见你自己的那个部分吧。即便他特别害怕受伤，特别害怕被别人抛弃，这都是非常自然的。

And I want you to say inside， I am ready。To have。🎼A good relationship。 I am ready。

🎼To have a good relationship， it's not just I want， but I am ready， it's more powerful。

 I am ready to have a good relationship。🎼我邀请你 relationship。🎼邀请你在内在对自己说。🎼我准备好去拥有一段好的亲密关系。

🎼我准备好去拥有一段好的亲密关系。🎼是我准备好，不仅仅是我想要我准备好这样的陈述更加的强大。🎼And it takes courage， it's not easy。🎼这需要勇气，这并不容易。

🎼And I am ready to learn how to love myself， yeah。🎼以及我准备好去爱我自己。😔，And when you say that。

 you give yourself a hug。🎼当你说这句话的同时，可以好好的抱抱自己。🎼就像这样好好的抱抱自己，说我准备好爱我自己。Yeah。🎼I am worthy of love。

 I deserve love， really， let yourself father。🎼以及我值得拥有爱。🎼我值得被爱。😔。

And being ready for love also is I feel ready to heal my shame。I feel ready to heal my shame。🎼准备好迎接爱。

也意味着我准备好疗愈自己的羞耻感。And now letting the music go coming back to the space。🎼那请音乐退去，让我们回到当下的空间里。Yeah。

So before we talk， just feel that you are connected to yourself。

 your heart is open and your energy is flowing。那在我们继续讲之前，请感受一下你扎根于自己，你的心是打开的，你的能量是流动的。

And this is the way we prepare for a relationship， we prepare ourselves。

We bring out the best of ourselves。这就是我们那一段关系需要做的准备。经有这样的准备，我们能够把自己最好的自己带出来。

So I want to say a few words about how do we work with our needs。

 because this whole workshop has been about needs。and boundaries。那么我现在想说几句啊，我们将如何去处理自己的需求？

因为这个工作坊的核心就是需求与界限。So all of us， when we look back to our families of origin。

 which is where we learned about love and where our first needs were visible。那当我们去学习或者说去看向自己原生家庭的时候啊。

我们会发现原生家庭就是我们学习爱、学习界限与需求的场语。 So it's very important to know。

How you learned about love in your family， it's the place where our character is formed。

所以这个时候我们就需要去看到我们在原生家庭当中是如何学会爱的。就是在这样的时间段，我们的性格开始形成。 and for many of us。

We didn't always get what we needed in our families， I think we can all safely say that。

我想每个人可能都会去这样觉得我们在原生家庭当中的很多需求都没有被满足。So part of being ready to heal our wounds is to feel。

And be ready to feel that we didn't always get what we wanted and that's sad。所以准备好去疗愈自己。

很多时候也意味着我们也准备好了去面对那一个很多需求都没有被满足的自己，这是一个非常悲伤的事实。All of us have some sadness from our childhoods about what we did not get that。

 I would say， all of us have that。😔，我们每一个人都有这样一个很多需求未被满足的童年，而这一份悲伤都在我们的内在。

Some of us have sadness about our mothers， some of us have sadness about our fathers。

 but there are pieces that were missing in all of us。很多人的悲伤是关于父亲的，很多人的悲伤源于自己的母亲，但我们的内在都有或多或少缺失的部分。

And by allowing us to feel the sadness。About some of the things that happened or did not happen in childhood actually prepares us for adult love。

精由去感受自己内在的这一份悲伤，去面对儿时发生过的某些事情，或者没有发生的事情，能够让我们准备好成年的人生。

 It's not easy what I'm saying because we don't want to feel that sadness。

 but by allowing us to feel that sadness。 it brings us。Closer to our own true self。我知道我说的并不容易。

因为我们都不想去感受这一份悲伤。但如果我们能够去直面这一份悲伤，去感受它的话，他就能够让我们走进更加真实的自信，真实的自己。And by feeling our wounded feelings。

 just feeling them it。Puts us on the path to intimacy。而金牛去感受自己的这份伤痛，仅仅是感受，就能够让我们走向通往亲密的道路。

Because unless we feel that。We will always look for somebody to give us what we didn't get in childhood。

 that's the truth。因为如若我们不去面对自己的这份伤痛，我们就将永远向外搜寻着某个人来满足自己童年的这份需求。

Is that clear like by feeling what we didn't get， feeling the sadness？

It brings us closer to ourselves and creates the。The path to healthy intimacy because。

但我们能够去感受自己的这一份悲伤，我们就能够走向通往亲密关系的道路。因为。Because this makes us an adult， if we don't feel that。

 if we don't allow ourselves to feel that， we remain a child， but a child with a basket of needs。

 a child that is hungry。因为我们去感受的这份悲伤啊，这份勇气，它能够让我们呃走进成年人的世界。若我们不去感受它，我们就将。保持在一个孩童的状态，一个拥有着成千上万需求的孩童。

And you know， that's not easy because we come to relationships。

Expecting our partner to be a perfect parent right they're going to give us everything that we didn't get we come expecting our wife to be a mother and our husband to be the perfect father。

这说起来并不容易啊，呃，这做起来并不容易。因为当我们走进一段亲密关系里的时候，我们会期待自己的伴侣成为那一个完美的父母。我们会希望自己的丈夫是一个完美的父亲，或希望自己的太太是完美的母亲。

And maybe in the beginning， they can give you some of what you need， but sooner or later。

They cannot continue because it's。What we call it is too big an expectation to put on another person。

也许在一开始的时候，他能够去满足你的这份期待，但是他是无法持续去做到这样的。因为这一份期待实在是太过于沉重了。

It's what we call unrealistic expectations when the child in us。

 especially the child who is so hungry， is so lonely， needs so much love， so much attention。这样的一份期待。

我们把它叫做是不切实际的期待。特别是你内在的这份孩童，对于爱如此的如饥似渴，如此的孤单，如此的悲伤。那对于另一个人来说，就是不可能的期待。

 Because if we come so hungry it eventually is going to drive the other person away because that isn't what an adult relationship should be。

这样的一份如饥似磕，早晚将会把你的另一半亲密的另一半赶走。因为这并不是一段成年人的亲密关系。 And sooner or later， those relationships。

 they break down， we feel disappointed， we feel angry， we feel betrayed， or we simply feel distant。

 like。No connection。这样的一段亲密关系，早晚都会消亡，都会陨落。在这样的关系里，我们会感觉到失望，会愤怒，感受到与对方非常的遥远。

Now I know this is difficult， I really know it's difficult。

 especially if we were brought up in families and I think most Chinese families don't put a lot of emphasis on individual needs。

我们在加关 the culture。我们会在这样的关系里感受到背叛。那这是一个非常艰难的关系。特别是在中国这样的文化当中，我们成长的过程没有被太多的教导去重视个人的需求，往往会产生这样的结局。

 And in fact， the Chinese society has really good family structure at is a very powerful society。

 but it doesn't always help us in personal relationships。 We have to learn additional skills。

那当然中国的世界啊，中国的社会格局，还有他的家庭组成呃，都是非组织的，是非常的强大有效的。不过让人失望的是，很多关于关系的课程确实在其中缺失的。所以这是我们需要自己补足的部分。And it。

 you know， even if we didn't learn it in childhood and most of us didn't。

 it's not too late to learn a little bit now as adults。即便我们小的时候错失了这样的功课，但是现在作为成年人，我们开始学习也为时不晚。

So the first thing is I want to talk about the two styles， how you deal with your needs。

那么首先呢我想跟大家聊一聊我们去处理自己需求的两种风格。Okay， when we work with needs there are two styles we call one the adult style and the other the child style当我们在面对需求的时候我们可以把它分成两种需求一种是成年式的需求一种是孩童式的需求 Okay so if you were。

A person who never let yourself feel the sadness or even the pain of。

What you missed in your childhood， then you will be stuck in the child part of expressing your needs and I explain it。

如果你从未允许去感受自己来自于童年的这一份伤痛或者需求没有被满足的这些过往，那么你就将容易卡在孩童事的需求世界里。我现在给大家解释一下。

So when we're in the child energy， we call it an energy。we are very emotional。当我们在孩童的能量当中，记住。

我们把它叫做能量，我们就会变得非常的情绪化。And we can become very demanding。

 I need it and I need it now and you have to give it to me。我们就会变得非常的过度的索取。也就是说我现在就需要这个你一定要满足我。 know。

 in the in the when I used to come to China， we used to do these psychodrama。

 and my team was excellent。当我曾经来到中国上线下课的时候，我们会去做心理剧。那当时我的团队非常的棒。

 one of the psychoras we used to do was of the dependent woman and the antidepend man。

那曾经我们经常做的一个心理剧呢，它是由一个这种依赖者，是一个女性，反依赖者是一个男性这样的两个角色组成的。

 And we would have the dependent woman calling the husband four times。

 five times in the day when he's at work。那在这个剧中呢，我们会让依赖者的这位女性去给自己反依赖者的男性一天打四五次电话，而这个反依赖者的男性正在工作当中。

但 she was very emotional and he would say I'm working and she would call again and again because her needs were so big that she it was never enough。

 she wanted a lot of contact all the time。那这个女性呢她会非常的轻松啊。这个男性说我还在工作呢，但是这个女性却一遍一遍的给她打电话，因为她的需求如饥似渴。

是无法被满足的。她特别需要连接，需要别人的关注。So that's the child， it can be very emotional and it can。嗯。

Reach out again and again because it wants the contact so badly。这个就是海同事的需求，他将会一次一次如饥似渴的去索取，他非常需要关注。

And this leads to a lot of drama because then the antidepend would say， stop calling me。

I'm working I'm not available， wait。😡，那么这个就将导致非常多的戏剧性的效果。因为这个反意性反依赖型的人格就会说不要再给我打电话了，我在工作，现在不行。

And the dependent would feel hurt， but you're my husband。I can call you if I want。 I need contact。

 and。It doesn't matter if you're working， I need to hear your voice。

 you see this is how the frightened child， the child who has so many needs how this child behaves。

那这个依赖者就会说，但是你是我老公啊，我就想听你的声音，我就想要你的关注。那么这个时候呢，他内在就是一个吓坏了的，或者说需求非常多无法被满足的一个孩童的能量。

And usually this becomes more emotional， both parts become emotional and maybe they even have a fight那一般来说。

这样的情况就会让两个人都处在情绪化的状态里，也许最后会导致两个人激烈的争吵。So the child part cannot wait to get its needs met。

 it needs it now。And this puts a lot of stress on a relationship。也就是说，孩童的这部分的能量，他是无法去等待。

耐心的等待自己的需求被满足的一切都需要发生在现在。那么这个呢就给反依赖者带来诸多的压力。 and this we call。It goes to conflict。那这一切就将会导致冲突 Now。

 if we look at what does the adult needs look like， The adult need would look something like this。

 I have a need for contact。 You would。Take responsibility for your need you would。

Connect with it in yourself first， I have a real need for contact。那我们现在看一下成年式的需求是怎样的。成年式的需求啊看起来是这样。

我有一个受关注的，或者我有一个连接的需求。那首先我看到自己的需求，我将为自己的需求负责。 because in the child state， This is important。

 The child state only feels its needs。 It does not see the boundaries of the other person。

那么一个孩同学的需求又怎样呢？孩同事的需求有怎样的区别呢？关键点在这里啊，孩同事的需求，他只看到自己看不到别人的状态，没有任何的界限，他也不在乎是否有界限。

The child part doesn't care about the other person。

 it only cares about itself and it's very desperate。那孩子的部分不在乎别人，只在乎自己，而这一份对自己的在乎是非常狼狈和极端的。

And that never works， it either creates conflict。Or it creates distance。那这样的一种状态，他是永远不会带来有效的结果。

他要么就会去创造冲突，要么就会带来更加疏远的距离。The adult state is completely different。

 it respects itself and it asks permission from the other。那么成年人的需求就完全不同。他首先呢会尊重自己的需求，其次他将会去请求别人的允许。

It says something like this I have a need for contact and I want to talk to you in the day when you're in the office我们可以这样去尝试一下成年时的需求我有一个想要跟你基础的渴望。

那么当你有空的时候，我们可以在你的办公室聊一聊。Because when I don't have contact I feel anxious and I feel scared and when I have contact I feel calm I feel secure因为我感受不到跟你的连接接触的时候。

我会觉得非常的害怕和焦虑当我能够感觉到与你的连接我就觉得有安全感了。That's intimacy， you talk about yourself and you ask permission。

 so I would like to call you， is that okay for you？那这个就是成年式的一种亲密关系的需求啊。也就是我知道我有这样的需求，我想要跟你建立连接。

是不是对你来说是可以的。所以有请求允许的部分在里面。 the other person feels seen。 they feel respected。这个时候另一方呢他会感觉到自己被看见和尊重。

 and when we feel seen and we feel respected， we are much more likely to be open and available。

那当我们感受到自己被看见和尊重的时候，我们就更容易去打开自己，并且更愿意去跟对方配合。So that person can then say。嗯。In the morning。

 I'm in meetings， you can't call me， but I will call you in the afternoon when I have a break。

那么这个人可能会说啊早晨的时候你不要给我打电话，因为我在开会，下午的时候休息的时候，我就会打电话给你的。So this is how adults behave。

 they don't expect the other person to know what they need。那么这个就是成年人他的行为的模式，他并没有期待说对方一定要知道我的需求是什么。

 I expect my partner to know what I need， and I am not saying anything。

 I will be disappointed because。How should he know what I feel and what I need。

 if I don't speak about it。很多时候我们会期待啊，在自己不告诉对方的前提下，对方就能知道我们所有的需求。但是若我们不说对方怎么可能知道呢？这一切都将会带来失望。

I think it's really important if you are already in a marriage and many people have written to me and said I'm in a marriage and I don't feel close。

 what should I do so this is what I think。那，如果你在一段婚姻当中啊，呃有很多人给我写信呢，会说我已经结婚了，但是我却感受不到亲密，我该怎么办呢？

那接下来 I know this is not easy。 but if you're in a marriage and you want to improve your marriage。

我知道你的境况非常的艰难，但如果你在婚姻当中，你想提升婚姻的质量。A very good start is to say to your partner。

 I would like to to talk to you about needs， I would like to know what you need in our marriage I would like to know。

那么一个很好的开始，就是你可以对你的伴侣说，我想跟你聊一聊关于需求的部分。我想要了解在我们的婚姻当中，你的需求是什么呢？ because if I know what you need。

 I could be a better partner。因为如果我了解了你的需求，我就能够成为更好的伴侣。And I would really be happy for you to tell me。

而是如果你能告诉我的话，会非常快乐。Now I know this is not easy， but relationship isn't easy and then you would say and I also would like to tell you what I need so we can start to talk to each other。

我知道啊这个听起来并不容易，但是关系本来就是艰难的。那么这个时候呢，你可以跟巴黎说说我的需求是这样的。这样的话，你们双方的谈话就开始了。

And I know this isn't easy because if I have shame about my needs。

 it's very difficult to talk about it， but we have to start somewhere。我知道这个听起来非常的艰难啊。若我们对于自己有一种羞耻感的话。

我们就将不会去谈论自己的需求。但是若想要进营一段关系，总该要找一个开始的起点才行。 and an amazing thing happens when you can talk about your needs。

Some relaxation comes。当你能够去谈论自己需求的时候，你会发会发现一些神奇的变化。首先你就会觉得放轻松很多。

Because this is what happens if you repress your needs， you repress your feelings。因为事情是这样的。

若你去压抑自己的需求，你也就同样压抑了自己的情感。And inside you boiling， there's anger， there's sadness， there's。Frustration。

那当我们压抑了这些感受的时候，这一切五味杂陈杂陈的东西，就在我们内在不断的翻涌，里面有愤怒，有悲伤，还有挫败感。And you know that in a moment。

 suddenly all this energy can explode and that's very scary。而你知道 and for the other person。

而且你也知道总有那么一瞬间，这所有的一切都会瞬间的爆发。那么这种爆发对你跟你的伴侣都是非常不好的。Because that child that didn't get what it needed is emotional。

 it is emotional， it had to keep all the emotions down， control them。

 but those emotions are still inside and they're just waiting to jump out。因为这一个没有被满足需求的孩子，他本就是非常情绪化的。

而这一个孩子，他把这所有的情绪压抑在自己的内在，似看似掌控着一切，但所有的情绪都在那里从未消失。他们只是等待着合适的一瞬间爆发出来。

So the first thing is to accept without shame that you have needs。

 that is such a powerful step towards intimacy。那么第一步呢就是不带任何羞耻感的去接纳自己的需求。那么这个就是走向亲密关系的第一步。

 And I really want you to know， not only women have needs because we're trained that men have no needs and women only have needs。

 It's simply not true。 men also have needs。那么我想跟大家说啊，男人也是有需求的，因为我们好像被教育的是只有女人有需求，男人没有任何需求，但是不是这样。

男人也有需求， but usually it's easier for women to start talking about feelings and emotions because this is。

Men are really trained to be strong and being strong means having no emotions。 It's not correct。

 but that's how we' are trained。只不过呢女人他更容易去表达自己的需求，自己的感受和情绪。因为男人被教育呃。不能够去表达自己的这些，因为他们要变得更加的强大。

强大就意味着不能流露自己的任何的情绪。虽然这样的教育是错误的，但是这就是事实。And it's difficult because if you never talked about it， well。

 we've got to start somewhere so women have needs， men have needs。

 dependents have needs and antidepends have needs， we all have needs， it's human。就非常的不容易啊。

但是我们总要开始着手处理这件事情。所以事实就是男人有需求，女人有需求，所有的人都有需求，依赖者、反依赖者都有需求。

And we have to let go of this idea that it's weak to show your needs。

 many of us believe that we should keep everything in and not show anything if you want to have that you will never have intimacy。

 I promise you。而且我们需要去知道啊，我们若想要亲密关系，我们就一定要去表达自己的需求。很多人会觉得说啊，我可不能表达自己需要这个需要那个，那显得我太弱了。我可以向你保证。

若你带着这样的一种态度，你是永远无法拥有真正的亲密的。We are human。 We have needs。 We all have needs， men， women， dependent。

 anti dependent， and it's so good to start to。Be open about it。 Not ashamed about it。我们是人类，我们都有需求。

男人、女人、依赖者，反依赖者都有需求。我们需要对此敞开，不带任何羞耻感的去看见自己的需求。 So I want to tell you。

 if you want to bring love back into a marriage， you need to work with three things。那我想告诉大家。

若果你想要把真爱重新带到你的婚姻里，你需要做三件事情。These things are the first one is attention to give somebody your attention。

To listen to them， to show them that you care， to look at them。In a friendly way to be。

Give them attention， really simply attention。第一个就是关注。需要去陪伴他，去全然的聆听他，去让他感觉到你在乎。而且。也就是全人的陪伴临在于当下。

And if you're in a couple relationship， it's so important to sit with your partner。

In a in a calm place and say， tell me about your day， how was it？What happened and listen。

 don't take each other for granted， we're not just furniture。而且你也可以找一处非常安静的地方，可以告问问他一天发生了什么事情，跟我聊一聊。

非常专注的去聆听他，不要觉得说两个人在一起久了，好像都习以为常了，不要把对方当成空气或者家具。It's a very simple thing， but it's very。

 very healing because if you feel that somebody cares about you。They care about you。

 something in your heart melts。就是非常疗愈的非常重要的一个举动。因为若你能够感觉到其他人对你的在乎和关注，你的心自然就会融化。

So that's the first thing， attention。It can heal a relationship that has been frozen for years。

那么这就是第一点，也就是关注这个关注能够去融化多年结成的婚姻的坚并。The second thing is affection affection is physical。

 it's how you show your。Your love and your gratitude physically， It's a touch， a hug。Just。

Small things， it's not even sex， it's affection， the way you would hold each other or hug each other some in its physical。

 its body contact， we need physicality。那么第二点呢，也就是好感。这个好感呢，也就是你如何用自己的肢体，用自己的触碰，跟他的身体上的互动去表达对他的喜欢。

对他的感恩。这些生活当中的点点滴滴的表达非常的重要。他甚至都不需要是以性爱的形式呈现的。但是这种身体上的互动非常的关键。

And it doesn't matter a man can come and give his wife a hug。

 a woman can come and give a husband a hug， it's so meaningful because it shows that you care about this。

 it's not even though we want to be loved， we want to feel that somebody cares about it。

 that we matter， that we are important。那么无论是丈夫给妻子一个抱抱还是妻子给丈夫一个抱抱都是可以的。那么这样的一种互动身体上的表达。

它能够让我们感觉到自己是被关注的，被在乎的，这个甚至都无关于是不是被爱。但是我们每个人需要感觉到自己对某些人来说是重要的。 You know， most of us。

 we didn't see this in our families。 You know， we had a lot of discipline， a lot of structure。

 but we didn't have emotional warmth and physical affection。

 So it's very difficult because if we didn't have it as children， we really don't know how to do it。

 but we must learn。那对于我们当中的很多人来说啊，在自己的原生家庭当中完全都没有体验过类似的东西。因为我们的家庭当中有太多的规矩了，没有任何身体上的互动，也没有任何情感上温暖的表达。

那我们既然没有体会过，我们如何能够去把它在带到新的家庭当中的。所以我们就需要去学习这个部分。那么 lot of。

Learning how to be in a relationship is unlearning what you've got in your family now that doesn't mean that you disrespect your family it really doesn't it means that you want to grow in ways that maybe your family didn't show you but it doesn't mean disrespecting your family。

那很多时候我们所说的学习一个新的亲密关系的方法，其实它需要我们去遗忘就有的这种关系的模式。并不是代表我们不尊重或者不忠诚于自己的原生家庭，而是说我们希望能够把原生家庭当中没有的再带入自己崭新的家庭当中。

 and for couples for marriages that don't have。Attention and don't have affection。

 Those marriages grow cold。 They grow distant， and people feel we live in a house。

 but we're totally lonely。And that's not a good place because also。It's sad。而对于那些没有关注，没有好感的婚姻和关系呢。

一定会变得越来越冷漠的。这样大家即便是同住在一个屋檐下，都会觉得我们彼此非常的孤单，两个人距离非常的远，就非常的悲伤。So take a deep breath。

 just take a few breaths， we're going to dance in a minute， just move the body。

 but it's very important that you understand because people ask me how do you have an intimate relationship well this is how。

那么现在我们一起啊注意一下自己的呼吸，深呼吸几次啊，等一下我们就活动一下自己的身体。很多人都会问我这样的问题，如何拥有一个亲密关系。那么现在讲的就是了。And the third thing。

 so you understand attention， affection， being physical， physical， expressing your love physically。

 it's so important。那么刚才讲的就是第一个是你的关注，第二个是好感，而这个好感是需要用你的身体来表达的，用你的身体动作来表达爱。

The third thing is appreciation is gratitude to say if I appreciate you or I'm grateful for you or I honor you or。

I'm so happy you in my life。第三个呢就是我们所说的感恩和欣赏。也就是我非常的感谢你，我非常的欣赏你，我非常的开心你能出现在我的生命里。😊。

Appreciation and gratitude you can say that to your parents。

 it's so beautiful to say that to your parents， to your friends。

 to your children and to your partners。这种感 children to your partners那这种感恩的表达呢适合于我们对自己的父母，对自己的朋友。

对自己的伴侣嗯去表达这些会非常的美好。Now， imagine that you're a child， right。 And suddenly。

 your parents tell you they appreciate you。 Theyre happy that you are their child。

 Can you imagine how wonderful that would have been。😊，你可以去对你的孩子表达。嗯，你能够想象吗？当你如果你是一个孩子，你的父母会说。

我们非常的感激你能够做我们的孩子，你不会觉得非常的美好吗？😊，Imagine if your father came home and said I'm so happy you are my daughter。

 I'm so happy you are my son， you are exactly the child I always wanted去想象一下，如果你是一个女儿或者儿子。

你的爸爸跟你说说啊我非常开心，你能够成为我的儿子，你就是我特别想要的，我梦想中的那种孩子 Now I know most of our parents didn't do that because they didn't want to spoil us我知道我们大部分的父母都没有做这件事情。

因为他们不想把我们宠坏。😊，But one of our emotional needs is to be loved and to be told that you loved can you imagine to hear your mother say I love you and I'm so happy you my child and you bring happiness to my life I mean。

 how how touching is that但是我们其中的一个情感上的需求，就是知道自己是被爱的。

但同时也是被爱着你能够去想象吗当你的父母跟你说说啊我非常的爱你你的存在让我的生命更加的快乐 So if you are parents and you have children because some of you are parents tell your child you are exactly the child I wanted。

😊，I'm so happy that you are my child。imagineag it gives a child confidence， they feel worthy。

 they feel important。去想象你的父母如果告诉你说啊，我太开心你是我的孩子了。当他这样对你说的时候，这个孩子会觉得非常的有自信，有一种油然而生的配德感值得感。😊。

These are small things， but they're so important。这些虽然是生活当中的小事，但是他们却如此的重要。

So I'd like to have just a little bit of discussion about that I'd like to hear some of you say something before I轮轮听听大家馈看大家是不。

Anyone， Alice helped me just to get this working。好的 hear speak好的，那我们先请三班的lisa。嗨夏文老师。嗯。嗯。

我想反馈的就是就是刚刚老师最后那段说那句话，我觉得就是打中我的泪点就是。就是父母如果跟孩子说，你是我是非常开心，你是我的孩子，你就是我想要的孩子，就exactly what I wanted。

你给我的生命带来了欢乐，我觉得非常touch。确实会有一种非常深的配合。And what you just said in the last bit strike me into tears falling down。

And you said you are the kid exactly wanted you exactly the child I wanted yes we all hear just每人都需要听到 and she also said it gives me a strong sense of self worth。

Yes， that's exactly red Scher。是的，他会让我们非常有佩戴感。谢谢。that's very beautiful。thank you so much。感谢你的分享，非常的美好。

O， let me hear from a few more people， please。😊，他让我们再听听其他的同学好，那我们请5班的kily。Yes。Okay， who is it？对嗯。

我我刚刚可能今天有个其他的问题，就是跟这个问题是相关的。所以刚好就问一下。就是老师提到说，比如说第一个是这个attention。嗯，就是我我现在生活里面面临的挑战就是嗯我有很大的生活上的困难要应付。

然后要时间呃给时间到我自己。其实我。我觉得我已经没有这个attention可以给到给到我的伴侣了。嗯，然后嗯。所以我在想就是或者说我我我好不容易找到一点时间的时候，当对方跟我反馈一下他他遇到的问题。

其实我觉得我没有那个包容度去吸收他个。那这个时候我是不是应该就就。就不要做了。OK，你的不要做是不要有亲密关系，还是不要管这个问题了。嗯，就是当我没有这个这个注意力嗯给对方的时候，那我。

Okay and she said you mentioned attention is crucial intimacy and I am now facing many difficulties in my life。

 which requires lots of time， I have no attention left to my partner and even though there is a little bit time for him but I don't feel I'm able to hold what his issues。

 so do I just give up。Well I think that's a really good question sometimes of course you have so much on your own plate that it's difficult。

 but you can't live in that。If you want to be with someone， you have to make space for that person。

 you do。那当然嗯有的时候呢，你可能确实是自己很多的事情忙不过来。但是如果你想跟一个人在一起的话，你必须要去改变自己的这种状况。Okay。嗯。I know， you know。

If you need help for your own issues， you must find that help so that you have some space to show your partner love。

 otherwise。Those relationships become。They become starved of affection。They become like a desert。嗯。

呃如果是你觉得自己的这些事情需要额外的帮助的话，你可以去请求一些帮助。这样的话你就能有一些空间向你的伴侣去展示你的好感和爱，否则的话，这个关系就会像沙漠一样荒凉。

ll giveive you an example， if you have a dog right。

 you have to feed that dog every day and take it for a walk twice a day。你举个例子啊，如果你养一只小狗的话，你每天肯定要去喂它。

并且去遛两次。You can't say for two days I'm really got so much on my plate I cant take you for you don't do that so it's the same when you have a relationship you make space for that you really have to it's not always easy I agree sometimes it's very difficult but you have yourself理我这两天太忙了所以这两天不为你不溜你了所以我们需要去找到时间找到精力去经营这一段关系。

And get what you need from who you need to get it from get support for yourself so that you can be present for your partner。

那这个时候你就要去获取所需要的帮助，看一看谁能够支持你自己的这个部分。这样的话你就能够也支持到自己的伴侣。Okay， thanks， anybody else。On the subject is。

 let's take this person。OK这位同学的那么请四班的赫兹。Okay， go on to see you now。嗯，老师好，嗯，我可以不带羞耻的表达需要。嗯，我表达了需要。

比如说呃我想你多陪陪我，但是老公我们是异地分离，一个月回来三四天，然后他就会说呃我又要赚钱。然后又又是他心里也想赚钱，也想陪我，但是就会带来他很很多我的情绪就是会像孩童般一样出来。

然后就会激发他那种无力感，就是满满足不了我的需求，他就会很无力。昨天晚上就特别的暴怒，就是我的情绪也出来，然后他的也非常的暴怒跟自我攻击。所以。我很想问老师，就是我孩童时期的我的状态，他会出现。

我也想我也想成为一个成年人的状态。 I actually am able to express my knees without any shame。 For example。

 if I tell my husband， I need you to be with me more because we are separating into different cities he would be concerned about his work and being with me at the same time。

 and sometimes the child within me would burst out， saying very。

 very emotional and he would be really furious about it。 I really want to be an adult。

 but that child like me always come up with right， Of course， of course。

 because that is a very challenging situation。Actually and anybody would understand what you feel because you feel left alone for long。

 you know， very very left alone， so it's very important that you ask your husband what he expects of you because you have to say。

I cannot be left alone for too long we must find a way to meet each other Of course you're absolutely right actually实际上面临的挑非常艰但是我们都非常的理解因为真的是非常的孤单那么在这样的情况下你需要告诉你的丈夫说你希望我是怎样的状态因为我是办法忍受长期一个人我们必须要找到一种方式能经常的见面相处才 and it's important that your husband doesn't think that it's okay to just leave you and just abandon you and that's okay it's not okay it's really not okay even if it's his work he has to find a way to respect you and to be sensitive to your needs。

而且对于你的丈夫来说，他不能觉得说分居两地需要工作和赚钱呃，这就是一个常态了。他不能够就是这样呃习以为常。他必须要找到一种方式去陪伴你去尊重你才行。

 and I think you really are trying to be in the adult。 and I think you're doing really well。

 but everybody would freak out if you were suddenly left alone。但是我觉得呢你实际上已经做的很好的。因为你一直在尝试成为一个成年人。

任何一个人长期被抛弃在那里，一个人都会非常害怕，都会非常失控的。You know， separations are very， very provocative。

 so you have to talk to your husband how to manage this as a couple。那么异地这样的关系是非常棘手的。

所以你需要跟他好好聊一聊两个人如何去面对这样的情况。 maybe you arranged to speak every day。

 maybe you arrange to meet every two or three weeks。 but just to leave you alone。 No。

 that's not okay。 That won't work。也许你们可以每天通一次电话呀，或者是呃每一个星期两个星期见一次啊，但是长期的分开肯定是不行的。All right。

 good good point。 and I think you're doing well我觉得你做的已经非常棒了。 I'll take two more好，谢谢老师。😊，好的。

那我们先请二班的项群。对呀。Let's take this person。沙兰老师好哎你好你好，我刚才听完这个三个关注对我来讲，我觉得我印象比较深，就是关注，然后好感，还有就是感恩和欣赏。

我觉得我跟伴侣之间就不太会表达那种关注，不太会表达这个好感，还有这个感恩的时候非常少，不太注意边界。所以我经常会受伤，然后那个关系会变得疏远。当沙兰老师讲了这三个以后。

我我我我我我觉得要从这三个方面要经常进行一个冥想。呃，我我先说这么多，然后请翻译先翻译吧。嗯， and I was benefited by your by you。

Three ways of being in an intimacy relationship， attention， affection。

 appreciation and I really express my affection appreciation to my husband。

 which leads to a hurtful feeling and a distant feeling so I think I need to meditate upon the three ways Yes and he has to show the same to you you know it has to go both ways。

😊，是的，他也需要对你去这样表达，这需要是双向的才行。Try it， honestly， it really works， it really works。是的，就是昨天我还发生了一个这个战战争啊。

就是我们的亲密亲密关系呢就是因为有一点这个疏远，有点疏离了。那昨天呢有一个事情我想帮助他，但是我没有那个实时的去征求他的这个意见，没有注意边界。我还是依据之前跟他的这种理解，然后去帮他之后让他大怒。

然后弄得我自己很很难过，但刚才听了沙拉老师的这个讲解以后，我觉得可能还是我在感知对方情绪发生变化的时候呢，缺少了一些这个觉察，我现在意识到了以后，我也感到不是那么伤伤感了。

And yesterday we just had a fight， I try to。I tried to help him with something he didn't ask for which leads to an emotional disaster I thought that there is a lack of awareness in sensing his knees and emotions and after listening to your course now I know what to do Good work。

 great， excellent thank you let me have one more than were gonna have little dancing take one more a man let's hear about needs。

只能告诉我哪一个是男死，我来看一下。好像没有男生举手诶。I don't see。I can't take one more person。OK那我们请一班的安。

We didn't have a man Okay， one more woman then。Where are I men？男生都去哪了？嗯啊，张老师你好啊，我就是想请教一下嗯。啊。

我我能截察到我的需求是很多时候在给我先生之间是儿童的需求。比如说是很基础的这种安全感呐，还有就是想要得到被保护那样子。因为我的成长环境这其实我想想问一下，就说在这个情况下的话。

我有什么更好的方式可以满足到自己或者就是说当我们确实是看到了儿童的需求。在你看来用什么样更好的方式即可以支持到自己或者是通过先生向先生表达，让他支持到我这样子。

嗯 actuallywhere most of my needs are child likeness I need security and protection due to my family of arranging my question is。

 how do I meet the child needs by myself。Or how can I ask for help from a husband to support me with that in your opinion Yeah that's a good question。

这是个很好的问题啊。Well I think security is important， but it's not the only thing那我觉得安全感非常的重要，但是它不是全部的。

There's security and then there's。The adult， the adult is a sexual adult。

 the adult that likes to have adventures， the adult that likes to do beautiful things together。

 go for a walk， go to a concert， talk about。Important things， you know。

 the security is only one part， it is an important part， but it's not everything。

You have to be creative， you have to。And。Do interesting things， talk about interesting things。

 listen to music， this is where relationship is more than once you are secure then you develop。嗯。

首先呢我们要知道啊这个安全感的需求它非常重要，但是它不是全部的。所以我们要打开这个场域去看看我们还需要做些什么。比如说成年式的需求，他可能有性爱的需求，一起冒险的需求，一起做美好的事情啊。

比如说去散步听音乐会，去聊聊重要的事情，所以我们需要充满创造类的去探索两个人的关系。比如说呃一起聆听音乐。

 know the relationship balances between security and adventure，only security boring，on adventure。

Anxiety， you need the balance between security and adventure and excitement。😊，所以我们的亲密关系呢。

它都像是一个两呃都像是一个平衡木一样，像是一个跷翘板，一边是安全感，一边是冒险和刺激。只有安全感的话就会非常的无聊。只有冒险的话，又会让人焦虑，所以平衡两者就是亲密关系。

 know too much security and over life goes out of a relationship It's like dead如果所有的一切都是安全感的话。

那么这个关系就像死气沉沉的东西一般。 you need some things that are adventure unpredictable。我们需要一些冒险的不可预料的东西。

other just boring否则太无聊了。Oay， listen， let's have some dancingthank you。than you。好让我们一起跳一会舞。

 need a little bit，我们得动一动啊 man。That's okay worry's just不用了。Sorry， I missed that。

 Alice said a man raise同二班的。哎，你好你好。啊，有点不好意思啊，那不好意思说那那个就这个。呃，我那个结婚呢是被那个父母催的。然后呢，当时找对象呢。

就那种心里是有那种很清晰的模样。但是因为父母催婚，然后就找了啊，现在有两个孩子。呃，相恋就是大学认识，谈了7年恋爱，结婚进了是8年再翻一下吧。Hi Sharon。

 I'm a little bit shy to talk about my own issue actually my marriage was because my parents' efforts we met in college。

😊，Now we have two children， so it's totally eight years of marriage。后how is your marriage？

are you happy？你的婚姻怎么样？你快乐吗？快乐no。😊，Okay， all right， that's fine。

Is what would you need from your marriage to be happy。

 What would you need from your marriage in your marriage to be happy，你觉得你的婚姻给你提供什么，你才会变得更加的快乐啊。

我觉得当时吧应该就是。就是找一个就家庭条件差不多。呃，就是不能单方付出的。你像我结婚吧，这个所有的物质吧，全是物质条件吧，全是由我这方单方提供的呃。翻译吧。I think first of all。

 I need someone who could match my financial levels to marry me because I afford all of the material things in the marriage I see。

 I see， I see， but that's that's。You know， if you can afford everything， that's， you know。

 you look after your wife and your family， is it that you say you want your wife to work？你既然能够去负担这些。

那么也就是经有你的这份付出，在照料你的太太和家庭，这不是挺好吗？你是什么意思呢？希望你太太出去工作吗？还是怎样？不不用那个，然后呢，就我我说完吧，然后呢。啊，就那么一直不出，然后突然有一天在婚登记了。

就因为父母催婚嘛，然后登记了登记后一发生件事情。他父亲生病了，然后需要钱，然后他告诉我，他当时因为我也刚毕业，没有没自己多收入。OK然后呢，我就感觉有点恐惧，就感觉一种啊掉落好害怕OK。

 let's have a translation。 And he said I give give all the time after we。

Became formally married one day her father got sick and she asked me ask money from me。

 but I just graduated without much money。Okay， all right， I understand。Okay。

 but what would be realistic give me a realistic picture how it could look I mean you have two kids。

Your wife has to look after the two kids and you also can have boundaries。

 You can tell her I'm not going to look after your father。 That's not what I want to do。

 You can have boundaries。那我们现在一起来想一想一些具体的切实可行的方法哈，就是你需要怎样的这个婚姻有怎样的改变，或者满足你怎样的需求，你才会更快乐。你们有两个孩子了，已经。

那当然你也可以划清一个界限。就是说我可以照顾你，但是我不想照顾你的爸爸等等。你去想一想你具体的需求是什么？呃，这个我去做了，然后呢，具体的需求我觉得没有没有办法满足。因我觉得。I think my。

Actually， my knees cannot be met。继续说 but we don't know what your needs are all we know is that you are resentful because you feel that you give so much what are your needs have no你求是什么因为感觉到你内心是觉得一直在给予的这种愤恨那你可以说说你求 what you pissed off about but youre not saying what you need始选。

就就是那个没有特别喜欢，就是没有认真对待过一段关系，就是很很草率的就找了一个女朋友，然后随着父母催婚然后就结婚了。当然他对我挺好。这么多也非常有感情。

但呢参加工作以碰到了一个就是喜欢然后在心里放了有好多年吧，然后准备辞职的时候，我想告诉他一声结果这个女关注我很多就是相互喜欢很多 I think my niece is impossible to be met because dont because the day that we met meeting my wife that I didn't feel she was the one that I was attracted to after working。

 I met someone I really， really like the day when I hand over my resignation。😊，う。

I expressed my feelings to her。 And it turns out she shares the same feeling with me。 Oh。

 I understand now， Okay， well， that's very clear。 The problem is not with your wife。

 The problem is with you。呃，我现在非常理解你了，但是问题不在于你太太在于你自己的身上啊。对谢我我我两。😊。

What do we do in a situation you married with the woman that you don't totally love and there's a woman that you do want and you really do feel attracted to that is a really difficult situation你娶了一个自己不爱的女人。

但是你爱的女人他又不能够跟你在一起这种就说现在也可以但是因为双方都有家里。哎，这事就难了啊，然后呢，跟他在一块的时候就感觉世界特别好啊，能感觉到那些东西。但是呢我跟我现在的妻子呢。

那这么多呢这么多年的感情，还有两个孩子，哎，我也不知道该怎么办啊，确实好难熬的 actually， she is willing to be together with me too。

 but both of us have a family of right。 I'm so sorry to hear that， you know。😊。

You're actually a wonderful man and I feel you being very。

 very honest and it's a difficult thing to talk about。呃，我觉得你是一个特别特别真诚的男人，这些东西其实是很难聊出来的，很难就是这样去表达的。

InI don't know what you could do in this situation it's very very difficult I don't really know and'm not i'm not feeling that I can guide you clearly here。

呃，我不知道这样的情况该怎么办，我感觉自己好像也没有办法能够给你一个清晰的职业。But it's important to say the problem is not my wife。

 the problem is me， I did not make the good choice。This is my parents嗯，在这里呢重要的是你要清楚啊，问题不是我的太太。

而是我自己是因为我没有做好选择，我听了父母的建议。对。你没有好办法是 so you don't have a solution to me no it's very complicated you know when there's two families it's really difficult and honestly what I would say is you should all sit down and talk to each other you should talk to your wife your wife knows。

She maybe doesn't know intellectually but she knows and I think you have to talk about it我想说啊这个局面非常的困难。

因为他涉及到两个家庭，但是重要的是你一定要跟你的太太好好的聊一聊，我相信他一定是他一定是有感觉的，他虽然可能不是非常清晰，究竟发生了什么，但是他一定有感觉，所以你要跟他聊出来啊，对方已经离婚，然后呢。

我太太也知道了，要跟我离婚，虽然领了离婚证了，但是这个以前的模式还在。啊，是离已经离婚了是吧，对方已经离婚了嗯，你还你还没有是吗？啊，我我因因为被我对象知道以后。

那个但是没有什没有没有还没有越过道德边迁啊，然后呢但是已经精神已经受不了，无法控制情感了。嗯，就是你的太太知道了是吧？我的太太也知道了，然后要跟我离婚，然后呢快签了，但是呢虽然签了那个模式性的东西。

但是我们的所有的所有的东西没有改变。Actually， the girl that I like， she's already divorced and my wife has already knew has known about it and she is out of control being really emotional and she wants to divorce with me without the paper but we didn't okay。

 I think you need some help， I think you need to find a good person to discuss it with to make sure that the children are safe and this transition is well handled。

我觉得你需 very careful here because the children你需要一个专业的人来支持你啊去做一个过渡。这个这里非常重要的是不能够让孩子受到影响。

 terms in terms of your needs。 you very clear。've said it very honestly。

 and I really appreciate that。 thank you提到你的这份需求呢实际上你自己非常的清楚而且你也非常真诚的表达出来了。

关于这点我非常的欣赏你 thank you for your sharing it was really great感谢你的分享特别的好 let's do a break when we come back in 15 minutes we'll do some dancing and then I'll do a demo。

 So maybe we make it， we look at well， what's going on， what are your needs and。

What can we understand about that maybe has to do with a family of origin。

 maybe not maybe it's something else， so I invite you to share with me whatever you want to share。

那我们的主题呢是需求与界限。那我可以我想鼓励你们呢去聊一聊自己的需求。那这个需求可以是关于原生家庭的，也可以是与之无关的。所以我鼓励你去分享所有你想分享的一切。Yeah。嗯，那我来说吧。啊。

我们结婚7年，然后呃发生性关系的次数不超过10次。呃，我老公在这方面是有比较大的心理障碍，他一直说他没有欲望。呃，然后我们呃做爱的时候，他会属于一个小孩子的状态，就是碰他他就为有了痒。

然后呃我是比较勇猛的，所以呢。我以前就会就是会这样，然后我后来我们开我们花了我们已经在这件事情上花了5年时间去做各种疗愈咨询。

然后我慢慢知道原很猛的他强要你翻译吧感觉信息 think you've lot energy weve been married for seven years already had sex for about1 times during those years。

😊，HeMy husband， he always shared with me that he doesn't have any sexual desires and when we are in bed having sex。

 I'm the kind of fierce type while he's rather shy and he would say， oh。

 I feel so tickling when you touch me and we've been through many therapies within five years。

And then I found out that when I'm really fierce and he is afraid to be violated。Yeah。Yeah， okay。

 I mean your energy is beautiful and I'm sure even your husband can see that you are a beautiful alive woman right我觉得你的能量非常的好非常的美我相信你的先生应该也能看到你有一股鲜活的生命力 before you marry。

 did you ever talk about sex did you ever think about are we compatible。在你们结婚之前有没有聊过关于性的东西。

会嗯会想到两个人是否在这方面是适合的吗？其实结婚之前我就知道他有这方面的障碍，我犹豫过，但最终还是结婚了。然后这里就要提到我这三天在上课的时候，我发现我其实在重复我母亲的模式。

AndI hesitated before marriage because I knew that he had such an obstacle in sex and during the learning process I found out I'm been repeating my mother's pattern就是我的爸爸是出轨的。

在我十多岁的时候，而且很严重的是她是我妈妈出差回来，然后捉奸在床，而且我妈在我大学的时候跟我描述这件事情描述的非常细节，所以我知道他们这件事情的很多细节对我来说太太over了。

because my father had an affair when I was你是岁的时候爸爸有外 my father had an affair when I was about 15 years old。

 My mother caught them in bed。 And then she described to me in great details and I think I knew too much about that in that age Youre right。

 You're absolutely right。 But you see your sexuality is also healthy。 There's nothing wrong with it。

 really但到还有性能状常健康。And also not with your husband， it's just。You're not in balance sexually。嗯。

只不过两个人在性能量这里啊稍微有一点失衡而已。So let's hear a bit from the man。

 What would you like to tell me what's important for you好，我想听听这位男士，你觉得你想对我说的是什么？对你来说重要的是什么？好。

我先描述一下情况哈。嗯，首先从这个课堂里，我能现在感觉到这三天的课之后，我能感觉到其实我在面对性的时候，我是一个充分呃小孩子的状态，我是会觉得非常的羞耻。甚至于是害怕的嗯。

In the three days class， I feel I'm like a child relating to sex， I feel shameful， even fearful。

That's so beautiful that's so beautiful that's very honest and I think that you're saying the truth did something happen in your family that had helped you to feel this way about sex can you tell me something非常的真诚啊我想了解一下你的家庭当中有没有发生过一些事情让你有这样的感觉。

嗯，好的，嗯，我的原生家庭就是我爸爸妈妈表面表面看上去是非常和谐的，但是在我的原生家庭中是没有任何的关于性方面的信息爸不要说了在我面前连亲甚至于肢体接触都是没有的。

所以我其实原来对于婚姻的理解是两个人搭伙过日子就是没有性别的感觉。原家庭 in family ofrring is rarely any information about sex my parents they didn't have any physical contact intimate behaviors interactions so my concept of marriage was two people in partnership in life that's so great that know that right right。

じ？If the parents don't give the child any guidance about sex then the child has no healthy relationship to their body or to sex确实是这样如果父母他没有给孩子任何关于性的引导的话那孩子他会对这方面非常的不了解无论是身体上的还是行行为上的 because it really is the job of the parents to guide the child about sexuality otherwise we have no support and no education。

父母应该去引导孩子关于性的一切，否则的话我们会对此一无所知。 And when we don't have that。

 we don't know how to develop in a healthy way， either as a man or as a woman。这样的话，无论我们是男生还是女生。

我们都不知道如何健康的去发展自己这方面的能力。 and both of you had difficulty in your family， the lady。

 your father was hypersexual， He was more sexual， right， and that is also difficult to manage so。

So you have the opposites one is hypersex and the other is non sexualual and then you don't know how to meet么在这位女性的原生家庭当中呢她的父亲是这种性能量过度活跃的状态而这位男士的家庭当中呢好像有一点是没有任何性能量的一个状态所以这就造成了一种失衡 So in a way。

 both of you have some kind of shame about sex。And you just have different ways to actually express that。

所以你们都是对性有一种羞耻感，只不过表达的形式不太一样 the time don't feel desire wonderful I'm glad you're so open about it and honest。

 That's one way to come out of shame实际性渴一件特好的事样也一个走出羞耻感 you a fantasy like about because you are a man。

 You're not a。好，那现在呢让我们先啊聊聊你自己啊。嗯，你有没有关于性的一些幻想，或者觉得自己在性爱当中应该是怎样的状态。 and maybe the pressure。

 the expectation from your wife is is is a lot for you to manage。 So okay， we get that。

也许来自于你太太会有一些压力让你去难以应付，我们也能够去了解这个部分。 But on the other hand， sometimes you might think about， oh。

 I'm also somehow interested in sex， but I want to do it in my way， something like that。有没有是这样的可能？

你会觉得我其实对性也是非常感兴趣的。只不过我想以自己的那种性爱的方式来进行。 So what can you tell me about your interest in sex。

 it doesn't even have to be about your wife， It's just about you， your interest in sex。

 your fantasies about sex。 What what does it look like for you那你是否愿意跟我们分享一下，你觉得你感兴趣的性爱方式是怎么样？

他也许跟你的太太毫无关系都可以。嗯，好的，呃，我是会有呃性幻想的，就是是会有的。但是我发现一旦开始进入到性幻想的画面，我会有极强的评判和羞耻，我会觉得我是罪恶的，我在犯罪，然后我在做一件非常不好的事情。

Actually， I have sexual fantasies， but I feel extremely shameful and judgmental once I have that picture。

 I feel really guilty about it。😊，No need， no need you came from a family that had a lot of sexual shame。

你是你不过是成长在你不过是长在一个对性有很多羞耻感的家庭里。但是这是你的原生家庭的产物，它不属于你，请把这个留给他们。

 and I'm really happy that you have your own sexual fantasies because that means you have a sexual life。

我非常的开心，你有新幻想啊，这说明你有自己的性生活是很好的。😊，And I think you don't have to tell us it's private。

 you tell your wife， here， I want to tell you some of my fantasies。

 I want to just put it out there because I don't want to carry that shame anymore。那你可以呢跟自己的太太说。

我是有性幻想的。我的性幻想是这样这样的，你不需要在这里告诉我们，因为你不需要再携带着那一份羞耻感。😊，So I think that's great news。

 so I like you to say to you what， I have my own sexual fantasyies sometimes just own it。

所以你需要完全的去啊大胆的去拥抱自己的这份幻想，跟自己的太太分享。我有这样的幻想告诉他， don't I don't want to say it in front of so many people。

 This is private。 But you tell， I have sexual fanta。 I am a sexual man， but it's my way。 you know。

 really make that boundary， make that boundary。我们在这里就不要公开的说了，但你可以跟你的太太说，我是一个很有性誉的男人，我只不过有自己想做爱的方式。

你可以告诉他。告诉他。Now to tell yes no no， he doesn't have to say what they are， that's private。

 but he can say that he does have that because that's his sexual life。 He has a sexual life。

你把刚才的这个陈述告诉他，你不用说下面的。It is a sexual life， it is your sexual life， it's a fantasy。

 but it's not nothing wrong虽然它是一个画面，一个幻想，但是它就是你的真实的性生活，没有任何错误，你跟他讲这句话。然后我有我的新幻想的。场景。我是有心意的。嗯。

And I'd like you to tell him， I'm happy to hear that。很高兴听到你说这个我也很希望你是很有幸。😊。

She said I'm happy to hear that and I hope that is true that you have desires I think he does I think he's telling you that he does。

 but he has to do it， he has to feel safe and fight his own style， his own way to express it。😊。

那我觉得他是有的，而且只不过他需要感受到安全，用他自己的方式来表达这份欲望。 I think you cannot underestimate how shaming it is to come from a family that never talks about sex。

 It's a sex negative approach and it's shaming。 It makes you feel ashamed。

 you don't even know why他成长在这样一个充满对爱充满着对性爱充满着羞耻感的家庭，千万不要低估这个原生家庭对他的印象。You know。

 and part of the issue is you have to say in your own way to your parents and I don't mean go to their house and said that internally。

 mother， father， I am a sexual person， even if you aren't。那么请这位男士在自己的内在找到一种方式对自己的父母说啊，说我是一个很很有性能量的。

而且很性感的男人。即便你们两个不是，但是我却是这样的，我并没有说在父母的家面对面的对他们说，但是你需要在内在完成这个过程。

There's two places to heal it one is to take it back to your family and say you know what。

 it wasn't good for me that you never talked about sex， it was horrible for me。

 it was shameful to me。有两种去疗愈他的方式，一种呢是追溯到自己的原生家庭，告诉他们，你们从来不聊性爱的事情。这一切对我来说都是非常羞耻感。

It's not about being angry with your parents because they were doing the best they could。

 they had no education， but it's about you saying I don't agree with that。但是我们不想把这份愤怒加注于自己的父母身上。

因为他们并没有得到足够多的资源和教育，他们已经尽力了。只不过我们一定要说嗯，我们一定要告诉他们我们自己的态度。你们所做的一切在我这里是不认同的。O。You know。

 I noticed between you is a nice connection， you actually have a very nice connection。

 you're actually really good friends。我注意到你们两个人之间的连接是非常好的，there may not be sex between you。

 but there is love， you know，即便是没有性，但是也有爱，你们是很好的朋友。

So I want you to talk about sex because you didn't in the family。

 so the first thing you have to do don't try to do it now is it's a bit you have to go slow。

 but talk about it， laugh about it， be playful about it。那现在呢我觉得你们两个当务之急，并不是说要去做爱呀，这有一点快，你们可以慢慢的来。

可以先聊一聊，可以先开开玩笑。You know， both you both carry a little bit of wound about sex。

 the father was a betrayer and your family was non sexual， I mean you don't even know how you came。

 maybe you were brought by the stalk or something， you know， like that's how crazy it is。嗯。

那你们两个人的家庭是非常有意思的。你的父亲呢，他是一个出轨者，但是在这位男士的家庭当中呢，没有性爱，所以你都不知道你是从哪来的，从哪生出来的，可能是捡来的。 reallyally。

 you have to tell youber， did I come from the store。😊，你可以 get你可以问问你的父母说我是哪里来的，是库存来的吗？我怎么来到这个世界上呢？😊。

我爸妈。What did they tell you？是捡来的吗？对，是捡来的对，每次都是告诉我我是捡来的，然后会告诉我什么，甚至会告诉我你爸爸妈妈在北京啊，你你长大了可以去找他们。对。

就是他们会非常避讳谈性爱和我是如何出来的，但现在又很逼我们生孩子。听到就他跟他爸已经吵架了，对是前几天刚跟我爸吵了一架。

They would tell me that they picked me up somewhere and。They will tell me， I mean。

 that is really unbelievable， like you weren't going to figure it out somehow。

 and they will tell me my real parents are in Beijing。😊。

AndThat's really strange now when do you feel anxious？fact and you know that's rubbish。

 don't you你知道他们在胡言乱语哈怪不得你稍微会有点焦虑 And the woman said the parents also urged him to urge them to have a baby now and the man even had a fight with a father。

I get it， you had authoritarian parents very demanding， you know。

It's you are very sensitive and you have to find your own path in life。

 not pressure from your parents， pressure from your wife， say to everybody。

 leave me alone and I find my own style。我明白你的父母是非常权威式的。那么这个时候呢，你就需要去看见自己的道路，一定要坚定走自己的道路，去放下别人给你所有的压力。

包括太太的父母的，一定要说让我自己一个人去走我想走的路。Now I don't I think you are attracted to your wife。

 but you need to find your own style to be with her that's the main thing I see you need to take control sometimes。

我觉得实际上你是能够感觉到你的太太是吸引你的，只不过你可能需要用自己的风格去完成这个过程。So I have some ideas for you。

I really want you to tell your wife your fantasies and have fun， enjoy it be crazy我有一些灵感我有些灵感。

你一定要跟你的太太去描述一下你的新幻想，两个人一起玩，一起进去，一起放肆的去享受。By talking about your fantasies。

 by showing your imagination， you take control of your sexuality again。 It's very important。

因为当你能够正式和表达想你就能够再一次去掌控自己的性性能量新生活。 so thats from your wife are really juicy really alive beautiful's nothing wrong fantastic给你的这个部分说完了。

现在说你的太太，你真的是非常的漂亮，非常的性感。太有魅力了， but you could ask him。

Is there anything that we could do that you enjoy， what can we do that you also like？

你可以去问问他有没有什么我们能一起做，却又让你享受的这种方式呢？You have to tune to him you have to。Also be very sensitive to him。

 you know， give him attention， ask him， what is it that you like？你需要去调频到跟他通频，去极度敏感的去感受他。你喜欢的是怎样的。

Because there's love between you this this I can see a connection， you love each other。

 you you really have something beautiful， so slowly slowly you can find a way to be intimate。

 have intimate connection that fits to both of you因为你们两个人之间是有深度的连接和爱的，你们可以逐渐的找到一种方式都适合两个人。😊，但我有问题。

就是就是因为我妈妈会跟我说，为什么我爸会出轨，是因为那个女人很擅长性爱，然后她造成了对我的很大的创伤，是我第一觉得哦，我在性上面是要取悦男人的，否则这个男人就会出轨。

但另外一方面我妈又散发着那种她是贞洁烈女，她多么的正，她多么的纯洁。所以我又觉得当我有欲望。当我有很多幻想的时候，我会觉得自己很脏，所以我觉得我。很难去表达自己的欲望。

Actually I caughts in a dilemma where my mother told me the affair person was really good at sex。

 then the information I learned was that in order to keep the intimacy I need to please man but secondarily my mom insists that she is really pure she is the pure woman pure goddess So that leads to to the pain that whenever I have many fantasies I judge myself I so your mother wasn't right and she made you split between the good girl and the bad z zoo。

But deep down， you know that that's rubbish in the same way that your husband knows that he didn't come from Beijing。

但是在你深深的地方，你知道你母亲说的这一些都是胡言乱语，就像你的先生知道他不是北京捡来的一样。te me what was your mother's motivation to tell you all this because it really crossed your boundaries。

 It was so invasive， so disrespectful to you。 Why what was her motive to do that。

你的母亲所做的这一些实际上是非常超越界限的对你非常大的侵犯。那我想请你告诉我，你母亲之所以这样做这样说，他背后的意图是什么？他就是想让我。帮他，因为我爸不光出轨，他还家暴，所以他觉得他孤立无人。

他想把我拉到他的这里。所以我从小很恨我爸，但是我长大发现不是这样的。Because she wanted my help she suffers from not only betrayal but also domestic violence from my father so she felt she was isolated she wanted me to side with her that's right she wanted you to side with her right you know you can have compassion for her but not side with her see she crossed your boundaries so strongly。

是的，他想让你站在他的阵营。那你当然可以对他抱有同情心、慈悲心，但是你不能够去跟他站在同一个阵营啊，因为他非常严重的侵犯了你的界限。So you have to say， mother。

 I care about you， but I have my own understanding about intimacy and men。 that's yours。

 That's not mine。 That's your life。 It's not mine。 And you tell her that I have compassion for you。

 I know it was sadly， but that's your thing， not mine。 That's boundaries。 That's belongs to you。

 It does not belong to me。所以你是否能告诉你的母亲妈妈，我非常的在乎你，但是发生在你身上的是你的故事。我对于性爱，对于亲密关系和男人有不同的看法，这是你的，不是我的。

Because you have to say I'm sexual and pure at the same time。

 I'm not sexual or pure because that's not true。你要告诉他我既性感又纯洁是性感了就不纯洁了，纯洁了就不性感的。

我是两者兼有的 takes a lot of courage your mother kind of daughter are together这需要非常大的勇气。因为当你这样说的时候。

你的母亲可能会说哦天哪，我生了怎样的女儿。但是这就是事实你是既性感又纯洁的。What your mother did was understandable。

 but it wasn't kind to you。因为母亲所做的一些，虽然虽然能够理解，但是他对你来说是不好的。也不公平。

so I want you to look at your husband and sayI'm sexual and请看见你的丈夫告诉他，我很性感，我也很纯洁，我很性感，我也很纯洁，好拜。Yeah。

 she is a teller。Yes， you see， you have to tell her that her sexuality is beautiful。

 that you see it and it's beautiful， she needs to feel that from you你要告诉她你很性感我很喜欢你的性能量。

can you do that？我很喜欢你的信名啊，真的。你是生命力啊。You're full of vibrant energy， you're alive。

And beautiful and pure Teller and pure告诉他，而且你还很纯洁，而且你还很纯洁。

But you can see that both of you had your boundaries。Influenced by your family about their。

Sexual difficulties， they imposed it。On YouTube and you have to say， no， that belongs to you。

 we find our own way。你们需要去建立起属于自己的关于性爱的界限，不要再被自己原生家庭的这一份性爱的羞耻感所影响。And I think if you can go into sex。

 very gentle， very delicate， not shocking， not overexted。

 you two can really find a beautiful way to meet each other because sex is important let's admit it。

 it's an important part of intimacy。我觉得如果你们两个能够以一种非常温柔，非常体恤的方式进入到性爱，你们一定能找到一个适合彼此的性爱方式。不要以那种太过于凶猛。

太过于兴奋的方式啊， leave parents out。 don't bring them in the bedroom。 Leave them in the living room。

把你们的父母都放在客厅，不要带他们进你们的卧室床上那个外的第三者呀，是仓库里捡来的呀，或者是北京这些一切的故事都放在卧室的外面。Your mother's shame。

 your mother's shame， it's not your shame and you guys have a chance you should really stay together and find a way because you love each other and this love what you have is very special it's very beautiful we all can feel it。

你的母亲有他的羞耻，而你的母亲也有他的羞耻，这是他们的羞耻，不是你们的，把这些留给他们，你们有一份希望能够找到属于两个人的性爱。

 And I think the door for you is to express your fantasies because that will open you up。

 You have a lot of sexual imagination。你们两个人之间的这一份感情非常的特别，这份爱非常的特别，我们都能看到。所以你需要去打开两个人的幻想，去享受他，不需要去害怕。

😊，他是一个非常有活力的女人，你不需要去害怕。Sexual and pure。goes together即性感瞬经。这两者是相辅相成的，只不过你的母亲分裂了你。All right。

 anything more you want to say I think you guys are wonderful I'm so happy to meet you还有什么要说的吗？

我觉得你们两个简直是太让我喜欢了。😊，我非常开心遇见你。😊，And I tell you something else everybody had。😊。

Messages from the family about sex that were confusing。

 that were negative that were scary we all had that you know really scary stuff。

And we have to put it to the side。每个人都在原型家庭当中获取到那些关于性爱的一些负面的东西，羞耻感的，非常恐怖的等等。但是这些我们都需要放在一边。

sweetAnd just give each other a hug lets see love between the man and让我们看看男人女人之间的爱。😊，嗯。

How do you feel now， yes， do you feel better感觉更好一点了吗？Yes。😊，thank you very much。youre welcome。

我觉得沙兰老师的点都抓的特别精准嗯。就是每一句话都很有能量。然后觉得我。What is both sexual and pure Yeah。

 I'm pure and sexual I'm pure and because you better say this was this she was pure the other woman was sexual and you like a work I I think she said Sharon I feel that you're always right to the points every sentence from you is a full of energy and。

嗯，山老师刚才说说是的，呃，你的妈妈她觉得自己是纯净的那个女人是性感的那你就会觉得啊，那我到底是要纯净还是性感呢？And。

 and she also said I feel that I'm both sexual and pure， you pure， youre wonderful。

Yeah don't hurt your sexuality， it's really such a beautiful part of you。是的，你确实非常的纯净，但你也不要去降低自己的性能量。

都是非常美好的。 you're lucky to have herhe's great you're lucky to have him。 you guys stay together你能够遇见他。

你非常的幸运。这位男子。那么你有他作为你的丈夫，你也非常的幸运，你们一定要承诺两个人在一起，you can heal together。你们能够一起完成这份疗愈。Thank you。

 Thank you。thank you ，谢谢ok。😊，They was so sweeter。😊，那刚才非常的感人。😊，Okay。No， I have。Okay。

 so I have some questions can I have gallery view again that I can see people。我看一下画廊模式可以进入答疑环节了。

a question you touched by that your一个问题，刚才被感动的请举手。Yeah。嗯。And it's so important to heal our shame。

 to accept our sexuality， all of us， men and women。由于自己的羞耻感去接纳性能量，是我们每一个人要做的事情。无论男女。

There's nothing that we have to be ashamed of， even if we got strange messages from our family。

 that's their problem， not ours。没有任何东西是需要修耻的。即便我们从原生家庭当中获取了如此多奇怪的讯息，但是这属于他们，不是我们的。

I really hope you can take that into your heart that sexuality is such an important part of a relationship。

 an important part of intimacy， and we can like just push it to the side。我非常希望大家能够真心的吸纳进这个学系。

性能量或者性赖非常的重要。它是亲密关系不可缺少的一部分。我们不能够把它放到一边置之不理。Okay， great。

 so I'm going to just go quickly through some of these questions and then we'll have like some time for you you people to share with me or ask questions or something。

好，我们就快一点的去回答一下我收到的问题。等一下呢就现场选一些问题啊。 So the first question is about shame and all I want to say is when you can see what your shame is。

 you can start to heal it。 So it's important to to try to understand what is my shame。

How does it feel呃，第一个问题呢是关于羞耻感的。我想说的是，一旦你能够看见你的羞耻感，你就能去疗愈它。所以非常重要的是，你要看到你的羞耻感是什么。

And where did it come from who gave it to me because I was not born with it。

 So there is a lot of work to do with shame， maybe one day I do a whole piece on shame because it's such an important piece of work对你也需要去看到他来自于哪里。

谁给了我张羞耻的信息，因为你绝对不是与生俱来就拥有它的这羞耻感非常的重要，也许有一天我可能会专门开一个以羞耻感为主题的工作坊。Okay here's a very interesting one。

 my husband is forgiving and accepts me， but sometimes I have a rage against him and I also feel distant。

And physical rejection。What do I do to change the situation这样这样一个这样一个有意思的问题啊，就是我的先生呢，他是对我非常宽容也非常接纳的。

但是我总会对他有一种愤怒，还有一种距离感，那该怎么办？Well sometimes when the rage comes up。

 it's really interesting to ask yourself， who am I really angry with， is it my father。

 is it my mother？What is this anger， Try to understand it。当愤怒来临的时候，我们需要去感受一下我们究竟愤怒的对象是谁，是对父亲、母亲吗？

这个我们生气的东西到底是什么？And when I read your question， I have a feeling that you're not saying your needs。

 your rage comes from not expressing your needs。那当我在读你的这个问题的时候，我有一种感觉我觉得你是没有表达自己的需求。所以你的这个愤怒来自于你的需求。

没有被看见。Maybe you have needs， but you want your husband to find out what they are and you get angry with him if he doesn't get it right。

也许你有一份需求，希望被你的丈夫看见。当你的丈夫不理解的时候，你就会对他有这种愤怒。So you have to look， am I saying my needs。

 what are my needs， do I take a risk with him？所以你需要去看一下，我表达了我的需求吗？我的需求是什么？

Because when we have anger it's usually because we're frustrated in our needs that's what anger is we're not getting what we need一般来说当我们有愤怒的时候。

我们总是会有一种挫败，也就是自己的需求没有被表达没有看见。Okay。So。Somebody says I'm the dependent， my husband is the antidepend。

 how do I deal with my husband's repression and denial？那有一个人说我是依赖者，我的丈夫是反依赖者，我如何去面对我丈夫的忽视和拒绝？Okay。

 this is a great question because so often we get caught independent。

 antidepend and what the dependent must do is to be more self sufficient。

 to be more to be less demanding， less needy of the partner。很多时候我们都卡在这样一个呃依赖者和反依赖者的格局里面。

那对于一个依赖者需要做的是，我们要能够去照料自己的需求，要在需求上尽量的自给自足。 We have to see that。Our dependences can create。

Difficulties for the other person， so we have to。Build ourselves up internally， find our strength。

 find our happiness and not。Ask so much from apo。那这个时候我们需要去看到自己的这份依赖，会给其他人带来非常多的压力和痛苦。

这个时候呢我们需要去成长自己内在的力量，去找到属于自己的幸福，满足自己的需求，而并不是说依赖于他人来满足自己。😊。

And the other part is to ask your husband what do they need in the marriage。

 what do they want from you or what do they want from the marriage and you have to discuss it and see what's possible between you那么另一个你需要做的就是去问一问你的先生他的需求是什么。

从你的身上以及婚姻上他究竟需要的是什么，并且去聊一聊你们两个人之间有哪些新的可能性。And somebody said， how do I be an adult in a relationship。

 well and it's what I said it's tension。Its affection。

 its appreciation and being honest about your needs。那么有一个人说我怎么样才能婚姻，在婚姻当中快乐啊，那就是我之前讲过的这三点。首先是给予你的关注。

给予你的好感，以及给予你的欣赏以及感恩。那另外一个非常重要的是要非常真诚的表达自己的需求。There's another question。

 when I start a new relationship what should I know about my partner's romantic history？

What if this triggers their wounds， what should I do about it？That's good。

 I don't think you need to know all the details about people they've loved before you。

I don't think it's so necessary。有一个朋友问啊，说当我在拍写一段关系的时候，是不是需要了解他所有的浪漫史呢？那如果这触发了我的一些伤痛该怎么办？

那山老师回答就是我觉得你不需要去了解他的过去，这个不是必要的。Because if we're an insecure person。

And we compare ourselves to people from their past。It could bring up a lot of shame and insecurity。

因为如果我们本身就是缺乏安全感的，我们又会把自己拿来跟他过去的这些对象比较的时候，我们就很可能会升起非常多的这种不安全感，还有羞耻感。

And it's really not necessary to know it's， you know， everybody is allowed to be private。

那知道这些呢实际上并不是非常必要的，因为每一个人都有权利保有他们的隐私。And private is different than secret。

 Secret is when you hide something that's and you're cheating。

 that's not what I'm saying private is that。We don't we're allowed to have a private life and a private inner life that。

We don't always have to tell it's okay to have some things that are not spoken。那么我想说啊，这隐私呢跟秘密又是不一样的。

我们所说的秘密是我们企图去隐瞒一些东西，但是隐私呢仅仅是属于自己的私密空间，我们每一个人都有权利保有自己内在的私密的生活还有自己私密的空间。 And by and by。

 as you get more secure with each other and more confident you might want to say some things about your past。

 but not in the beginning in the beginning， it's very delicate when two people are meeting and creating safety。

那当两个人开始慢慢的相处，建立更加深厚的信任以及安全感之后，你可能会自然的想分享一些关于过去的历史，这是可以的。但是不要在一开始感情还非常的脆弱的时候去造成太多的不安全感。

 So here's another good question。 Both me and my partner have had affairs and made mistakes。

这里很有意思的问题，就是说我和我的伴侣都有过外遇，都犯过错误。But now we want to come back to the family and repair our relationship。

现在我们都想回归家庭来修复我们的关系。But we both still feel insecure。And trustless about each other。但是我们都对彼此有不安全感。

也缺少信任。Is there anything we can do to build our relationship， Yes， there is，我们能做些什么来建立新的关系？有的。

In a situation like this， if you want to heal， you have to be very honest with each other。在这样的情况下。

如想疗愈和修复的话，你们两个都要对彼此极度的真诚。And not so much about what happened。

 but why but about why did I have this affair， why did I betray our relationship。

 what was it这个城市可能并不指的是你发生外遇的这些细节，而是你为什么会有外遇，为什么会建立这个外面的这段关系？

If you can really talk honestly about that， that is the repair。如果你能非常真诚的非常诚实的去聊一聊这一点，修复就已经开始了。

 And the other thing is you have to really end those affairs and have no contact。

 You can't repair a relationship and still。Have an affair doesn't look。那另一点呢，就是你需要完全断掉这些外遇的关系。

不需不可不可以有任何的连系啊，否则的话你不能够一边修复，一边有外遇的。 If you still want to have the affair and come back to the relationship。

 it's very confusing。如果一个人一边想有外遇，一边想回归这段关系，那是非常混乱的。

That's a great question for someone who is 60 years old does an intimate relationship still matter yes it does那有一个问题非常有意思就是对于1个60岁的人来说亲密关系还重要吗？

是的非常重要。I want to say you are never too old for love。我想说法。我想说爱永远都不会太晚。And if you open。

 you never know when it can happen， it can happen any moment that you meet someone。如果你能够敞开自己的话。

你永远无法期待有什无法预料有什么会发生，每一刻都有可能发生。Okay， the last one life was about family， I don't want to do it。

It's about when you're you're。Your husband's parents or your wife's parents interfere with your family。

 so this is an issue about boundaries。那么最后一个问题是关于家庭的，这个是关于呃男方的父母或者女方的父母去干扰了他们的家庭。那么这个是关于一个界限的议题。

And I think it's really important if the family wants to create a strong family。

 they have to put boundaries to the parents。Otherwise， it's boundaryness。若果我们想要去建造一个非常和谐稳定的家庭。

我们就需要跟自己原生家庭的父母划清这样的界限。I will say a lot more about boundaries and families in the next group。

Which we've already talked about in October。那么在10月份的这个课程上呢，我将会着重的深入给大家讲解一下界限和家庭的部分。

That's when we're going to talk about boundaries， families。

How do you create a strong love relationship you have to have boundaries with the parents you have to I know it's hard but you have to到时候呢会给大家讲讲如何拥有一段非常稳定的非常稳固的这样爱的关系啊那么有一个前提就是我们需要跟原生家庭划行期限不受干扰 once you get into a marriage your parents cannot control your life if they still try to control your life youre just a child。

当你进入一段婚姻之后，你的原生家庭的父母就无法再去控制你的生活了。如果你仍被控制，那么说明你仍然是个孩子。

But I want to talk about that in October I don't want to do that now， so I will now open it up。

 we've got 20 minutes or so for your questions。 So if anybody wants to ask something。

 you just have to。那么10月份的时候我们在谈论这个话题呢，现在呢打开空间给大家提问，请田园帮我们组织一下。so we ask Aliceice to come on。 Yeah。

 Aliceice， please give me some people to talk to。好。

请天 I like your questions short Otherwise it too long I not so much time now那请大家把自己的问题说的精简一点。

这样的话时间我们就不够否则的话时间不够用的。嗯，好的，那我们请四班的郑长。Hi。HiHi Sharon， I'm George。呃，在你的课堂上。

我感受到充分聆听对方的需求和充分表达自己的需求是那么的美好。那我的问题是关于呃倾听和表达的部分。在倾听对方的需求的时候，每当我倾听到伴侣，关于他原生家庭的伤痛很重的伤痛的时候，我的身体很敏感。

就会有一些不舒服的反应在某些地方，然后在充分表达自己需求的部分。我有一些想法，比如说跟社会的价值观是不符合的时候，我不敢向我的伴侣去表达，我该如何来突破这两者。嗯，好的。😔。

欢迎 Sharon listening you listening。😊，I feel it's quite beautiful listening to others' needs and expressing our own needs and my question is did I have strong physical reactions listening to my wife's trauma in the family of originanging and I also feel difficult to open up to my wife if the values I'm holding is against is to the opposite to the common value of the society。

 what do I do？Well， the first thing is what is it about your wife's trauma that is difficult for you。

首先我想问的是你太太的创伤的哪一个部分让你感觉到身体上有那种反应 Where do you react？ what makes you react是哪个部分让你有反应呢？哦。嗯，请请就着打开一下。哎。

好的，现在结束静音了。呃，关于我太太对于原生家庭的忠诚度，然后呃在他的原生家庭里面，他的父母一直希望能够掌控他。其实他跟我已经结婚很多年了。

Their parents tried to control her， even though after many years of her marriage。

That's hard for you to see that。呃，对你来说这个非常的困难。看到这个情况是吗？是的，所以每一单提到呃提到办理的原形家庭的时候，然后跟他的呃跟岳父岳母相处的时候。

我的身体就会有一些不舒服的反应。So my body reacts in an uncomfortable way whenever we are together with their parents parents。

 Sure， because they boundary invade us， they're controlling。那肯定是因为他们是侵犯界限的人，他们也太控制了。It's difficult。

这个非常不容易 and your wife is caught。 she wants to protect her parents。 She wants to protect you。

 Shes in a difficult situation。 She wants to protect herself。 has a conflict是非常艰难的他一边想要保护父母，想要保护你。

还要保护自己，对他来说 have to compassion for very wants wants be parents cross domin这候你要理解你的他希望自的父母能开心，希望你开心。

It would be better if you could give her support because she's in a difficult situation。

 very difficult， I can imagine。如果你能支持他的话，这就非常的好。因为他的父母一直在跨越界线，我能够去想象他的困境。Now。

 would she allow you to give her parents some boundaries？他会允许你去面对他的父母划行界线吗？

Would she allow you to say to them？最ジね。对我的太太对我是允许的，他说我他的父母是他父母，其实他侵害到我们家庭，他允许我去做他做我自己。

所以我这边就是呃很多的时候我面对自己身体的反应，比如说腹部的反应不舒服，我该如何去处理呢？Yes， actually she allows me to be myself in front of her parents to steer clear the boundary。

 my question is how do I deal with my physical reactions when we are together？😊。

You express them without you express them。You don't have to keep them in。

 You express them就是表达出来你的感受 with respect， but you express them。

 you don't have to suppress yourself不需要去压抑自己，直接说我需要尊重。Yeah。是对对我呃的岳父岳母说。

还是对我太太说可 my wife to parents to the parents to the。对你的太太说 it must trigger you about your own family know I don' want to do a whole work with you but must also with your family of origin that are not resolved因为你有这样的身体反应说明他触发了你自己原家庭的一些东西所以你也有类似 musting your family story not just hers以不仅是他的故也是你的故事 it always comes back to what happened to me in my familyming in way。

所以最终呢我们都是要去追溯原生家庭究竟发生了什么才让我有这样的反应。so I leave you with that Georgeorgethan you for your great questions。

我就在这里啊结束我们之间的互动好吗？感谢你非常好的问题。Okay， all right， thanks， let's take one more。好的，那再来一个前二班的刘军花。系。嗯，夏兰老师好。

太吓人嗯，我的心中啊一直有。可能啊我我的心中一直有恨和怒火都好几年了。嗯，但是呢好像这个都好几年了，一直都反正是有这个东西，但是就看不着。今天你讲以后，我发现我这是我心中这份恨和怒火。

有一部分是我家族家族的。因为我爸爸是一个被颂养的人，所以他也他心中有怒和恨。而我我说的奶奶和爷爷是我是我妈妈的父母。我爷爷呢？我爷爷家族也有恨。但是呢我奶奶是一个信佛的人。hi， Sharon。

 I realized I've been holding hatred and anger for many years and that comes from my family of Oranging because my father was adopted and my mother's family were having many hatred as well。

是。我奶奶是一个信佛的人，所以啊我们家族就有一个就说是恨的一个对立面和善良的一个对立面。这在我心中就是一个两。两两个极端。我爷爷的。父母。See。哦，我爷爷我爷爷的父亲。Okay。

 I need translation and I'm experiencing two opposite polarities in my family of arranging because my maternal we don't need the whole family history now。

I haven't got the space to take it， but I have to ask you。

 do you like to feel all that hatred or do you want to let it go？那，现在呢不需要太多的历史哈，我想问你的是，你希望留下这份憎恨。

还是希望放下这份憎恨？😊，我想放下to let it go。肯定我想把我父辈的恨还给他。You have to ask yourself。

 what does it give me to carry all that hatred， What does it give me，那你需要去问一下，我携带了这份憎恨这么多年，那我得到了什么？

携带的这份憎恨，我能获得怎样的好处？我才这样做的呢？Does it make you happy to carry all that hate？我好像有一种是不是想替他们完成一些遗愿的东西呢？

And she said maybe somehow I need to complete submission for them。Well。

You're just playing their game by carrying the same hatred that they had you have。

What mission are you completing except be belonging to that family with a lot of hatred。

 you have to say it's your hatred I don't want it。but you seem to want it，但是你携带的这一个憎恨这么多年一直让自己不快乐。

这仅仅是一个非常荒谬的游戏而已。你能够完成什么有意义的使命呢？这是属于他们的，你应该还给他们才行。嗯。但是我也就我也不知道我为什么就一直放不下这个东西。

I don't know why it's so difficult to let it go because it keeps you connected with the family。

 If you would let the hatred go， you would let the family go。因为这份憎恨让你感觉到跟自己原生家庭的连接。如果你要放下这份憎恨的话。

你就不得不要放下原生家庭。Native emotions are as powerful an attachment as positive emotions， if not more。

 So it's your way to stay connected， but it's a negative way。 It's not working。 not help。

负面情绪它跟我们正面的这些情绪啊，比如说幸福快乐一样的强大，它都是我们的执着。如果你要保持跟他们的连接，你就不得不去抓取这一份负面的东西去完成这份连接。我如果放下这份恨的话，那就等于等于我背叛了。

我的家背叛了我的父母，背叛了我的长辈。Letting go of that hatred equals to betrayal to my family。

Right so that's your choice if you want to stay with a family and you keep the hatred then you're connected with the family。

 but you're disconnected from your heart但是这是你自己的选择如果你想选择去要携带的这份憎恨，那么你就跟他们在一起，但是这个时候你却跟自己的心灵失去了连接。

You need to think about this deep and hard because if that's your choice， okay， it's your choice。

所以你需要深深的思考一下这个问题。如果这是你的选择的话，那就只能这样。Yes don't want to go on now I want to stop now because I don't want to go around in circles point is clear if you to the hatred you hold the family let of hatred also里你执份憎恨么也就执着的这份原生家庭如果你要放下憎恨。

你也需要去放下你的原生家庭已经常 hatred hatred这份憎恨你仍然可在放下憎恨的同时家这并不矛盾。Okay。Good luck。 about think about it。

's what's this for its for hatred好，祝你幸运。我希望你能够想好好去感受一下我们的人生并不需要浪费在憎恨上老师thank you有理解了I was inspired littleI'm glad think you啊非常开心我感觉你看出来。

😊，I'll take one more and then I'm going to talk about my next groups再一5班的初。Okay。Hi。Yes，你要自己看吗？Yes。

Yeah。还，有一个请求解除争议，你可以是吧？嗯。对，现在好了吗？可以听到了，请讲OK谢谢。嗯，我有一个嗯问题是嗯渴望被爱，但是我又很惧怕。嗯。呃，总是在躲藏。然后我觉得这个是来自于对原生家庭的忠诚。

我觉得接受被爱的话，就等于背叛了我的。嗯和我的原生家庭隔离了 Iming for love， but afraid at the same time。

 I feel it's a betrayal if accepted love to the family of连接自己，自己有力量，对，然后这个我得到原生家庭的很支持，我又不想放弃这份支持。

然后我又希望自己能够享受被爱的感觉。但是我总觉得在这个原生家庭的爱和这个夫妻关系的爱中间只能选一样感 feel to choose one between my own intimate love and love family ofrrangve been but familyrrang a want to let that go。

But it's not support if you can't express your love， what kind of support is security。

 but it's not support。原生家庭给你的这份知识，可能更多的像是一种安全感。如果你都不能够去表达自己的爱，接受自己的爱的话，那是他不是真正的支持。The best love。

 the best gift a parent can give a child is to help them find their own way in life。父母能够给孩子最好的支持。

最好的礼物是让一个孩子在生命当中找到属于自己的道路。As long as you stay hooked up in the family and you can't live your own emotional life。

 you stay a child。只要你还处在跟原生家庭的纠缠当中，无法去表达自己，那么你仍然是一个孩子。

It's a choice between being a child or being an adult do you want to grow up do you want to be a woman you want to be a girl想老师成为一个孩子呢还是说长大成人你想成为一个女人还是 the family makes you believe that you can't manage without them that's absolutely not true。

而你的原生家庭呢让你有一种错觉，好像是我没有办法独立的去面对自己的人生。但是事实不是如此。 and the family connection is strong。 You know。

 you love your parents。 They love you， but you have to not have this entanglement of this control。

那么原生家庭跟我们之间的联系是非常稳定的。只不过在这种稳定的关系当中，我们不需要过分的纠缠，不需要过分的控制。我还能说什么呢？What's happening？发什么什么。我有一个姐姐，她婚姻不幸福。

我觉得我的我如果幸福的话，我就会让她引起。他自己不好的感觉不会有罪恶感。One of my elder sisters is not happy in marriage。

 I feel my happiness and intimacy would trigger her。😔，My god， you so responsible for everybody else。

哦天哪，你是一个太有责任感的人了，天天想着别人 responsible for your sister。

 youre responsible for your parents what bet you想着姐姐，想着父母，那你呢你自己呢？😊，Unbelievable。

 you don't have to do that。My sister made her choices。It's not your fault。你的姐姐做了她的选择，不是你的错。You know。

 your being unhappy doesn't save anybody。你的不快乐，不会拯救任何人。你的不快乐，不会拯救你的家庭，你的父母，你的姐姐。In fact。

 your being happy saves everybody，而你的快乐才能够真正的救赎他人。I think you know that。我觉得你明白了。Thank you my teacher。

 you know， you've got so much life in you。😊，你知道吗？你内在有太强的生命力了。 You know， these family connections。

 they're so deep， but we really have to look at them honestly and say， are they helping me。

我们跟家族的连接非常的强大，但是我们需要非常真诚的去审视这一份连接。是不是他正在帮助我的成长。H。Okay。

I would think that your parents would love to see you happy。

 that would make any parent happy is to see their child happy。我觉得你的父母很希望看到你快乐，任何孩子的幸福都是父母想看见的。😊。

Don't you think， what do your parents？Don't like to see you happy。 What is it？你不觉得吗？还是你觉得你的父母不想看到你幸福。

到底是怎么回事？😔，Yeah。我觉得。Yes。我如果快乐了，我的姐姐，她就会。呃，有嫉妒，然后就会嗯。他就会觉得自己不够好，然后他就会是嗯引起他他很多情绪，这样我父母也会不快乐。

然后我的整个家庭都会不快乐啊，所以我我认为我我可以不快乐，然后。平静那就很好。I feel my sister would be jealous and emotional seeing me happy and turns out my parents would be unhappy。

 so being unhappy pacify all of that in my family。Okay， it's your choice。It's really your choice。😔。

那这个只能是你的选择了。Everybody being unhappy together doesn't sound like a healthy choice to me it sounds like we just don't trigger anybody but。

全家人在一起都不快乐，听起来不像是一个很健康的事情，只不过大家不会被彼此触发，可是生命呢。不过我理解你s it's scary to set yourself up as different。

So you know， I really don't know what to tell you， it's really your choice。我理解你特别怕跟自己的家人不同，但是这是你的选择。

But I want to say something about it to everyone， you know。

 there are positive bondings in family and negative bondings and negative bondings is if you happy。

 you betray us。If you're happy， you disrespect me， I disagree with that honestly。

 I don't think that's。That's like it's a bonding， but it's a negative bonding。

 it's not a positive bonding it's a way of。By choosing not to provoke anybody， by being yourself。

 you never get to live your life， is that what we're here for？you can live your life。

 can express yourself。那么在这里我想跟大家共同说一句话，我们与原生家庭的连接有正向的连接，有负向的连接，负向的连接就是那种若我们要快乐，我们就是对家族的一种背叛。

我觉得这样的连接是非常不好的。有的时候我们选择妥协在这样的连接当中，觉得自己只要是不变的与众不同，不要去触发家人，我就可以了。但是这样我们的生命又有怎样的意义呢。Okay everyone。

 so you know， I think this is what I want to talk about in my group in October。

 how we create family systems that support us to grow or prevent us from growing and we need to work with it。

那么这个部分就是我想在10月份跟大家深度讲解的议题，也就是如何去建立一个家庭系统，让这个家庭系统去支持我们的成长，如何去看到一个家庭系统对我们成长的阻碍。

I really believe in security。 I'm not someone who believes in security。

 but only security and no self expression is not really。 you never grow up。 You stay always a child。

 a half girl， a half woman，我并不是一个反对安全感的人，我是非常赞同安全感的人，但是只有安全感，没有来自于自我的表达，你永远不会成年，你永远只是一半女孩一般女人的状态。

 I understand you're afraid。 I understand that。 but what about your needs， What about you。

 do you know do you have needs。我非常理解你 you're taking care of everybody else's needs， but not your own。

非常的理解你啊，但是你一直都在照料其他人的需求，你自己的需求呢？You take care of your mother's needs， your sister's needs。

 But do you ever ask yourself， what about my needs， What about me，你照料着父母的需求，姐姐的需求，你问过我的需求是什么吗？

 Comee to my next group， will work this out。10月份的时候来参加我的课程，我们一起来解决这个题。It's your family system。

 we've got to open up that family system a little bit。这是你的家族系统，但是我们需要让这个家族系统拓宽一点，开放来去看一看他真实的样子。Okay。

 so everybody we've come to the end thank you all for being with me it was a pleasure to be with you好我们今天已经结束了非常感大家能跟我一共度这几天我非常的愉快跟你们在一起。
