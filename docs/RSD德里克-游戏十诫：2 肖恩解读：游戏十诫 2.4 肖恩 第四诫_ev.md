Commanment 4Ôºå thou shalt discern the logistics and social dynamics of the interaction„ÄÇ

I want to outline some things that will help you guys with logistics„ÄÇ

 and then I want to talk about one of the most underrated parts of game„ÄÇ

 which is understanding the social matrix„ÄÇ Logistics is one of the biggest differences between a guy who is good with girls and a guy who is okay with girls„ÄÇ

 guys there are taking girls home every single night are consistently thinking about logistics„ÄÇ

 A guy with the same technical skills who is not thinking about logistics„ÄÇ

 will take a girl home about once per month„ÄÇ WhyÔºå wellÔºå let's give some examples„ÄÇ

 Let's say that you meet a girl and she's your absolute soulmate„ÄÇ You guys get along so many levels„ÄÇ

 you have sexual chemistry„ÄÇ You have a connection„ÄÇ everything that you would need to take this girl home right now„ÄÇ

 And you start asking her the questions that Derek just went over„ÄÇ Well„ÄÇ

 I'm here with my entire extended family„ÄÇ and my fiance is standing 2 feet away from us„ÄÇ

 And we have to leave in an hour to drive 500 miles and be there at 6 AM so that I can go to my dad's view„ÄÇ

TomorrowÔºåAnd then after thatÔºå I have a wedding„ÄÇ it's my wedding„ÄÇ I'm getting married tomorrow„ÄÇ

 And also I'm super religious„ÄÇ And also I'm on my period„ÄÇ Well„ÄÇ

 she may be your soulmate pretty doubtful that that's going down tonight„ÄÇ

 So maybe you should go find some other options„ÄÇ Now„ÄÇ

 let's talk about maybe a girl who she's kind of into you„ÄÇ she's kind of on the fence„ÄÇ

 but you start asking her those questions„ÄÇ and she saysÔºå wellÔºå I'm newly single„ÄÇ

 I just had a terrible breakup and I'm looking for a rebound„ÄÇ I'm not here with anyone„ÄÇ

 I actually saw this club and just walked in because I'm just feeling super adventurous tonight„ÄÇ

 I'm staying actually at a mattressÔºå which is two feet from where we are right now„ÄÇ

 The mattress is right there„ÄÇ And all I want to do tonight is party and meet people and possibly meet a new guy„ÄÇ

 WellÔºå she may be on the fence„ÄÇ That's pretty much the best logistics possible„ÄÇ

 And so might be good to stay in that situation„ÄÇ So I've seen a lot of guys that are kind of intermediate at this„ÄÇ

üòäÔºåThey will try and stick in with a girlÔºå know the soulle mate that has the terrible logistics and'll be like„ÄÇ

 ohÔºå maybe it will work out„ÄÇ it will somehow work out„ÄÇ guess what happens„ÄÇ It doesn't work out„ÄÇ

 It doesn't work out because you can't make the impossible possible You're not God you have to take the attitude of I will work this out or it won't work out„ÄÇ

 And if you can't work it out if it is impossible to work it out just let it go„ÄÇ

 don't be the guy who thinks this is the only girl he'll ever get along with and he has to somehow make this work„ÄÇ

 that's complete bullshit thinking„ÄÇ there's always another girl he'll get along with and there's probably another girl in the club that you will get along with Another part to this is problem solving„ÄÇ

 Now there's 100 ways to get a girl„ÄÇ but there's probably a billion ways to screw it up„ÄÇ

 You need get into the habit now of learning how to proactively think about problems that will happen„ÄÇ

 This starts with thinking about how the interaction will realistically go and how it could realistically end„ÄÇ

 Stephen Covey calls this beginning with the end in mind„ÄÇ let's talk a bit about problem„ÄÇ

SolvingThe questions that you want to be consistently asking yourself with problem solving are A what problems might come up in this interaction B„ÄÇ

 what are potential solutions to those problems and CÔºå which solution would cause the least friction„ÄÇ

 So let's think about a common problem„ÄÇ number oneÔºå her friends„ÄÇ

 So many times a girl will be attracted to you and want to go home with you„ÄÇ

 but her friends will pull her away„ÄÇ There's a few compounding dynamics here that make that happen„ÄÇ

 FirstÔºå she may be attracted to youÔºå but she doesn't want to be judged by her friends for ditching them to sleep with a guy that she just met„ÄÇ

 SecondÔºå her friends or friend doesn't want to be left alone in the club on what was supposed to be their big night out„ÄÇ

 LastlyÔºå she may have a male friends whose jealous of you because he's been trying to sleep with this girl for five years and now you're going to do it in one night„ÄÇ

 So you have to be thinking about the different social dynamics and the different pressure she's under in this situation„ÄÇ

 So you have to ask yourself those three questions number oneÔºå where the problems that might come up„ÄÇ

 Her friends might pull her away„ÄÇ The guy might get in your face„ÄÇ

If you start making out with her in front of the friendsÔºå she might feel judged„ÄÇ

 you have to be thinking about those different pressures„ÄÇ

 those different dynamics that are happening within this interaction so let's talk about a few solutions to this problem and it will illustrate how you deal with friends so solution one befriending the friends Find out who is the girl's closest friend and who is the queen be of the group„ÄÇ

 the leader alpha female of the group because she is going to be making most of the decisions for that group of girls throughout the night and if her closest friend and the queen bee happen to be the same person great if not you're gonna have to do this with both of them engage with this girl or girls for about 25% of the time you're engaging with your girl have the same personality but beflier cut out the sexuality obviously you don't want to be hitting on her friends and be a little bit less polarizing because you want those polarizations to cause high emotions in the girl but not necessarily high emotions in the friend So after your girl is sufficiently on your side and isn't gonna to contradict you start peppering in little statements to a friend about how much you like her„ÄÇ

How you guys are perfect fit for each other and naturally shall agree„ÄÇ

 Make it abundantly clear that you're not here to ruin the friends's weekend and make sure the friend knows that she will be part of the fun„ÄÇ

 A lot of timesÔºå these friendsÔºå they're afraid thatÔºå okayÔºå wellÔºå if Susie leaves„ÄÇ

 then I'm not gonna have any fun anymore„ÄÇ I'm gonna be alone at this club„ÄÇ

 and my night will be ruined„ÄÇ You have to be cognizant that the friend came out here to have fun„ÄÇ

 too„ÄÇ She also might be a little bit jealous that her friend is down the guy and that she never got to find a guy„ÄÇ

 So you have to be friends her„ÄÇ once you've befriended her„ÄÇ once you've made it clearÔºå hey„ÄÇ

 I really like this girlÔºå we have a lot of fun together„ÄÇ etc ce„ÄÇ

 then you have to go have an honest conversation with her„ÄÇ Once she's a little bit on your side„ÄÇ

 go up to her and sayÔºå lookÔºå I really like your friendsÔºå we're getting along reallyÔºå really well„ÄÇ

 I would love to hang out with her„ÄÇ just me and her„ÄÇ nothing bads gonna happen„ÄÇ We're gonna be safe„ÄÇ

 It's gonna be fun etc ce„ÄÇ Then what you have to do is make sure that she realizes there's something in it for her„ÄÇ

 We call this bribing the friends„ÄÇ So you sayÔºå lookÔºå I always take care of the friends„ÄÇ

 I always take care of the friends„ÄÇ I'm gonna buy you a drink right now„ÄÇ

We're all gonna go out for breakfast tomorrow„ÄÇ You're gonna be part of the fun„ÄÇ It's gonna be great„ÄÇ

 etc„ÄÇ So you're thinking about what is this friend's motivations and what are the pressures this friend is under„ÄÇ

 and then you're also thinking about what is my girl's motivations but what are the pressures that my friend is under Oftentimes this works very very well make her part of the fun make sure she knows that you and your girl really really like each other and then just have an honest conversation with her don't say hey I'm taking your friend back for sex Just say hey I want to have some alone time with your friends„ÄÇ

 I promise that we will all have fun together and it will be safe for your friend solution number two This is probably the best solution just finding a guy for a friend„ÄÇ

 How do you do that WellÔºå find a wingman oftentimes the best interactions are where I'm talking to a girl and my wing is talking to her friend and we just all like each other and it's easy to go home after that However you might be out of alone So how do you execute this solution in that situation Well„ÄÇ

 one thing I've done is actually go and proactively find the friend a guy and I will make it like„ÄÇ

Fun little game with me and my girl will be likeÔºå ohÔºå we need to find someone for Sandra„ÄÇ

 Let's go find some guys like and then you know obviously if you go up to a guy and sayÔºå hey„ÄÇ

 you want to meet a hot girlÔºå what guy is gonna say no to that a little tip on this don't go find the friend necessarily the nicest looking guy in the club because she's probably gonna hate him go find her someone who actually knows what he's doing maybe who's a little bit of a dick„ÄÇ

 that's the one she's actually gonna like then they're gonna stay together all night and then you can go have fun with your girl„ÄÇ

 her friend can go have fun with that guy„ÄÇ a little tip I picked up from Derek solution number three talk your girl through the pressures that she's going to have to be going through if she wants to come home with you So what does this mean Well„ÄÇ

 if you're reallyÔºå really in with your girl and you both like each other„ÄÇ

 you want to go home together„ÄÇ you can actually do is tell your girl look at some point your friends are gonna come up„ÄÇ

 they're gonna try and take you away because they don't know me and they just want to keep you to themselves and you have to tell them no I'm gonna go have another drink with this guy it'll be fine be safe we're not gonna do anything you guys don't want us to do„ÄÇ

And you have to tell a girl to say this with conviction because girls are much more sensitive to social pressure than we are„ÄÇ

 You have to say this with conviction or else they won't go for it„ÄÇ

 And a lot of times the girls will say noÔºå I am going to hang out with this guy„ÄÇ

 I'm gonna go get a drink not gonna to do anything„ÄÇ

 I'm just gonna go get a drink with him and it will be fine„ÄÇ

 The girls eventually go okay that's fine Little side note Why is it that women are so much more sensitive to social pressure than we are And I want you actually think about this for a second„ÄÇ

 Why is that what would be the practical reasons why that is true The simplest answer in the world We are bigger than they are women have to worry about things that we don't have to worry about imagine if you lived in a world where 50% of the population was a foot taller than you and twice your weight and muscle mass You are naturally gonna have to worry about casual violence in a way that you wouldn't have to worry if you were the bigger sex„ÄÇ

 So you have to realize these girls they might sometimes come off as passive aggressive„ÄÇ

 they might sometimes come off as you know not being direct„ÄÇ

 sometimes they are bending to their friend social„ÄÇPressure and you have no idea why„ÄÇ

 Well the reason girls are more sensitive to social pressure is largely because they don't have the luxury that we have of being the biggest animals in the ecosystem„ÄÇ

 A lot of the currency that they have is social relationships so they have to maintain those social relationships with their friends they have to make sure that they don'tss off guys they have to maintain their social relationships with guys so they have to think about social situations in a way that we will never have to think about because they have to worry about violence and they have to worry about being ostracized from the group and being put into a world that's much more violent for them„ÄÇ

 solution number four just get her away from the friends„ÄÇ

 a lot of times I mean if you can just get her to a different part of the club than the friends„ÄÇ

 she'll kind of realize like okay if I go do what I want and go home with this guy„ÄÇ

 I can just tell my friends oh I got lost in the club and then just find them later„ÄÇ

 there's not that direct pressure of their friends looking right at them and her having to leave the club while her friends are looking So which solution to this problem will completely depend on context and the point of me illustrating this is so that you can„ÄÇ

Start thinking throughÔºå okayÔºå how do I problem solved in the real worldÔºü

 How do I balance the pressures the girls is under the desires the girls have and the obstacles that are gonna get in our way„ÄÇ

 Another part of logistics and problem solving that you need to think through where you guys actually gonna hook up This needs to be thought out beforehand„ÄÇ

 I can't tell you how many guys come on programÔºå they will meet an amazingÔºå amazing girl„ÄÇ

 and then you'll sayÔºå okay man she really likes youÔºå she seems down„ÄÇ

 why don't you take home they're likeÔºå oh I'm staying 90 minutes awayÔºå and it's like dude„ÄÇ

 what are you thinking the guys that are reallyÔºå really good at this„ÄÇ

 Not only do they know every single night where they're actually going take the girl„ÄÇ

 but they know how am I going get her thereÔºå am I going to take a car am I going take an Uber„ÄÇ

 am I going be walking is my place set up for this I my bed made if I walk in is my roommate gonna be jerking off on the couch do I have to go through the back So we don't see my roommate jerking off on the couch I there a little hole in the back that we're walking over it„ÄÇ

 we might trip and Theyve thought through all of this The thing is„ÄÇ

RememberBeginning with the end in mindÔºå you have to be planning this stuff before you go out„ÄÇ

 If your place is 90 minutes away from the next downtown area„ÄÇ

 the next place that you could foreseeably actually meet girls„ÄÇ

 guess what Mo Because logistics is the great equalizer is the difference between a guy who gets along of girls and a guy who is technically good with girls like he can get attraction„ÄÇ

 but never actually happen„ÄÇ Do you want to be the guy that's just really„ÄÇ

 really good at flirting or you want this stuff to actually happen„ÄÇ

 you actually want to have girls in your life„ÄÇ Other problems that might come up„ÄÇ N one„ÄÇ

 the phone girls loses her phones all the time„ÄÇ possible solutions be looking at her phone„ÄÇ

 make sure that she has it„ÄÇ if you guys are in reallyÔºå really good together„ÄÇ

 you offers to actually take her phone so that you have your hand on it„ÄÇ Another solution„ÄÇ

 make sure she actually puts her phone in the pocket or puts it in her purse rather than carrying it around„ÄÇ

Another problem is she getting tired„ÄÇ sometimes you guys might be hanging out at 3 a Does she need caffeine Does she need food„ÄÇ

 Another problem„ÄÇ What's the weather like Is it freezing outside„ÄÇ

 I can tell you actually had a girl in Minneapolis different girl in Minneapolis than the one before We were having an amazing time Super hot girl ordered an Uber and then walked outside and because we were waiting for 10 minutes because the Uber was just driving a random directions„ÄÇ

 they got too cold she had to go inside and then her friend's bound her and wouldn't let her leave with me end up having to call and go home with the girl had gone home with the previous night So it didn't get two girls that weekend„ÄÇ

 Another problem is she wearing heels if you guys have to walk five blocks her feet might hurting you might have to carry her you might have to get her to take her heels off„ÄÇ

 The point isn't to make an extensive list of every problem that will come up But for you to start being aware of potential problems planning as many out beforehand as possible building a repertoire of potential solutions from building that resourcefulness muscle to be able to handle those problems on the fly So problem solving„ÄÇ

And logistics plays nicely into one of the most important topics you will ever learn about in your entire life„ÄÇ

 which is basic social intelligence and how to navigate the social matrix„ÄÇ

 This is one of the most underrated topics in game and the most frequently ignored Why because game is so focused on being yourself„ÄÇ

 being polarizing and not taking cues from others„ÄÇ The people often forget that you have to have a deep understandings of the ins and outs of the social matrix„ÄÇ

 The guys that are the best at the stuff are the ones that are most socially intelligence„ÄÇ

 Theyre the ones that are able to read emotions and they are the ones that are able to read social situations„ÄÇ

 A lot of the rules of social interaction are arbitrary un sexexy„ÄÇ

 which is why they get ignored when we're talking about this stuff„ÄÇ A great example is a handshake„ÄÇ

 let's say the girl introduce you to a male friends and you don't shake his hand„ÄÇ

 Smallest thing in the world„ÄÇ but he might be offended by that and might piss off her friends the friends might not like you and that she might take the guy away„ÄÇ

 You have to understand these little details of the social matrix„ÄÇ It's your job to understand„ÄÇ

The rules of the culture that you are in and to feel out when those rules are necessary and when they can be broken„ÄÇ

 this is not the same as succumbing to social conditioning„ÄÇ

 Derek understands social rules and the social matrix Probably better than anyone I've ever seen„ÄÇ

 He's also known as one of the most polarizing one of the most intense guys in this field„ÄÇ

 But the reason that stuff works for him is because he understands in this situation I have to follow this social rule„ÄÇ

 and he understands the stuff so thoroughly that he can navigate complex social interactions very„ÄÇ

 very quickly„ÄÇ So to build social intelligence you have to be asking yourself a few questions about the people you meet What is this person's subjective worldview„ÄÇ

 What is this person's desires and what do they value„ÄÇ How does this person operate„ÄÇ

 What actions do I need to take to reach my desired goal„ÄÇ

 very similar to the questions that we are asking ourselves about problem solving„ÄÇ

 And that's why this is so connected„ÄÇ Think about the above example with friends„ÄÇ

 What is her friends subjective worldview„ÄÇ WellÔºå her friend might be„ÄÇSe„ÄÇ

She might feel that your girl always gets guys is prettier than her„ÄÇ

 and she is going to interrupt the interaction just because she's angry and insecure about those factors„ÄÇ

 She might be a feminist and she might not like guys approaching girls at the club„ÄÇ

 She might be religious and she might think that a guy taking home a girl on the first night is immoral„ÄÇ

 You have to be thinking about how is the friend conceptualize the world„ÄÇ

 next question was the friend's desiresÔºå whether do they value„ÄÇ WellÔºå in this situation„ÄÇ

 they might desire wanting to get drunk with her friend„ÄÇ They might desire wanting to find a guy„ÄÇ

 They might desire wanting to go home and smoke weedÔºå She might desire just being aloneÔºå Great„ÄÇ

 How's this person operateÔºå Shes the type of person that's going to be passive aggressive„ÄÇ

 She's the type of person that's going to tell you exactly what she thinks„ÄÇ

 Is she the type of person that she might feel jealous of her friends or she might feel like she just wants to hang out with her friends„ÄÇ

 But she sees that a friend likes youÔºå And so she's going to let it happen„ÄÇ

 Different people deal with situations in different waysÔºå And you have to suss that out„ÄÇ

 What actions do I need to take„ÄÇReach my desired goal and that's where we go through the solutions that I just outlined and why they work well in different contexts when you start to be able to understand one person's answers to these questions and a related persons answers to these questions„ÄÇ

 you begin to see what's called the social matrix and this gets bigger and bigger and bigger and you start to be able to go through the social matrix increasingly complex ways So let's think about a situation where you have to analyze a lot of different people's answers to these questions„ÄÇ

 a lot of people's subjective worldviewsÔºå a lot of people's desires understanding how a lot of different people operate and understanding what actions you need to take in that complex situation Well„ÄÇ

 let's think about a partyÔºå a party where everyone knows each other and you are talking to a girl and you're hitting it off Well you have to think about your friends or your friends„ÄÇ

 the type of people that will help this interaction or they the type of people that will sabotage it„ÄÇ

 you have to think about what other guys at this party like her you have to think about what other girls are at this party„ÄÇ

 what type of worldview do they have you have to think about the girl„ÄÇ

What type of worldview does she haveÔºå Does she like standing up to social pressure or does she not like standing up to social pressure„ÄÇ

 Does she think that she should only sleep with guys on the third date„ÄÇ

 Does she like going home with guys nowÔºå I there maybe someone in the party that's likely to get drunk and start a fight and ruin the mood of everyone„ÄÇ

 Is there someone in the party that's maybe gonna start hitting on her friends and then make her more comfortable with going home with you because her friend is now going home with someone„ÄÇ

 Everyone knows each other in this partyÔºå everyone has different desires„ÄÇ

 everyone has different worldview and everyone operates a little bit differently„ÄÇ

 The more you can be aware of this stuff while still being detached from social conditioning and not looking to others to make decisions for you and not looking to others for your sense of certainty„ÄÇ

 the better you will be able to handle these situations„ÄÇ

 This isn't something you should get bogged down within the club„ÄÇ

 This is the type of automatic thinking that you build over time„ÄÇ

 The best time to practice this stuff is while going through your day to- day life„ÄÇ

 I start asking myself these questions when I'm talking to a store clerk„ÄÇWhen I'm in an Uber„ÄÇ

 I want to understand where people are coming from„ÄÇ

 how are they naturally going to act and once you see that„ÄÇ

 then you start seeing two people interacting with each otherÔºå how do they act together„ÄÇ

 how do their desires play off of each other So be aware of this„ÄÇ

 this is something to think about in the long term and an intelligence to build up over time but not necessarily something that you should be thinking of very„ÄÇ

 very actively in the cloud because it will use up too much mental ra frames to help you understand social dynamics„ÄÇ

Number oneÔºå you can never eliminate bias„ÄÇ What does this meanÔºå Well„ÄÇ

 imagine you meet an old psychology professor„ÄÇ They're about 60 years old„ÄÇ They've seen it all„ÄÇ

 They've seen their own situationsÔºå and they know all of the stuff that we're talking about right now„ÄÇ

 And you might thinkÔºå wellÔºå they know about the halo effect„ÄÇ They know about rationalization„ÄÇ

 They know about judging a book by its cover„ÄÇ So you might think to yourselfÔºå Oh„ÄÇ

 this person would never engage in those psychological tendencies because they know so much about the psychological tendencies„ÄÇ

 wrong„ÄÇ In factÔºå that personÔºå the old psychology professor is the person most likely to engage in those tendencies„ÄÇ

 because they know about them and they think they are above them„ÄÇ

 You can never eliminate bias and you can never eliminate these psychological tendencies in people because people have too little mental ram„ÄÇ

 They are naturally going to like people that remind them of some person they liked before„ÄÇ

 They are naturally going to not like someone that reminds them of someone they don't like bias„ÄÇ

Happenss with everyone„ÄÇ You can never eliminate bias„ÄÇ

 So guess what you might as well use it What does this meanÔºå Well„ÄÇ

 let's say that you missed your flight and then you need to go talk to someone at the airport and you think„ÄÇ

 if I just explain my situation to this personÔºå they'll understand„ÄÇ

 If I were to engage in stuff like smilingÔºå eye contact„ÄÇ

 all those little things that everyone says is' supposed to cause a bias in my favor„ÄÇ

 that doesn't work„ÄÇ they're professionalsÔºå the professionals„ÄÇ

 of course they don't engage in that kind of biasÔºå they give everyone equal treatment and you go up and you just monotonously state your case„ÄÇ

 WellÔºå what's going to happenÔºå We already know what's gonna happen in that situation„ÄÇ

 are' probably gonna say noÔºå What if you go up and you smile and you compliment them„ÄÇ

 or if you can tell the type of person that doesn't like validation„ÄÇ

 maybe you act a little bit high status„ÄÇ WellÔºå no matter how professional that person is„ÄÇ

 by adding in those little details that create bias in your favor„ÄÇ

 you are always going to get a better result„ÄÇ start realizing that no one has enough mental ra to think of all the psychological biases„ÄÇ

and that you're going to have to work with those psychological tendenciesÔºå not against them„ÄÇ

 Great example„ÄÇ Let's say that you're being interviewed or you're interviewing someone„ÄÇ

 Do you think there is more of a chance of you getting hired If you make that person feel good„ÄÇ

 if you make them laugh„ÄÇ Let's say you have the exact same resume and you get the exact same answers to the questions„ÄÇ

 Well if you make that person feel good„ÄÇ They're naturally going to associate your application with those good feelings„ÄÇ

 They are going to have that little bit of bias is going to work in your favor„ÄÇ

 People are constantly forgetting about these little things and they are constantly focusing on what the person thinking rather than what is the person feeling„ÄÇ

 You can't eliminate bias and you should always focus on those little psychological tendencies„ÄÇ

 and what type of emotionsÔºå you are making this person have next frame of understanding social dynamics„ÄÇ

 Never get in the way of someone's selfishness„ÄÇ Everyone is selfishÔºå this isn't a bad thing„ÄÇ

 if people weren't selfishÔºå they would die of starvation„ÄÇ

 We're not saying selfish as in they're going to kill you for their moneyÔºå orre saying„ÄÇ

Sfish as in they are naturally going to gravitate towards those actions that will help them get the perceived best outcomes and then they will rationalize later why they did that thing and why it is in alignment with their values people do this all the time you do this too Was this mean and practicality it means if you want something from someone you have to be thinking about how it aligns with their own selfish interests and how you can communicate that to them„ÄÇ

There's a million ways to act on this„ÄÇ If you can help someone understand that their own selfish interests are aligned with your interests„ÄÇ

 they will be more likely to help you„ÄÇ And if you get in the way of someone's selfish interests„ÄÇ

 they will always find a way to block you„ÄÇ Last one„ÄÇ

 everyone wants more positive emotions and everyone responds to status and value„ÄÇ

 is similar to the fact that you can never eliminate bias„ÄÇ

 you should always be thinking about how can I give this person more positive emotions and how can I portray myself in a way that shows value You can be doing the exact same things and taking the exact same actions„ÄÇ

 But if you are able to do it in a way that gets people to feel good and that is coming from a place of status or value„ÄÇ

 those same actions in those same words will have massively more effect„ÄÇ

 This is why a nice guy might send a girl flowers and the girl will think it's fucking disgusting„ÄÇ

 While when a celebrity sends a girl flowersÔºå it might be seen as a sign that he's a really„ÄÇ

 really good guy„ÄÇ StaÔºå value and emotions come into play in„ÄÇ

W do you speak in every situation you are in„ÄÇ So you need to be cognizant of them„ÄÇ Now„ÄÇ

 you might be wonderingÔºå wellÔºå I know how to show status and value„ÄÇ

 we went over that a little bit in opening those subcomicationsÔºå but how do I do that„ÄÇ

 let's say with a boss who could potentially fire me„ÄÇ

 I don't want to necessarily be acting like a cocky dick in front of him„ÄÇ

 you can use the subcommunications that show status value and positive emotions„ÄÇ

 practice being a source of positive emotions„ÄÇ funÔºå relaxedÔºå vital„ÄÇ

 We're gonna get into all of those in the next commandments„ÄÇ practice being a source of value„ÄÇ

 leading authenticityÔºå real worldor problem solving certainty„ÄÇ

 understand why people think feel and behave in the way they do„ÄÇ

 but also understand what you need to do with each understanding„ÄÇ

 a lot of guys will get caught up in wonderingÔºå ohÔºå okayÔºå this is this person's desire„ÄÇ

 This is that person's desire„ÄÇ and it all becomes just a mental clutter„ÄÇ

 Think about what you need to do more of what you need to do less of what you need to do the same of in this particular situation to get your„ÄÇ

Desired outcome„ÄÇ OtherwiseÔºå you're trained to be a philosopher instead of a leader„ÄÇ

 This is one of those small thingsÔºå but there's been studies on this on this exact thing I'm talking about right now„ÄÇ

 People that ask whatÔºå in addition to why get actions„ÄÇ

 Where people are always thinking about why do not book recommendations„ÄÇ

 social intelligence by Daniel Goldman„ÄÇThe like switch by Marlin Carvins and Jack Schaffer exercise for 21 days„ÄÇ

 try to make every person you meet feel positive emotions„ÄÇÂîî„ÄÇ
