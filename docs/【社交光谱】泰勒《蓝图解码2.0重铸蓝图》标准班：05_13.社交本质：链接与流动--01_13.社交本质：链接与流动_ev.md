# 【社交光谱】泰勒《蓝图解码2.0重铸蓝图》标准班：05_13.社交本质：链接与流动--01_13.社交本质：链接与流动_ev

Yeah。我是社交官谱莱特，那么我们继续蓝图解码2。0之旅。这节课呢泰勒也做了一个非常深刻的一个反思啊，就是技术流，它限制了我们的一个社交流动，技术只能作为拐杖。你前期走路的时候可以用。

但是你一直用技术丢不下拐杖，长期以后呢，你就会变成一个瘸子，就会丧失社交的本质，让人中毒。那么社交的本质是什么呢？社交的本质是通过改变自己的内在，从而正确去理解一种社交的动态。

你可以用一个眼神来让别人开怀大笑，而不是用一句完美的的台词。所以你们学习蓝图2。0是让你去学习心态，学习内核，而不是说去学习一些现成的一些台词，一些技术。我们可以看到很多中毒的人，痛苦的背诵台词。

对于共振和幽默，毫无概念。我们社交光谱说了很多次，就是想让你们真正的做自己，怎么去变得自然，同时呢减少对于技术的运用，跟我们一起学习，从你的社交技巧，线下约会，社交光谱都会教会你尽可能少用技术策略。

而更多的依靠自由流动。我不希望你们刻意去做一些东西，去刻意的去学一些技巧，让这些刻意的东西，成为你去跟别人产生链接的方法，这些都是我不希望的。我希望你们的动力源于你真实的自己。

🎼你的内在能量以及你的知行合一，但就是一些人总是不明白。哎，老师问这句话应该怎么回，怎么回。那么如果你继续问怎么回的话，请务必看完本节课。那么我们正式开始。

So the first thing I want to do is let's review some of the things that we laid in yesterday okay and then I'm going to show you how to build on it and then we're going to jack up the pressure so yesterday what we did was we started let's go through just a couple of the exercises。

 what of them was learning how to just say describe your drive here under under with great tonality right what do we say to divorce。

 we said we're going to divorce something， what was it？😡，The content from what？😡，The emotion， right。

 So， you know， if like when I pick up this tea right here and I look at it and it says honest tea。

 And there's a lemon on it right there。 And that lemon。

 you could imagine if you were to just eat lemon straight and you put that lemon in your mouth it could be very。

 very strong， right， your face of mine wince right as you're eating lemon。

 And then whatll happen is you can mix it up with tea， maybe add a little sugar into it。

 And now all of a sudden， that lemon tastes amazing， the lemon， the lemon tastes amazing and。Really。

Something like this。This kind of drink。This is not an ordinary drink， like say， a Coca Cola。

This is something that's going to give you energy。And at the same time。

 it's going to give you antioxidants。And at the same time， it's just going to make you feel really。

 really good。 really， really good。 I mean， you drink this。 You are going to feel really， really。

 really good。😊，You're going to feel。Re， now， notice， I can make you laugh without a joke。

 Did you see that。Look， I just made you laugh doing nothing。I made you laugh doing nothing。

Like a Jedi。I willed for you to laugh。Don't laugh。Don't laugh。I have kids too， so you know。

 I'm good at this。Okay。You see why I'm so good at meeting people now？Okay， I see， right by the way。

One of the biggest criticisms of what I've taught in dating over the years is they say he doesn't tell me what to say。

 when I can walk up to somebody and make them laugh just by looking at them。

 Do you understand how low level that looks to me。Do you understand how utterly low level and pathetic？

That looks to me， Do you know how painful it is for me to teach at a basic level。

 like then you're going to say this？And watching people painfully going up。

 having no concept of vibing or humor， reciting a canned script when by the right changes inside yourself and write understandings of social dynamics。

 you can crack somebody up harder with a look than you can with the perfect line。 It is absurd。 Okay。

 imagine how much that drives me crazy， right， And yet。

 no matter how many times I would say this online。 there's you know there's always gonna be these people that just don't get it。

 They're like， no， I need to be told like to say daddy， daddy。😡，Tell me， daddy， what do I say， daddy。

 I'm like， I'm not your dad， just learn this。I know I'm bald and have a dad bought。

 but I'm not your actual dad。 So let's teach you how to do this for real and not give you a can line。

 So energetically， energetically， you can dictate the tone。 You can make it where you know。

 you could be talking about a T。😡，And you can make that compelling just by your tone。

 Whatever I'm going to say right now， you're going to listen。😡，You're going to listen。

And it's purely because of the tone and the pitch， the projection， the conviction。

 the changes in cadence。 that's called being a master public speaker， a master communicator。😡。

So I want to get you to the point where you have utter control with your crowd or in video。

 Do you understand the degree to which you could be doing。

 say a sales video and you can move people to buy when you have the simple skill。

 if I can look at you and get you laughing， what does that mean for my sales abilities。😡。

If you learn this， what does that mean about your income then？😡，You're thinking right now， oh。

 to make more money， I should work more hours at my job。 I'm thinking。

 why don't you learn how to sell and sell $30 million worth of products and then keep a chunk of it。

 I'm thinking completely at a different paradigm。😡，The real way to make money in life， you know。

 it is not just through hard labor。 It's basically by。

Scaling your efforts to get all these different people to do things， right。

 Like when I run this event， what I would be getting from this event would be several people's yearly income in four days。

 Do you realize that。Does that make you mad a little bit？It should， you should be mad。But not at me。

Who should you be mad at？Yeah， don't be mad at me because I'm gonna show you how to do it。

 You should be mad at yourself for the fact that you haven't been doing it。

 So I want to show you again with marketing and sales。

 but I want to make it where you're legendary at this。

 I want to get you to a very high level see I've studied Internet marketing。

 I understand how Internet marketing works。 I love that stuff。 I love Dan Kennedy， John Carlleton。

 these guys are amazing。 But the piece that they don't necessarily teach that I love teaching。

 They'll teach you to some extent they'll cover it， they'll touch on it。

 But the area where I feel like I can really teach you Internet marketing or sales is this aspect of social dynamics where even if you are using 10% of the sales tactics they teach your result would be triple。

😡，That's awesome in my mind。For me， it's always been about less tactic， more natural， less tactic。

 more natural。Whatever I've done， say social skills dating。I want to use 10% of the tactic stuff。

 really， like minimal， minimal， minimal。 I want it where you can just look at someone they laughing。

 So， you know， I might have the odd， the odd little can joke here there or something like that。

 That's like 5% of what I do。 but I don't want to I don't want that to be the driving force in me meeting somebody。

 I want it to be about me， my energy。 The fact that I'm aligned and are doing these different skills。

 So I want you to have this。 I want to teach to see at the highest level。

 and not just teach it to you intellectually， I want to get you doing it here together in these exercises。

 Okay， So the first exercise we said again， we're divorcing what， the what from the what。

The content from the emotion， okay？Another exercise that we did was we looked at dominant vocaltonnality and whatever kind of tonality that works for you。

 right， if you're somebody who wants to make someone feel invited and to make someone feel comfortable or to even embolden somebody to kind of lead you somewhere。

 then maybe you use the trying for rapport。 so they feel confident right。😡，You know， let's say。

You know。Let's say that you're wanting to get someone you want to invite someone to take initiative with you。

 Well then maybe you'd use the trying for rapport。 But if you're somebody who wants to come across as dominant and confident。

 then we saw yesterday the extent to which by changing the downsloping pitch。

 but still adding positivity， positive dominance。 That's gonna be a completely different status level that you're coming across as。

 But we also saw that we need interchange to make that congruent because the guys could only hold it for a minute and then they'd overly blink or they'd look uncomfortable so it didn't look fully real。

 but you'd see those moments where it did look real。 Okay great。😡，Now， next what else did we have。

 let's go over it from yesterday I'm just remembering them myself。 we had the talking projection。

 you guys remember projection。 Okay， projection is essentially， here's what it is， okay。😡。

This is the main key to adhere here in review。If you view yourself as low status。😡。

Your mind will shut down any brilliance that you have。

And what it will do is it will put you into- here's the main keys of it， okay。😡。

Let's look at the basic benchmarks of low status and how it changes when you go on high status。

And by the way，If you've studied Eastern philosophy， guys like Ehar Tolller。

 a great introduction to that。 goes that rabbit hole goes very deep。 Fun enough。

 even though that rabbit holele goes deep， I actually think Ehart's the best。 Like， in my mind。

 this is a rare case where the most mainstream， cheesy guy that I don't want to admit I like。

 because it's like the obvious mainstream choice。 And I want to be a hipster contrarian or whatever。

He's actually the best， in my view。The best that I've seen， There could be better。

 but he's the best that I've seen， but there could be better， so。VeryVery bizarre。 Normally。

 the best guy at anything， like the one that's the most popular has dumbed down。But to me， Ehart。

 if you look at the quality of this consciousness。I don't think he is like I think his message is dumb down。

let me give you an example。 you have a guy say Ken Wilbur， you guys ever studied him？

And then you have a guy like Ehart。 Ken Wilbert's message is way more complex and interesting。

 Eharts is less interesting and more simple。 But if I look at the energy that I get from them。

 I think Ken is so cool。 He's so I would love hang out of them。

 But I think even he would agree because everybody is at their own journey。

 I think even he would agree。 I don't know。 but I'm guessing I think he would agree that Ehart。

 The quality of this consciousness is really at at a very unique level。 It's quite outstanding。

 actually， It's just remarkable。😊，If you look at the quality of my consciousness， by the way。

 what are some things that you'll notice are elements that I have as an entrepreneur。

 but who's also into eastern philosophy， just as a quick side tang。

 What are some things that you notice， because my I'm definitely not the level of Ecar by any means or any measure。

 What are some things， But I'm kind of like him though。

 So what do you guys notice about me that I bring to the table for you。 Yeah。I've never that。你音为就。

like Julia。嗯嗯。😊，That my head。Interesting， right， Yeah， it's interesting。 Yeah。

 so because I'm kind of grounded my own energy， that will cause other people to become reactive to me。

 It's and you'll get the exact same experience when you do it。 It's because。

It's not that you want me to react to you because you don't。

But probably it kind of freaks you out that I don't。I know this because I feel that way。

 Whatever I'm talking to someone that has no reaction to me at all， you're kind of like。

You know it's this weird thing that it does。 And then it makes you crave their validation。

 even if the person has nothing to offer。 like sometimes around just club promoters。

 I find myself just falling in their frame， but they're just coke heads。But， you know。

 but I fall in there because I I feel it， too。 you know， it's a funny thing。 But yeah。

 that's the one aspect of it。 What are some other things you notice that you feel from me。

 It's important because you're gonna have to audit what you want people to feel from you。

 That's why I'm asking。 It's really about you。 But I'll use it myself as a quick example。嗯。

That is true， and here's why， so as I've been handling what I have going on in here。😡。

It gives me more bandwidth to think about you。So when this is handled， which I am， to some extent。

 like probably。Light years ahead of the average person。

 light years away from where I would like to be。 So because average because the average person says the standard is so low。

 So I don't even want to compare to the average person。 So because I've handled this。

There's not a lot of thinking going on。 very little。 So I can look at you in the pupil。

 and I can roughly know what you're thinking。And because of that， I can empathize with you。 Okay。

 what's another one There's one or two main ones I want you to get， yeah。Around you guys。

 let's be clear， we all have the people that will seek reaction around。 But around， you know。

 in in general， areas where I'm strong， no reaction seeking in areas that I'm strong。

 I say that to make it clear that。I don't know anybody that doesn't have someone that they're gonna to react to。

 And if they don't， I usually believe that's a personality disorder。

 The only people that I know that probably would never have reaction to anybody would be someone like Donald Trump who probably has NPD。

 He exhibits a lot of textbook cases。 By the way， people with NPD can be amazing。

 That's not a criticism of him。😡，It sounds like it is。 It's not。 It is dude。

 Michael Jordan probably also has NPD。 Eddiedie's awesome。 So I'm not criticizing it。Again。

 I don't want to get too deviated off this。Nature doesn't make mistakes。 In this sense。

 There's a reason that a certain percentage of the population is gay。

 There's an evolutionary reason for that。 It adds value to the tribe。

 We need a percentage of the population to be gay for certain reasons that you could guess， right。

 that say that we're straight。 and we go out to go hunting。

You don't want to leave no men behind to protect the women in a hunter's tribe， right。

 You need some men that are there that the women absolutely love that。 the women love to death。

 that can help them and protect them in a harsh violent environment。 Likewise。

 you need about3 or4% of of the33 or4 percentage of the population to be completely delusional。

You need that， do you understand why？Well， first of all， what if we go to war。

 Do you want to go stab somebody， I don't。But there's a certain percentage of people that do。

 And we need them， right， Likewise， say that we're gonna like try to get out of our one little area that we've been evolving in。

 You know， maybe I think they said it was like South Africa or something as miners saying。

 I don't know。 Well， you need that one crazy guy that's like， we're going up the out。

 And you're like， that doesn't even make any sense。 You're not gonna make it up。 They're like。

Ridiculous， let's go。 You're like， okay， right， So a lot of narcissists make incredible founders。

 right， if you who here seeing the fire festival documentary。

I think Billy from Fire Festival is gifted。 I think he's a gifted founder。

 And now you're gonna say to me， no， he's not lies， lies， lies。 He's a horrible manager leader。

 You don't want him to have access to the bank account。 No way。

 keep that guy out of the bank account， Don't let him near the bank account。

 no matter how confident he looks。 In fact， the more confident he looks。

 the more you should keep him out of the bank account。 But he got multiple celebrities to come。

 I would challenge。 if you had a gun to your head， you couldn't get as far as he did。😡。

If you had a gun to your head。You couldn't get as far as he did of almost pulling off a pretty awesome festival。

Almost。Right， narcissists make incredible founders。The seed， the initiator。

 if Billy would have pulled everybody together， but then handed it off to a competent management。

 fire festival would have been incredible。😡，So we're always going to have sub narcissists in our society and thank God we do。

But they're also gonna make a complete mess of things by the way。

 the extent to which your narcissist can jump the shark and do things that are so crazy and weird until you dealt with a narcsist in a close level。

 You have no idea。 They can mess up your life to an extent you don't even have a context for it right now。

 likewise， if you date someone with BPD。 but let's not make this the personality disorder seminar。

 I'll make a whole other seminar called personality disorder revealed we can share all my experiences on that。

 I've got a lot to say but my life in many ways is the blessing of having worked with people that have NPD or sociopathy that convinced me to do things that I didn't know they had that。

 You know， I'm in my early 20。 or like， let's go do this。 Let's go do that。 I'm like。😡。

That's impossible。 They're like， no， we're the shit。 You know， I'm like， okay， you know。

 and I would just go do it。 And then next thing， you know， I'm getting success。 But then next thing。

 you know， they're ripping me off。 So， you know， so it's sort of a funny thing right where， you know。

 or they're screaming at people or making chaos or doing。

Do it just doing things that are completely insane。 But yeah， it's very powerful。

 let's get back on it。 The other thing I want you to get from me， like I said， is when you're around。

 when you're around me， you should be feeling very much like you want to take action。

 you just want to do something and you feel optimistic do you feel when you're around me do you feel like you want to take a lot of action and a lot of your insecurities go away and you just want to take massive action。

 you're optimistic。 part of that is because I also do sales。 Okay So when I got you to come here。

 you might have had innerresistance because you're thinking。

 I don't know if I can afford to come here。 And I've got to I've got to get you thinking in what's called irrational exuberance。

 Okay I've got to be that crazy guy with NPD getting you to do this seminarbinar。😡，Here's why。

Nobody has savings these days， but yet they can come up with money。So because nobody has savings。

 if you want to be a truly great salesperson， you want to have something in your mind where you always feel like everything is gonna to be awesome if we go do this。

 Now， here's another thing that I also have from years of socializing。😊。

You guys know what I mean when I use the word socializing， right？You get what that word means。😡。

Right， so from years of socializing， what I also have is a carefr attitude。

And a nonjugmental attitude。Carefree and nonjudgmental。

 These are energies that you have to put in your body。 For example， say that you're in dating， right。

 Now， let's say the person that you're dating feels very judged and its maybe overthinking if they'd like to have maybe an intimate relationship with you。

Okay， maybe after they just met you。 Well， if you're very carefree， very light， very nonjudmental。

 very fun， very exuberant， and it's about like， for example， Russell Brand。

 one line that that he has that he'll say。😊，He'll say， you know， we're just on the spitting rock。

 We're all gonna to die someday。 We've got to enjoy the moment while it lasts。

 We've got to celebrate life。 Well， how much you think that that helps them to maybe meet somebody very quickly and have that move towards intimacy。

 What do you think。😊，RightBecause he's carefree， he's nonjudgmental， he's in the moment。

 say a guy like Anthony Robins， who's all about take action now， and then he goes to make a sale。

 how do you think that helps him？It's tremendous。 So， you know。

 a guy like Ecartoll as part of his vibe， he'll get you to really relax because he's relaxed。

 So what I want you to start thinking about as we go in these exercises， also。

 what is your energetic signature And really that should be say the word adaptive。

That should be adaptive to what it is that you're trying to accomplish whatever your goals are。

 My goals are I do a lot of selling。 I do a lot of meeting people and moving that towards fun wild adventures。

 So I've got to be in a mode of nonjugment。 I want to be a combination of the following things。

 I want to be present to the moment， because I believe in that very deeply。

 I want to be nonjudgmental。 I want to be relaxed。 But that at the same time， kind of hyp。😊。

So that way people move and take action。 I want to energize people right， you know。

 I was hanging out with some my friends last night and they're saying I don't even feel they need to go to sleep。

 I got to have this weird thing where around me， it's like you don't even think you need to go to sleep。

 It's like you'll think you have unlimited energy around me It's almost like a Viking at the head of the canoe and I'm like。

 because I'm also a leader。 I have a huge staff。 So I've got to keep a staff who might be getting tired。

 energized all the time。 So I've got to be that spark plug。 So I've got to be tapped in。

 and when people around me， they're feeding off of me for energy。

 Likewise they feel energized if they're in a crowd。 so I've curated all this。

 I've cultivated it's out a part of my energy at this point。

 and everything's gonna to be adaptive to who you are where you come from and you're life circumstances right It's like if somebody comes from the inner city and it's very dangerous they're gonna have a vibe where you're a little bit afraid of them。

 You're gonna feel it off them because they've come from a violent environment So you're gonna feel a bit of fear coming off them。

 Maybe somebody could be a priest and they want someone to feel welcome and they can give a confession。

😡，And you're going to feel that energy coming from them， right， Maybe， you know。

 maybe somebody could be like like。you know， a seducer。 and they have this kind of sexual vibe。

 a very sensual sexual vibe。 you know， I've dated one of my last girlfriends。

 She told me that that she had a that in her last life。

 she was like a seducts or something like that。 her psychic friend told her this。

 I don't really know if that could be true or not。 But when you look at her。

 if you were to just see her sitting here， literally just sitting here， you'd be getting aroused。

 And she's very， very beautiful physically， but you know what。

 I've met many girls more physically beautiful than her， many。

 many of them more beautiful than even though she's stunning。

 but there's many more beautiful than her。 she would know that。

 But there's not a lot of women that you'd be more aroused by。

 It's to the point like literally have to run home and like handle things you're just like you know because she has a very like when she bats her eyes。

 it's very slow movements are slow， she'll look at you。

 she'll playy know and you're like it starts to get it starts's like a hamster digging his way into the center of your brain。

 It's like it's great compliment。You're like a hamster digging But like， you know。

 she really had that。 And it really affects you。 It really gets under your skin， right。

 It really can。 If I was ever gonna to teach women dating。

 I would be showing them all sorts of stuff like that。 It would be really fun。

 And you can really learn a lot of that stuff。 And you can even execute that yourself。

 So I want you to be thinking about your energetic signature and。😊，Unfortunately。

 there is a degree to which we are the product of our environment。

 Ty Lopez is one thing that he said to me and well be digging into a course strength tomorrow。

 So I want you to think about this， too。Ty Lopez when I took his seminar。

 which was before he was even famous。 by the way， It was really cool。

 I've known him since before that。😊，He said。You are a product of your upbringing and your environment and your natural attitudes。

 and you can't change that。😡，And you've got to just accept that you are the proier environment。

 And then you've got to just build on that。 That really bothered me when I first heard it。

 Does that bother some of you guys to think that like， like， if you're 25。

 that the last 15 years of your life， if you don't do something in alignment with that。

 you're probably gonna fail。 Does that bother you。It bothers me too， I think it's true。

I think it's the truth。I think he's right。Okay， here's why I say it。I've been doing public speaking。

For almost 20 years， right， if I decide to pick up right now and become an accountant。I miss my shot。

😡，I did。 I missed my shot。 I'm not going to be at the same level as an accountingant as I am as a speaker。

 It's not going to happen。😡，Now， I know what you're thinking。 you're in self-hel world， right。

 Anything's possible。 about okay， stop， give me one moment。 It's like， stop， bro。

 you spoke for 20 years。 This is what you're good at。

 You should think of ways to make that work At a certain point。

 you've lived your life in a certain way。 and you can try to reverse that whole thing and retra yourself from scratch。

😡，It's probably not going happen。 My honest advice to you is look at the areas where you've been building on that for the past couple decades。

 Look at the type of energetic components that you have。 And I would urge you to build on that。 Now。

 there's gonna be people that are gonna say that's limiting or bad advice or that I'm leading you down the wrong path。

 And you know what， there's always that one Colonel Sanders。They start a business at 65。

And he crushed it。 I get that。 There's always that one guy。If you want to try。

 if you want to roll the dice and see if you're going to be Colonel Sanders， you go right ahead。

You go right ahead。Go for it。But in L A， the city of Dream。

 I have met so many people who I gave the same advice。

 Every single person that I gave this advice to and didn't listen。

 They wanted to become an actor or a DJ or whatever it was was they're trying to do。

Every single one that I told the suit failed at it， came back  four or five years later and said。

 what was I thinking， I should have listened to you， I'd be light yearss ahead。 Every single one。

So in my case， if I say， look， I'm not going to be a super high levelve accountant。

 is that me with a limiting belief and me being negative and me being a pessimist and not seeing all the possibilities of life。

 or is that me honoring who I am， honoring my past， ordering my genetic predispositions and saying。😡。

Why can't I build an amazing life using what I have and maybe pick 10 or 20% to maybe cover some new areas。

 but building on strength。 Okay so there's gonna to be areas that you have apts。

 I want you to think about this for tomorrow， that you have aptitudes or energies that you have in your body that are naturally there And if you cultivate them you will be a0 out of 10 version of that。

 and that is where you get a lot of money to get a lot of money。

 you've got to have something that other people don't have because my teaching is unique。

 you've got to understand I can charge anything for it。 If I want to charge $60000 for the seminar。

 I can fill it at 60000。😡，Does that surprise you？This same four day seminar， I can get 60K for this。

😡，I'm not saying this to guilt trip you。 I love that you're here。

How would I do it for anybody here that knows marketing。

 how could I get 60k for the seminar to show they're not BS in this， how would I do it？😡。

Anyone knows marketing， tell me scarcity。Why are you use a bit of scarcity？😡。

But I have to take it further， what else？😡，Urgency， what else？Find the right way。

Fighting the right client。 Let me ask you this。 Do you think that I have 100 clients that are rich。

If I charge $1，000 for the seminar， are they willing to attend it？😡，They're not。

 So I've got to put up the price。 Then I've got to just get the exposure for it by putting up videos。

 I've got to explain that this is a very exclusive group。

And then I just do a couple little tweaks where like， you know， I run it。

 I run it in like a more upscale。 Then you， you know。

 maybe I run it in Sedona at the Enchantment resortsort where， you know。

 there's a bunch of mostly just a bunch of rich people there， right， But to run it there。

 just cost me a little bit more。 But then I just got 60 times the money for that same seminar。

So it really is just the sales material And from there niche marketing it。 Okay， by the way。

 if you want to be the person who only dates models。

 you can niche yourself as the person that only dates models。 You can do that。

 And then you put the price tag there。 And then what happens is the models will start chasing after you。

 You can do that that's not really my thing。 But I'm just saying like， I could teach you to do that。

 You can niche yourself to anything。😡，Literally anything。 you can niche yourself to it。

 If you want to niche yourself as the person who helps rich people， you can niche yourself as that。

 And then you can play to that crowd by catering to that crowd and making a direct energetic connection to them。

 Do you understand that part of what I'm doing with you is I have a direct energetic connection to you。

😡，The reason why you're here is because you feel that I will engage you on a very deep level。

 You're here for the engagement。 You feel that I get you。

 that I engage with you that I want to connect to you that I want to help you。

 You feel that I understand your predicament well and that I want to take you through that process。

 So understand this is the kind of stuff that we're gonna be building in marketing is knowing what kind of energy you have。

 what kind of core strength that you have auditing yourself and then understanding other people。

 how they feel， what's driving you and then connectinged moving them Okay and I want you to be able to do this on a very very deep level。

 I'm going to show you this on a level that no marketing teachershir can show this to you where you're gonna to need about 5 or 10% of what the typical marketer needs to create huge movement at huge sales。

😡，Okay， so， yeah， because I'm gonna show it to you on a deep level that virtually nobody understands because they haven't。

 they haven't had that experience。 remember that when I've gone out and worked on my social skills。

 when I've gone out and done that， I'm literally walking up to person after person， after person。

 after person， attempting to engage。 So because I've done hundreds of thousands of these approaches and attempt to engage。

 I understand very clearly because I've done so many product launches because remember。

 I'm not just doing my own product launches。 I'm running the product launches for my team and for people who you don't know that I work with。

 So because of that。🎼I'm just used to creating massive engagement。

 so I will show you how to get very deep engagement。

 I will show it how to get deep into your own head and deep into somebody else's head。 Okay。

 now everybody stand up and stretch。 We're gonna go into our exercise and thing。
