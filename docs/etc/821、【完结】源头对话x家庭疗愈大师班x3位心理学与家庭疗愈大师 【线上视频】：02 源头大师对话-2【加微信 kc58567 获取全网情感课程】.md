He presented the evidence。That。Sexual abuse and physical abuse was rampant in the Vienese society。

他当时直接在那篇论文当中提出了证据来说明当时的维也纳肆虐整个社会的充斥整个社会的有对儿童的虐待、身体的虐待、性的虐待。

He was expelled from the Vienne P psychiatric Society。于是呢他就被驱逐了，从维也纳精神病学社群里被驱逐了。

And he remained silent for about 10 years。接下来的10天左右，他都保持沉默。And then， he published a paper。

Proposing that it was the child's sexual fantasies about the parent， not the actual abuse。

接下来他发表了一篇论文，提议那些是儿童对于父母施加性虐待的幻想。并没有真正的发生过那些性虐待。So he took the whole field of psychology away from the problem of violence。

于是呢他把整个心理学的领域从暴力问题那里带出来了。And into the intra psychic。Sexual desires of a child。带入到儿童内在世界的性幻想。欲望的幻想。

Psychology stayed in that for about 100 years。然后呢，差不多有100年的时间，心理学就一直停留在了那里。

And now we know that Freud's first theory was the true one。而现在我们知道了，弗洛伊德最初提出来的那一个理论才是真相。

That the problem at the origin of mental problems is violence and abuse。精神问题的起源，它的源头来自于虐待和暴力。

And the general problem in society is violence and abuse。而且社会当中一般性的问题也出在暴力和虐待。

It has nothing to do with the child's fantasies。和一个儿童有些什么样的幻想没有关系。

It has to do with the abuse of people in power towards the less powerful。而是那些更有力量，更有权力的人，对不那么有力量。

有权利的人的虐待。And to this day， we're still hoping to be able to overcome and help people to overcome these dramas。

时至今日，我们仍然很希望能够帮助这些人协助他们从创伤当中恢复过来。So thank you。 Thank you very much， Jeff。

 I'm interested in your thoughts。😊，所以非常感谢jeff我也对你怎么想很感兴趣。😊。

There's no one in the psychotherapy field who explored family violence and how to approach it therapeutically as much as Chloe。

在整个心理治疗领域，没有任何一个其他的治疗师，像Ce一样，如此深入广泛的去研究家庭治疗当中要该要去如何应对暴力和虐待。

I hope that she's invited back to speak specifically about how do you treat violence within families？

我很希望你们可以再次把他邀请回来，邀请他来讲一讲如何去治疗家庭当中存在暴力情况。 And a point is that it's not that the child is it's not that the parent or the child is a bad apple。

重点在于，并不是说这个家里面出了一个坏人，这个大人或者这个小孩是坏人。 It's a matter of rearranging the apple cart。而是在于怎么样去重新整合。

重新整理这辆苹果车。I'm really interested in this idea of a systemic perspective。我真的对系统性的视角非常的感兴趣。

And especially because we tend to think about individuals。尤其是因为我们倾向于以个体作为视角去思考。

And we don't easily think about the effect of others on our behavior。

所以我们就不是那么容易可以去想到其他人对我们的行为会产生什么样的影响 the effect of context。以及背景会带来什么影响？

 Let me give you an example of a systemic perspective。我来给你们举一个系统视角的例子。We're going back to 1980。

让我们回到1980年代。I made a visit to Philadelphia。当时我去费城拜访， I wanted to learn from a great family therapist。

 Carll Whititaker。当时我想要去费城向car威ker，一个伟大的家庭治疗师学习， someone who was well known to both Chloe and myself。

是 Chloe以及我都非常熟悉的一个人。 along with Chloe， one of the leading developers of family therapy。

他和loy一起都是家庭治疗当中领军士的人物。As a guest， I was allowed to attend a class。🤧当时我作为作为一个课座嘉宾，可以去听课。

 in know order to go to that class。You had to be a family therapist for 15 years。嗯，为了要能够去上那堂课。

你首先得要具备15年的家庭治疗经验。There were not many students who were family therapists for 15 years in 1980。

而在1980年的时候，还没有那么多有15年家庭治疗经验的治疗师。Dr。 Whititaker was going to see a family。对，当时早呃威德克博士将要去接待一个家庭。

It was an adolescent schizophrenic。这个家庭有一个青少年患上了精神分裂症， came from the hospital ward。被关进了精神病房。

With members of his family。所以这个少年和他的一家人都来到了现场， and they sat in the middle of the circle。

他们嗯周围的治疗师呢围坐一圈，家庭坐在中间， students satAT around them。学生们学员们围坐围绕着他们坐着， watching Dr。

 Whititaker do the interview with the family。观察威克尔博士怎样跟这个家庭做干预。And shortly into the interview。

在访谈不久之后。Would if they fell asleep？我立刻就睡着了。Now the schizophrenic boy is talking crazy。而。

接下来呢有精神分裂症的男孩就很很疯狂的说话， The family is terribly anxious about being observed。而全家人又极其的焦虑，因为周围这么多人在观察着。

Witfer wakes up and continues the interview。我立克醒了过来，继续那个访谈。A little while later。

 he falls asleep again。过了一小会儿之后，他又睡着了。The father confronts him。父亲跟他对峙 and says， doctor。

 what are you doing？他说医生，你在做什么？😡，And Dr。 Whitakker says， oh， I always fall asleep when I get anxious。

我对他说哦，每当我感到焦虑的时候，我总是会睡着的。A little while later， in the interview。又访谈了一会儿之后。

He falls asleep a third time。那第三次睡着了。And he tells the family a dream。然后他跟这家人讲了一个梦。

And the dream seems relevant to the family dynamic。而且这个梦似乎和他们家庭的动力有某种关联。Gradually。

 the schizophrenic boy stopped speaking crazy。渐渐的这个精神分裂症的男孩就不再很疯狂的讲话了。

 the family becomes a cohesive unit。这个家庭也变得更加的凝聚，更更。At the end of the interview。

 they hugged after Whitakker。在这个访谈结束的时候，他们拥抱了威itaker医生， and they leave the interview arm and arm。

他们是手挽着手离开那次访谈的。Me and the other students don't understand what happened。我和当时在场的其他学生都不太理解，究竟发生了什么。

Why did everything work out so well？为什么一切都进展的如此的良好？ and Whittaker was a system thinker。

而 Whititaker呢是一个系统式的思考者。 He said that craziness only occupies one space in a social system。他说。

在一个社会系统当中，疯狂只在其中占据着一个位置。If the doctor acts crazy。如果医生表现的很疯狂， the family has a choice。那么家庭就有了选择。

 their most likely of choice is to act more sane。他们最有可能会去选的就是他们表现的更正常一些。

 Now that was an introduction to systemic thinking in family therapy。那就是在家庭治疗之之中使用系统思维的一个引入课程。

That rather than giving the family information与其直接给这个家庭信息。

Rather than insisting that the child is medicated。与其坚持要求这个孩子去用药。

The reorientation happened in a way that was basically invisible。重新定向基本上是在一种隐形的看不见摸不着的方式拉生格。

The doctor occupied a social role。由医生去占据某一个社会角色， and that allowed the family to become cohesive。

这就使得那个家庭变得更加的凝聚。 and at the time in 1980。当时是1980年。I was still thinking about individuals。

在那个时候我还是以个体为思维取向的， and it was hard for me to understand systemic forces。其那当时的我很难理解系统中的力量。

We are influenced by things that we don't necessarily understand。我们受到那些我们不见得能够理解的事情的影响。

Systems have a way of being self organizing。系统有一种自我组织的方式。And this is true in the animal kingdom。

而且在动物的王国也是这样的。You don't need leadership for fish to join together in a school。为了让鱼群以一个群体的形式去游动。

你并不需要鱼群当中存在任何一个领袖。You don't need leadership for cows to herd。你也不需要牛群有任何的领袖。

This is programmed into our sociobiological system。这些在我们的社会生物系统当中早就定下程序了。Now。

 another reflection on the Whitaker case。通过viker的那个案例，我还有另外一个思考。

Is that therapy can be an unusual conversation。就是治疗可以是一场非同寻常的对话。If it's a normal conversation。

如果这两个是普通的兑换， you can have it with your friends and relatives。你可以跟朋友跟亲戚之间进行普通的对话。

 but therapy is an unusual conversation。但心理治疗是非同寻常的对话。And it can also use arousal states。

同时也可以去使用一些唤嗯唤起的状态。 We don't have to be gentle and kind。我们不是一定要非常的温柔，非常的和善。

你 can be unusual and evocative。我们也可以是很不寻常的，有一些刺激性的。

And people like Chloe have paved the way for interventions that address family systems。像Cloe这样的先驱。

为家庭治疗当中的系统性干预铺下铺下了道路 and demonstrate that unusual novelty can stimulate growth。也已经展示出了这种非同寻常的新颖的方法。

可以激活成长。We don't have much time。我们时间不多 I'm sorry that we don't have more time to interact， Chloe。

也很抱歉啊，chloe，我们没有那么多的时间来互动。We're just getting started。我们刚刚开始。So。

 but maybe there are some questions from people in the audience。也许听众席各位有一些问题想问。

And we can honor them by answering to the best of our ability。所以我们可以。以自己最好的回答来荣耀他们。来尊重他们。

如果大家有问题想提问两位老师，在这个难得的机会提问的话，请在你们的电脑上面的回应那个地方有个举手的键。OK我看到有一些朋友们举手了呃，请打开视频，请打开视频，我们会有打开视频的那位小伙伴，然后来。

OK我现在看到有两位小伙伴开的视频呃。😊，Jan carries1。Machine is inviting whoever has questions to turn on their videos and speak up。

How much time do we have。我们有多长时间呀？呃，不到10分钟。Less than 10 minutes。黄老师或者你觉得呢？我们我们可以用15分钟来回答问题OK。

And also because we won't have time to answer all of the questions。

Miel was saying you can spend 15 minutes on answering questions。

Then if we still have more questions than time。If you if the questioners send the questions to Mike。

I can answer questions by video next week and we can send it to the attendees。嗯，那可能今天我们没有办法回答所有的问题。

如果还有更多的问题回答不完呢，世明老师也许也可以把这些问题收集起来发给我。这样下一周我以视频的形式来回答一些。Okay， thank you。Yeah。好，刚才那位同学姓点名的同学。

请你打开你的麦问问题。你好呃，是我吗？你。哎，我真没我想老师们你好，呃，我想提个问题，就是就是呃我小孩今年初二，然后呢，他有一年没有上学了，休学在家里。嗯，就是他目前的状态就是出门，他不敢出门。

他很怕同学们看见他没有上学，然后就。二百佢而家唔多。To。Yes。🎼，🎼But I害怕。他是男孩还是女孩啊？女uhai I have a daughter。

 second year of middle school， and she has been suspended just being pausing in her study for one year。

Not for a year， she didn't go to school。 So now the problem is she's afraid of going leaving home because she's afraid her classmates might see her and she felt would feel very embarrassed to meet them on the street。

So questions like this are very important。这样的问题是非常重要的。

And there's not one piece of advice that either Chloe or I could give that would necessarily solve this。

而且无论是Cloe还是我都没有办法做到，就给你一个建议，就一定可以把你面临的这个问题解决掉。Shame can be paralyzing。修耻感可能是会有嗯平行线的。

就有平行线就 also be a game。同时呢羞耻感也可以是一个游戏啊，羞耻感会让人瘫痪。 You and your daughter can play a game。

那你跟女儿可以来玩一个游戏呃呃 shaming呃。Objects or animals in the family。比如说去羞辱家里面的某一样东西或者某一个小动物。So。

 let's play the shame game。就我们来玩一个羞耻游戏。And let's make the cat ashamed of its behavior。

比如说我们让这只猫为它自己的某些行为感到羞耻。And rather than being a victim of shame。那么不再继续处在羞耻的受害者的位置。

就 become a perpetrator of shame。你反而成为了令别人感到羞耻的一个加害者。But in a benign way。但是是以一种善意的方式。

Let's shame our ancestors， who have died。让我们令我们已经过世的祖先的能修。And it makes it inconvenient to have shame。

这就让拥有羞耻感这件事情变得很不方便。 And the idea would be to go into the situation。

那个理念就在于进入到那个情景当中 and increase shame。增加羞耻感。Until the child gets。Sick of it。直到这个小孩子就觉得觉得受够了。

 the child knows that the child has power。而且小孩子也意识到自己是有力量的。

By virtue of the child's emotional position。这个力量来自于他自己处在情感上的什么位置。And if you play this game。

如果你跟他玩这个游戏。And make it a little annoying。老时让这个游戏有点烦人。

 It may have a an effect in disrupting the crystallized position。也许就会起到搅动，它现在已经很清晰的那个位置的作用。

It's a principle of going into the problem。这个原则叫做进入到这个问题之中， increasing the problem。增加这个问题。

And allowing change to happen more naturally。也允许改变更加自然的发生， rather than doing the logical thing。

而不是去做那些很合逻辑的事。 just the child go to school。比如说坚持要求孩子去上学。Now。

 Chloe may have a completely different way of orienting to that type of problem ahead。thank you。

那cloloe也许在处理这个问题上会有很不一样的方法。So let me ask you， how old is the child。我来问你一下，你女儿几岁了？

How old is your looks like her image is frozen， but usually in China。

 the second year of middle school can be 14，13，15 around that age。

And why was she expd from the school？他为什么没有去上学呀？Her image is frozen。娟还在吗？你的画面冻住了。没事，你可以在聊天对话框板答案写出来。

老师问他为什么不去上学了？Can you translate。Yeah， I did。 It looks like her Internet was。The， Okay， she's gone。

 okay。Okay。So。I would。I don't know why the child was not going to school。But the matter needs。

their mother needs to get the collaboration of the school to make this child special。

OhShe answered in the chat。 She said the daughter felt excluded in the classroom， bull。Okay。

Excluded why。为什么的牌子呀？She felt the classmate were他觉得他成绩不好，他之前是把自己就是定义为成绩很好的那种。然后有一次考试的时候呢，呃他考的中等。

但是老师按名次排位置的话，给他安排排在倒数第二个选选位置，他就觉得他是很差的。然后他认为他自己很差，就没有同学跟他玩。

She used to believe that she studies very well， but there was one examination that she only got a mediocre mark and。

Teacher arranges seats， according to their marks。And although she's the middle level。

 but she was arranged at the second last one to choose her seat。

 So she felt the teacher was against her。So she didn't want to go to school or the school didn't want her。

所以是他自己不想去上学，还是学校不许他去上学呀？他自己不想去。She didn't want to go to schools。So now she wants to go to school。

那么现在他想去了吗？他很想去，但是他就是因为害怕呃，就是害怕以前的同学看到他，他就不敢去。She wants to。 And also。

 she's afraid meeting her classmates。 So she doesn't dare to go to school。Okay。

 so the mother can help her。To do something Very special and kind。😊。

For the other students in the school。请妈妈可以帮助女儿，通过对女儿班级里的那些同学为他们去做一些很特别的嗯表达善意，吧表达友好的事情来帮助女儿。

So she will be the girl that brings little presents for the other children。哎，这个女孩。

你的女儿可以带一些小礼物去学校送给同学。行，这个是以前休学了。Yeah。他目前休学了，然后下一届就要放初二，但是中间我有跟他换学校，他也不愿意去，就是不敢去，就很害怕，很紧张。他已经转学了是吗？

没有转我我中间也跟他办过转学，但是他也不敢去新的学校。Sure。没有转学，但是你办过转学。对他也不敢去学校。

 I've tried to help her by transferring her to another school。 I've already arranged everything。

 but she didn't dare to go to the new school， so she didn't。Alright， I think it's important。

For you to convey to the child， she has to go to school。It's an home age。

 she just has to go to school and you will help her。

 and maybe what you have to do is go to school with her and sit with her in school。那么你得要向他解释明白。

让他理解去上学是他的义务，并不是一个可选项，所以他一定要去做的。但是呢你也非常愿意去帮助他。所以也许在最开始复学的那些日子，你可以陪着他一起去，甚至可以陪他在教室里面坐一做。

Can a reward for her every day she goes to school， Something special。然后每一天呢，如果他去上学，你为他准备一些很特别的东西。

作为一个奖励。But I think she's worried about you。 And what are you doing if she's in school。但我在想。

也有可能他是在担心你，担心，如果他自己回去上学了，你在家里会做什么？Could you be in danger if she's not with you。如果他不在家里陪你，你可能会遇上什么危险吗？

Is there a problem between you and your husband？你跟先生之间有什么问题吗？嗯，以前以前会以前感情就有有时候会经常吵吵闹闹的，现在好很多了。

In the past， we argue and fought a lot， but now much better。

The point somebody is making is really important。乐意在讲的这一点相当的重要。

You can think about problems as existing inside one person。你既可以认为问题出在一个人身上。

 problemble is the child shame。问题出在小孩子有羞耻感上面， you can think about the problem is existing among people。

您也可以把问题视为它出在人人之间。You can think about problems existing within the family。您可以把问题视为它是出生出现在家庭里面。

You can think about problems as existing in the way in which the family and the institution interact。

你可以把这个问题视为出在家庭和学校之间的互动是吧？ there's no right way to think about human problems。不存在某一种单一的正确的理解问题的方式。

there are many entry points。有很多不同的入口。And what Chloe is doing， we could call reframing。诺刚刚在做的。

我们可以称之为换框。Or redefining。或者重新下定义。That that the childs symptom。这样喊子的症状。

Conserve a function in redirecting the energy between the parents。可能这个症状的功能就在于让父母的精力可以转移的焦点。

And that is typical of Chloe's thinking。而且Cloe这是非常典型的Cloe的思维方式 and is a principle that can be added to the list that Chloe provided。

也是可以添加在刚刚Cloe所提到的那一个一系列原则当中去的又一个原则。Understand the systemic function of a problem。理解这个问题，在系统当中的功能。

 address the systemic function。去处理这个系统性的功能。Not just what's happening within the individual。

而不只是去看这个个体身上在发生着什么。 This is an interesting case。就是一个很有意思的案例。

And allows Chloe and I to highlight differences in how we would think。这使得我和Cloe可以去强调我们各自的观点。

以及我们观点之中的不同。There really isn't a right way。真的不存在只有一种正确方式。

And we can't get enough information to really be helpful。而且我们也可以去不可能完全获得充分的信息来提供帮助。

 But talking about this case allows us to highlight different ways of thinking。但通过谈论这样的案例呢。

就可以让我们去呈现不同的思维的角度。I'm afraid we're running out of time。恐怕我们今天的时间问答的时间要到这儿。

And what should say one thing， one thing， one thing。 Okay， so when a child behaves like this。😊。

The first thing that I will think I would think is who is the child protecting when the child doesn't go to school。

 Where is the child with the mother。 She's protecting the mother from what I don't know。

 So you have to make sure that the child doesn't need to protect you， And for that。

 you have to improve your relationship with your husband or your family。

 I don't know with whom the child senses danger。我想要再补充一点啊，就是当一个儿童的行为出现了问题的时候，很有可能他通过出现的这个问题。

在试图保护着他想要去保护的那个人。那这个时候你就可以问问自己，这个孩子想要保护的是谁呢？当他不去学校上学，他在家里面陪伴的那个人是谁呢？陪伴的是母亲吗？那么他想要保护母亲，避免什么呢？

也许是避免母亲跟父亲之间发生某种冲突，或者是母亲遇到的其他的问题，所以你需要去做的就是思考这些，然后确保你的孩子不再需要留在家里来保护你，你自己去处理好你有问题的那些关系。

于是孩子就可以自由的回学校上学了。Alright， thank you。We take a break now。我们现在是茶歇吗？是的，呃，我们休息5分钟呃，然后一会回来就是coy老师的环节。

听 you thank可以。Thank you， both。 And shall we take five minutes tea break， and after the tea break。

 it'll be closed floor to give a lecture。😊，Yes， thank you。 Thank you。Thanks，Thank you。 Thank you。

 Thank you， Jeff。 Great to see you。 Thank you。😊，好的，谢谢，一会儿见。😊。
