Commanment 3Ôºå thou shalt open like you mean it„ÄÇSo in this sectionÔºå we're talking about opening„ÄÇ

 starting an interaction with a woman„ÄÇ NowÔºå I know that opening is one of the main things that new guys worry about and is one of the biggest sources of anxiety for someone starting off this process„ÄÇ

 So my goal for this section is for everyone listening to never again say that they don't know how to open„ÄÇ

 We are going to talk about this in a very structured and complete way going over frames how to get over approach anxiety De„ÄÇ

 et cetera„ÄÇ So a few things to understand about opening„ÄÇ FirstÔºå I want to say this„ÄÇ

 A lot of people will focus so much on the opener that they will do it to the exclusion of other parts of their game„ÄÇ

 So they will try and think of themselvesÔºå What is the best way to start an interaction„ÄÇ

 what do I sayÔºå What do I originally sayÔºå The thing is„ÄÇ

 the opener is really only about 2% of the total interaction„ÄÇ

 What is more important than the opener is what's called follow through„ÄÇ So you'll see these„ÄÇ

uys that get into this game„ÄÇ They'll go out and they thought of all of these openers thinking about what is the perfect opener„ÄÇ

 and then they will say one of them„ÄÇ and you know it'll work„ÄÇ the girl will respond„ÄÇ

 But then after thatÔºå they have no follow through„ÄÇ They have no idea what to do next and we are going to get into what to do next„ÄÇ

 VeryÔºå very detailedÔºå but do not fall into this trap of thinking that you just have to think of an opener that the opener is some big important thing„ÄÇ

 It's not is simply the start of the interaction„ÄÇ So first things first„ÄÇ

 understanding where the opener is in these structure of game„ÄÇ

 So when people first start writing about success with women„ÄÇ

 They would make these incredibly complicated structures„ÄÇ

 they would have letters and numbers in them and they would have exactly what to do in every situation but the problem is that a real interaction is organic and does not work in a predictable fashion„ÄÇ

 So when I talk about the structure of game„ÄÇ What I want is for you to get an idea of how the average successful interaction with the women goes„ÄÇ

What type of goals you need to have at each point and how it generally works for guys that are very good at this„ÄÇ

 So what is the structureÔºå WellÔºå I think of it in three simple parts„ÄÇ First partÔºå you versus me„ÄÇ

 Second partÔºå you and me question mark„ÄÇThird partÔºå you and I together„ÄÇ So the first part„ÄÇ

 you versus me„ÄÇ That is where you are exerting who you are„ÄÇ You are talking a lot„ÄÇ

 You are exerting your frame and is generally a showcase of who you are and you are not sold at all„ÄÇ

 on who the girl is„ÄÇ You are just trying to give her a sample size of your personality„ÄÇ

 This goes on for anywhere from a couple of minutes to maybe 10 or 15 minutes„ÄÇ Second part„ÄÇ

 you and meÔºå This is where you are discovering if she is the right girl for you„ÄÇ

 you are asking a few questions about her„ÄÇ She is now compelled by you and trying to sell herself„ÄÇ

 This is where you are kind of figuring out if this is the right girl for you„ÄÇ

 And this part is super important because a lot of guys will just go up and be likeÔºå heyÔºå I like you„ÄÇ

 I like you„ÄÇ I like you„ÄÇ Well ever getting to know the girl and the girl has no fucking interest in a guy that is interested in her without actually having any standards„ÄÇ

 Third partÔºå you and I together„ÄÇ This is when she is now attracted to you„ÄÇ

 You are now attracted to her and you are focused on having„ÄÇüò°ÔºåFun together and building a connection„ÄÇ

 So there are three signpost that make up the structure of game„ÄÇ

 and that is generally how any successful interaction with a woman goes„ÄÇ In fact„ÄÇ

 if you watch romantic comediesÔºå you can kind of see the structure playing out throughout the plot„ÄÇ

 Guy and girl meet„ÄÇ They don't really like each other they both have very strong opinions and personalities„ÄÇ

 then they start to discover that they have shared values„ÄÇ

 that is all you need to know about the overall structure of game„ÄÇ Don't overthink it more than that„ÄÇ

 Next partÔºå hesitation and approach anxiety„ÄÇ Most guys that are new and most guys in general get somewhat nervous when they're about to go talk to a girl„ÄÇ

 This is an evolutionary thingÔºå we don't need to get into why that happens„ÄÇ

 but it does happen for most people„ÄÇ and you need to know how to overcome that„ÄÇ

 Even when you're advanced„ÄÇ you no longer get that approach anxiety„ÄÇ However„ÄÇ

 a lot of times you'll feel an initial resistance because it takes energy to go and meet a new person„ÄÇ

 It's no longer anxiety„ÄÇ It's laziness„ÄÇ So firstÔºå why is it important„ÄÇ

To handle your approach anxiety and not hesitate„ÄÇ WellÔºå number one„ÄÇ

 we see on boot camp all the time where we will tell guys to go into an interaction and they will either just stand there„ÄÇ

 they will hesitateÔºå they will make up really dumb excuses or even worse„ÄÇ

 they will go walk up near her and then just not do anything and just stand around„ÄÇ

 So when we finally actually get them into that interaction„ÄÇ

 the anxiety is built up so much in their mind that they are stifled and they can't actually express themselves„ÄÇ

 you want to be in a state where you are free flowing where your personality is to the forefront and so learning to not hesitate is paramount„ÄÇ

 NowÔºå I'm gonna give you a bit of an example of what happens when you don't approach when you're advanced„ÄÇ

 I was with my friend Michael who you will hear an interview with later in Las Vegas a couple weeks ago„ÄÇ

 And me and MichaelÔºå when we are outÔºå we are usually almost pushing each other over to make sure that we are the person that approaches first„ÄÇ

 because it's fun because we want to go talk to the hot girl because this is„ÄÇ

Such an enjoyable activity for us that hesitation is usually the last thing on our mind„ÄÇ Now„ÄÇ

 we walk into the club and we go to the outside areaÔºå and we're talking to each other„ÄÇ

 and we both sort of turn towards the bar to see who's there As we are turning I see this girl who at least body type is almost my perfect 10„ÄÇ

 and for just a secondÔºå I hesitate and then start walking after like a millisecond„ÄÇ

 Michael had saw her a second before me and is now walking towards her„ÄÇ

 So he gets to her first and because of my millisecond of hesitationÔºå I do not get to her first„ÄÇ

 So Michael starts talking to her interaction goes really well„ÄÇ and he ends up taking her home„ÄÇ Now„ÄÇ

 this girl physicallyÔºå I never got to know her personality wise„ÄÇ

 but physically was pretty much my perfect 1„ÄÇ And so this was kind of a painful experience for me because obviously she was receptive to meeting someone„ÄÇ

 I probably would have gotten the same result that Michael got„ÄÇ And so for an advanced guy„ÄÇ

 it's shaving those milliseconds off of your he„ÄÇüòäÔºåNow I've gotten other girls that have been in my perfect ten as well„ÄÇ

 So it's not like this was a huge dealÔºå but it did remind me how important it is not to hesitate„ÄÇ

 I could have been with that girlÔºå but instead I had to wing him and get rid of her or or friend„ÄÇ

 So how do we actually decrease that hesitation and decrease that approach anxiety„ÄÇ Well„ÄÇ

 let's understand the approach anxiety firstÔºå there's two parts to it„ÄÇ

 number one is overcoming that initial resistance when you're approaching number two is getting rid of that after approach residue where you didn't get the response you wanted and now you feel all bad about it„ÄÇ

 and the next time you approach you're associating approaching with pain and not having fun„ÄÇ

 So firstÔºå overcoming that initial resistance„ÄÇ you have to understand that our brain is constantly oscillating through two different modes„ÄÇ

 One is a defensive mentality„ÄÇ This is where our sympathetic nervous system is turned on We are looking for threats„ÄÇ

 we are looking for anything that might fight us we are feeling anxious etc„ÄÇ The other is„ÄÇ

Discovery mentalityÔºå This is where we are looking for opportunitiesÔºå things that will be fun„ÄÇ

 things that will enhance our lives„ÄÇ and our brain is constantly going through these two phases„ÄÇ

 And once you become aware of thisÔºå you can see that our brain is constantly going through these two phases at any given time throughout the day So how do we get our brain into discovery mode as opposed to defensive mode„ÄÇ

 Once you become aware of how often your brain is in this defensive mode you will be fucking shocked is in that defensive mode much„ÄÇ

 much more than how you would like„ÄÇ and it is in that discovery mode much less than would be ideal„ÄÇ

 So how do we get into that discovery mode when we're actually out A general rule if you're new is that when you're in the club„ÄÇ

 you should start approaching right away or start having fun with your friends right away that get you into that lighthearted mode tells your brain this is a context in which I can be social and not get hurt and generally makes the opportunities of the night more real to you than the potential downsides of the night now„ÄÇ

I know some people recommends that you should approach all Now what Derek will do that is massively better is that he will approach all that he is attracted to so when you're approaching all your brain is in a bit of that discovery mode but it's not really seeing the rewards because you're talking to people that you don't even actually like you don't envision any real future with these people and you don't have anything in common with them so really you're just talking to them to talk to them as some sort of weird self-help exercise when you approach everything that you are attracted to your brain is being primed for that discovery mode your brain is being primed for that discovery mode so that you're attaching massive upside to every move that you make The reason a lot of time people become approach machines is because they're subconsciously trying to keep their brain in that discovery mode Now the way Derek does it is that you will be they're having fun with friends doing something he's enjoy or just approaching all of those girls make sure that you don't get caught all night just having fun with your friends„ÄÇ

But it is a completely viable way to get into that discovery mode to have friends around„ÄÇ

 to be joking with them„ÄÇ And then when you see a girl not hesitating and just going up to her immediately„ÄÇ

 Next part of overcoming initial resistance„ÄÇ Stop making meaning out of things„ÄÇ

 I see this all the time on boot camp„ÄÇ We will push a guy to go talk to a girl„ÄÇ

 And he will automatically become an expert in those other people's lives„ÄÇ OhÔºå she's not interested„ÄÇ

 That guy's her boyfriend„ÄÇ Ba things will happen„ÄÇ She doesn't look like she's looking for any„ÄÇ

 E ceteraÔºå et ceteraÔºå et cetera„ÄÇNowÔºå I want you to think about your chosen profession and how often people who speculate about that profession are frequently wrong„ÄÇ

 I know for my professionÔºå most people outside of that profession that just have random wild opinions on the details of that usually have no idea what they're talking about„ÄÇ

 And so I will explain to these bootcm students is„ÄÇ

 The chances of you being an expert in that person's life is about the chance of someone who is never read a book being an expert in your profession„ÄÇ

 which is0„ÄÇ You are not an expert in these people's lives„ÄÇ people are meaning making machines„ÄÇ

 They will make meaning out of any random stimulus they see and their meaning that they make is usually wrong and based on nothing„ÄÇ

 Go find out for yourself„ÄÇ realize that you are making meaning in things that you are not an expert in and that you actually have no idea what you're talking about„ÄÇ

 NextÔºå video game model„ÄÇ A lot of times what I will tell students is that being out is essentially like a video game„ÄÇ

 Was that mean is that nothing„ÄÇThat happens here is really going to affect their lives and nothing that happens here is really going to affect your life„ÄÇ

So you can have an interaction with someone that doesn't really go that well„ÄÇ Gues what do„ÄÇ

 This girl's not even going to remember that5 minutes later„ÄÇ

 And you are not going to remember that the next day„ÄÇ

 So while it's not a video game as in you can't actually punch someone in the face and expect it not to affect your life„ÄÇ

 It might as well be a video game„ÄÇ Most people in a club or a bar„ÄÇ lookÔºå they're drinking„ÄÇ

 They're having funÔºå They're listening to music„ÄÇ They're dancing„ÄÇ

 They are not ruminating on every person that talks to them„ÄÇ

 So you can think of it almost as a consequencefr zone„ÄÇ

 This does not mean break the law or do anything inappropriate„ÄÇ

 but assuming that you are just going up and talking to peopleÔºå really„ÄÇ

 there are not that many consequences„ÄÇ So think of it almost as a video game„ÄÇ Lastly„ÄÇ

 you can only change an emotion through action„ÄÇ Ill see a lot of guys„ÄÇ

 you will tell them to go approach„ÄÇ and they will just stand there„ÄÇ

 And I know exactly what's going on in their head„ÄÇ They are trying to think their way out of that anxiety that they are feeling„ÄÇ

 but that as impossible„ÄÇ The only way that you can change an emotion is through„ÄÇ

Action so just start walking what I will tell students and what I suggest you do„ÄÇ

 you find yourself in this frozen modeÔºå just concentrate on putting one ft in front of the other„ÄÇ

 And then once you get there you will probably think of something to say next part of getting rid of approach anxiety getting rid of that after approach residue So for this„ÄÇ

 you have to understand how our brain encodes memories because what I will see is a lot of guys in the club they will get into these downward spirals so they will start approaching they will personalize the approach they'll be like oh I got rejected and when they go into the next approach they're feeling negative so obviously they get rejected again and then it's just this like downward spiral the entire night of just awfulness So bear with me at for a second because I'm gonna to talk a little bit about how memories are encoded in your brain and why this happens„ÄÇ

Your memory has two parts„ÄÇ Your shortter memoryÔºå which can hold five to 7 items or things and your longterm memory„ÄÇ

 which attaches thoughts and emotions to any random memory that you have„ÄÇ

 So your short termm memory only really lasts for somewhere between 2 to4 minutes„ÄÇ

 And during that two to4 minutesÔºå we are contextualizing and actually changing that memory and encoding how it is going to be remembered in your longter memoryÔºü

 WellÔºå why is this importantÔºå Because if you have an interaction And then afterwards„ÄÇ

 you are telling yourselfÔºå OhÔºå that went terribleÔºå that was awfulÔºå that was so painful„ÄÇ

 that was the worst thing that's ever happened to meÔºå Well„ÄÇ

 what are you telling your long-term memory about what happens when you approach„ÄÇ Also„ÄÇ

 how are you priming your instincts for later in the night when you want to approach again„ÄÇ

 What you are doing is essentially creating a negative anchor and negative emotions attached to all the right action that you're taking„ÄÇ

 The way to overcome that is to consciously take charge of this memory encoding process„ÄÇ

So how do we do that WellÔºå you give yourself a little reward for the right action that you are taking So let's say that you approach and it's neutral„ÄÇ

 you knowÔºå she needs to go to the bathroom or anythingÔºå which by the way is in a rejection„ÄÇ

 that's just something that happens in a conversation„ÄÇ guysy always say that that's a rejection„ÄÇ

 but you goÔºå you approachÔºå she says oh wellÔºå I need to go to the bathroom and blaÔºå blah„ÄÇ

 blah and you sayÔºå ohÔºå she rejected me blaÔºå blah instead sayÔºå you know what„ÄÇ

 I approached I'm being a boss„ÄÇ I'm awesome„ÄÇ I did the right action„ÄÇ yeah„ÄÇ

 you get that little dopamine hit„ÄÇ you get that little positive connotation attached to that action gets encoded into your longterm memory and now your brain is primed to approach again„ÄÇ

 this seems smallÔºå but I have seen the guys that do this consistently do very„ÄÇ

 very well throughout the night and the guys that don't do this consistently do worse and worse„ÄÇ

A lot of guys like to talk about naturals and why a natural is so good at what he does„ÄÇ Well„ÄÇ

 the reason a natural is so good is because every time he's taking that little action„ÄÇ

 every time he is approachingÔºå he's giving himself positive feedback„ÄÇ So his longter memories„ÄÇ

 all of his long termm memories are either he just doesn't even remember the interaction„ÄÇ

 or is just likeÔºå yeahÔºå that was hilarious„ÄÇ I was being a fucking bossÔºå et ceteraÔºå etc cetera„ÄÇ Now„ÄÇ

 how do we get that longterm winning memory while also not becoming homeless and just thinking everything that we do is great„ÄÇ

 Numb oneÔºå this is a technique that is specific to approaching and specific to the club„ÄÇ

 So if you are fucking up in your real life and doing drugs or something„ÄÇ

 don't just tell yourself you're doing awesome„ÄÇ This is something specifically that will help you get into state„ÄÇ

 that will help you attach positive emotions to approaching and not something that you should necessarily use every time you take an action that doesn't go well„ÄÇ

 Number twoÔºå realize that strategy is something that needs to be thought of later in game„ÄÇ

 If you're constantly thinking about strategyÔºå constantly thinking about ohÔºå what she„ÄÇ

Thinking constantly thinking aboutÔºå ohÔºå did this go wellÔºå Did this go badly„ÄÇ

 What do I need to do different If you're thinking about that stuff in the club„ÄÇ

 you're shooting yourself in the foot because you are getting yourself out of that discovery mode„ÄÇ

 Think about strategy afterwards„ÄÇ Remember when I was talking about learning how to learn„ÄÇ

 We think about what went right and what went wrong afterwards and we focus on long term feedback not necessarily short term feedback„ÄÇ

 Short term feedback should be you rewarding yourself for that approach and will get rid of that after approach„ÄÇ

 residue„ÄÇ NowÔºå we're gonna talk about the general frames of how you want an open to go„ÄÇ number one„ÄÇ

 honesty„ÄÇ This is one of the biggest parts of Derek's boot camp and something that we really hammer home to boot camp students„ÄÇ

 A lot of times your friend will tell youÔºå let's say a line that is worked for you and you'll go up and you'll use that line and won't go anywhere„ÄÇ

 WellÔºå why is that happeningÔºå because she can tell by your subcommunications„ÄÇ

 they're not actually being authentic and actually being honest„ÄÇ

 Let me tell you about how I see honesty„ÄÇ I want„ÄÇEvery person that talks to me in any context in any situation in my life to know exactly who I am within five minutes of meeting me„ÄÇ

 If not thatÔºå I want them to know within a minute of meeting me within 30 seconds of meeting me„ÄÇ

 I want to inject so much of my personalityÔºå my opinions on thingsÔºå my values„ÄÇ

 who I am into the interactions I have with other people that they can either choose to be with me and think I'm awesome or fuck off and go find someone else that is better for them„ÄÇ

 In realityÔºå I view this as doing them a favorÔºå And I wish people did this with me„ÄÇ

 I want someone to be able to self-select in or self-select out And so I've built that honesty muscle very„ÄÇ

 very strongly for myself„ÄÇ And Derek has to„ÄÇ So what does this mean in practicality„ÄÇ

 This means going up saying the first thing that's on your mind what you actually think„ÄÇ

 We will do an exercise on boot camp where we will have each student say three things that are essential really core opinions of theirs that they usually would not say in public and they would usually not say to a stranger„ÄÇ

üò°ÔºåThese are often very unpC thingsÔºå just things that they believeÔºå but maybe no one else believes„ÄÇ

 and I will say three very harsh thingsÔºå Derek will then say three very harsh things and then we'll turn to the students and you know what type of stuff they say they say„ÄÇ

 wellÔºå my honest opinion is that I really love my family„ÄÇFuck you„ÄÇ Everyone loves their family„ÄÇ

 That is not an honest opinion of yours„ÄÇ You are just trying to fit in„ÄÇ Another thing that they do„ÄÇ

 They will actually just repeat what we said our honest opinions„ÄÇ

 but in a way that's different enough to sound like it's their opinion„ÄÇ

 I don't want you to be doing either of these„ÄÇ Do not succ come to just saying things that everyone will agree with and that does not show your personality at all„ÄÇ

 Also do not succumb to just trying to be derekÔºå trying to be Sean„ÄÇ

 because that doesn't work either because it's not actually honest„ÄÇ

 We're going to talk about something called honest signals later„ÄÇ

 but basically girls can tell when you are doing something that is contrived„ÄÇ

 And the way that we deal with that is by doing things that are essential„ÄÇ

 It's the opposite of contrived„ÄÇ So for youÔºå I want you to start writing down what your real opinions are on things„ÄÇ

 What kind of things you actually believe„ÄÇ And then I want you to start saying them in interactions„ÄÇ

 And when someone says their opinionÔºå give your real opinion backÔºå you are doing them a favor„ÄÇ

 I promise you„ÄÇ You are„ÄÇüò°ÔºåAllowing them to either leave and find someone that is better for them or for you guys to really have a strong connection based on authenticity„ÄÇ

Next frameÔºå entitlement„ÄÇNowÔºå a lot of people talk aboutÔºå wellÔºå you know„ÄÇ

 in order to get that really hot girlÔºå you need to feel entitled„ÄÇ And that's true„ÄÇ However„ÄÇ

 I don't think guys realize what entitlement actually means„ÄÇ

 A lot of guys believe that entitlement is this feeling of excitement„ÄÇ

 It's a feeling of going up to her and knowing that you could have her„ÄÇ It's this thought of yes„ÄÇ

 I am awesome„ÄÇ And I deserve this„ÄÇ and I am good enoughÔºå I am strong enoughÔºå blahÔºå blahÔºå blah„ÄÇ

 I'm the best„ÄÇ And this is what I deserve„ÄÇ WellÔºå if you think about the things you actually feel entitled to in life„ÄÇ

 You're really not going through that process at all„ÄÇ think about how you talk to your little sister„ÄÇ

 Think about how you talk toÔºå let's say an employeeÔºå Think about how you talk to a doorman„ÄÇ

 someone you just don't feel anxious around at all„ÄÇ

 I'm willing to bet that Instead of feeling really pumped up„ÄÇ

 you are actually feeling and thinking nothing„ÄÇ when I am talking to a family member that I've seen1 thousand times before„ÄÇ

 I'm talking to my best friend„ÄÇ I'm not really thinking or feeling„ÄÇüòäÔºåAnything„ÄÇ

 And so you have to understand entitlement is actually a lack of feeling is a lack of thought„ÄÇ

 And that is what's going through our minds when we start these interactions„ÄÇ

 So instead of trying to get yourself pumped up or start thinking things about how you deserve her really just allow yourself to realize that this is a situation that is not gonna affect your life and that there's really not anything to feel or think about„ÄÇ

 you're just walking up to someone that is your equal next frame„ÄÇ

 a lot of guys go out and they have this intense prerogative in their head that they are there to get a girl and what happens„ÄÇ

 WellÔºå they get approach anxiety because you know they're not doing their stated goal or they will go talk to a girl and will come off as just kind of needy it will come off as like a little bit more full on and essentially they will just have a very unfn night They'll feel approach anxiety„ÄÇ

 their opens won't go anywhere„ÄÇ reallyÔºå the frame that you should be having when you go out for the night is that youre just there to see what kind of fun you can have„ÄÇ

 You're just there to fuck„ÄÇTo socializeÔºå to muse yourself„ÄÇ

 to tell jokes just to see what kind of mischief you can get yourself into on that particular night when you take a bit of that prerogative out of the equation and just make it about having fun and that is actually a big realization I had I realize that when I'm there to work on talking to girls know nothing really fucking happens when I'm there to just like go out and have fun and I just don't even care tonight and I'm just gonna joke around with my friends I'm still gonna take the action you have to have that part of the equation„ÄÇ

 but I'm really just there to have fun fuck around those are the nights when I do the best„ÄÇüò°„ÄÇ

So remember to not make this too serious of a task„ÄÇ

 Girls really don't give a shit about your selfhelp journey„ÄÇ know„ÄÇ

 they don't give a shit about what your goals are„ÄÇ They just want someone to have fun with„ÄÇ

 And if you can have fun and just have kind of this carefree irreverent attitude„ÄÇ

 Your approaches will go a lot better„ÄÇ Next frame„ÄÇ First five minutes is all about offering value„ÄÇ

 or I think a better phrase and offering value is just expressing value„ÄÇ

 Off value is something that can get rejected„ÄÇ expressing value is really something that is just going everywhere„ÄÇ

 You're just expressing it to the entire world„ÄÇ Was this mean„ÄÇ Well„ÄÇ

 there's that old adage that you have to do 90% of the talking first five minutes„ÄÇ

 I think that's very true„ÄÇ The other part of it is just expressing yourself to the hilt„ÄÇ having fun„ÄÇ

 and then making sure that you are not going up and expecting her to carry the conversation and her to add energy to the conversation in the first five minutes„ÄÇ

 Last frame of openingÔºå cutting out unnecessary logic„ÄÇ

 You have to remember that you are speaking to the person within the person you are talking to„ÄÇ

 What that mean„ÄÇWellÔºå you' are not speaking to their neocortex„ÄÇ

 which is the part of our brain that makes all the decisions„ÄÇ

 You are speaking to their emotional mindÔºå their amygdalaÔºå their inner lizard brain„ÄÇ

 I have a story about thisÔºå actuallyÔºå that really illustrated this point for me„ÄÇ So I was on a plane„ÄÇ

 actuallyÔºå I think coming back from a boot camp„ÄÇ And I was in the middle seat in one of the rows„ÄÇ

 I remember there was a bro on either side of me just like a really drunken bro guy and then a hot girl on the other side of me„ÄÇ

 And I SAT down basically put my head down to go to sleep„ÄÇ

 because I'd been up for days helping boot camp clients and pulling multiple girls„ÄÇ

 And so basically all I wanted to do on this plane was sleep„ÄÇ So I put my head down„ÄÇ

 And as I was going to sleep„ÄÇ I remember the bro on the other side of me started hitting on the hot girl on the other side of me„ÄÇ

 And the stuff he was saying was just stupid„ÄÇ He'd be likeÔºå heyÔºå how was your trip„ÄÇAnd she'd be like„ÄÇ

 ohÔºå you knowÔºå its fine„ÄÇ He's likeÔºå yeahÔºå that's cool„ÄÇ I had a lot of beer„ÄÇ

 And I remember thinking as I was falling asleep what a fuck retardÔºå this is never going to work„ÄÇ

 So I wake up„ÄÇ I get my stuff and I start walking out of the plane„ÄÇ

 And I look back as I'm walking through the corridor„ÄÇ

 And I see that the guy and the girl are now holding hands and looking at each other in a way that is suggestive that there is romantic things happening„ÄÇ

 And I remember being so surprised because this guy was essentially saying one or two word phrases that had no logic to them whatsoever„ÄÇ

 HoweverÔºå the way that he was saying these thingsÔºå projected confidence projected„ÄÇ

 knowing who he is projectedÔºå not really caring what the girl's response was„ÄÇ

 And so he was able to talk to that inner mindÔºå which is the part of our brain that is responsible for attraction„ÄÇ

 He was able to talk to that inner mind to the girl and eventually make good things happen for him„ÄÇ

 So do not for a secondÔºå think that anything that you say logically is going to„ÄÇThe girl„ÄÇ

 It all has to be focused on that inner part of their brain and focused on their emotions„ÄÇ

 Next part of opening„ÄÇ What do I actually sayÔºå This is the main thing that guys ask of some bootc„ÄÇ

 What do I say when I actually go talk to the girl„ÄÇ WellÔºå why is this guy even asking thisÔºü

 Do you think he has to ask himselfÔºå what do I sayÔºå when he's around his best friend„ÄÇ

 Do you think he has to ask himselfÔºå what do I sayÔºå when he's talking to his little brother„ÄÇ No„ÄÇ

 in that situationÔºå he's just saying exactly what he is thinkingÔºå for each person„ÄÇ

 there is kind of a filter between what they are thinking and what they are speaking„ÄÇ

 When you are around someone that's already accepted youÔºå your best friend„ÄÇ Well„ÄÇ

 that filter is basically nonexistent when you are aroundÔºå let's say your boss or in an interview„ÄÇ

 that filter is pretty goddamn strong„ÄÇ So the habit that we want you to get into„ÄÇ

 I that immediately when you think somethingÔºå you say it„ÄÇ And guess what„ÄÇ

 you're not really going to be able to just pull this out in the club„ÄÇ

 This is something that you're gonna have to be able to do throughout the rest of your life„ÄÇAs well„ÄÇ

 when you think something you say itÔºå when you think something you say itÔºå this has to be a habit„ÄÇ

 And so then when you are thinking aboutÔºå ohÔºå what do I say„ÄÇ

 you no longer have to worry about that little filter thats stifling all of your thoughts because you've already gotten rid of it„ÄÇ

 Another thing with what do I say„ÄÇ I talked earlier about how I want people to know who I am very„ÄÇ

 very quickly„ÄÇ WellÔºå one thing that I saw Deerk do extremely well is what I call sharp ends forward„ÄÇ

 He will actually express the most extreme and the most potent parts of his personality immediately when talking to the girl because he wants her to select in or select out„ÄÇ

 So remember when I was talking about honestyÔºå thinking about the most essential opinions of who you are„ÄÇ

 the darkest jokes„ÄÇ the most non PC opinions„ÄÇ Well„ÄÇ

 you want to put that at the forefront of your games that these people can get to know you immediately„ÄÇ

 You are declaring your intentions from the beginning„ÄÇ A little example„ÄÇ

We were in Minneapolis a couple years ago„ÄÇ and this boot camp student of ours who had talked to maybe five girls in his entire life„ÄÇ

 was telling us that direct game would never work„ÄÇ And he was really convinced of this„ÄÇ

 and trying to lecture us on why this stuff would never work„ÄÇ

 So I figured I'd give them a little bit of an example„ÄÇ

 I went up to a girl and I said something like you and I would make beautiful Jew babies together„ÄÇ

 She starts laughing„ÄÇ she starts cracking up immediately hugs meÔºå We start hanging out„ÄÇ

 He had the same sense of humorÔºå same valuesÔºå ended up going home„ÄÇ

 having a great time together Next dayÔºå I wouldn't talk to Derek„ÄÇ

 He told me that when the student was watching us„ÄÇ and we told them specifically to watch me do this„ÄÇ

 He couldn't even look at meÔºå he had it so in his head that this direct stuff would never work„ÄÇ

 that this honesty stuff would never work„ÄÇ that he couldn't even look at what we were doing„ÄÇ

 And that's the mode that most guys are in„ÄÇ when you go up and you put these sharp parts of your personality first„ÄÇ

 when you say them either immediatelyÔºå you say your intentions immediately„ÄÇ

Or at least put it within the first five minutes„ÄÇ You will get amazing results„ÄÇ Now„ÄÇ

 you don't want to polarize just for the sake of polarizing because that's not actually you„ÄÇ

 And we'll talk about that a little bit later„ÄÇ But you do want to figure out what your favorite jokes are„ÄÇ

 what you think would be most amusingÔºå what your real opinions about the world are„ÄÇ

 And you want to say that immediatelyÔºå those are greatÔºå great openers„ÄÇNextÔºå what do I sayÔºå Well„ÄÇ

 we talked a little bit about that thought speech pipeline„ÄÇ

 a way to decrease that pipeline over time„ÄÇ beside just building that habit is to focus on presence„ÄÇ

 What is presence is just a deep engagement in what you are doing and what you are saying long term„ÄÇ

 That means meditatingÔºå reading books like Ecar told„ÄÇ

 where he talks about really the only access you have your life is the current moment„ÄÇ

 You want to start building that habit and those neural pathways of being present to what you are doing at all times„ÄÇ

 What will this do for youÔºå WellÔºå as I discussed in the last chapterÔºå it will get rid of thinking„ÄÇ

 ohÔºå what could happen bad if I say this and it will stop you from creating those negative memories just saying what you really believe„ÄÇ

 Because you're not contextualizing those memories ofÔºå ohÔºå I said thisÔºå that was bad„ÄÇ

 I'm a bad person„ÄÇ shameÔºå shamemeÔºå shameÔºå because you're not contextualizing those memories„ÄÇ

 you start to not feel anxiety around just free flowing„ÄÇ

 saying exactly what you mean and getting that thought„ÄÇSpeech filter to disappear„ÄÇ

 Last thing on what do I say„ÄÇ So I talked about this a bit in the last chapter„ÄÇ

 But one thing me and my buddy will do is we will write down the things that we thought were most funny„ÄÇ

 Why are we doing this not to impress the girl„ÄÇ But because we know if we look back on those„ÄÇ

 they'll be primed in our headÔºå and then we can go out and get into state quicker„ÄÇ

 So a lot of those things that we find hilarious that we just say off the fly„ÄÇ

 We will then prime them in our head by looking back at themÔºå writing them downÔºå and then over time„ÄÇ

 reallyÔºå you have 50 things off the top of your head that are hilarious that make you laugh that you can say in any interaction„ÄÇ

 NowÔºå let's get into technical stuff„ÄÇ How should it actually look from the outside„ÄÇ Well„ÄÇ

 you know what a good approach looks like„ÄÇüòäÔºåIt looks exactly the same as let's say a guy going up to a group of girls he already knows„ÄÇ

 It looks exactly the same as a person walking back from the bathroom and just going up to their friend„ÄÇ

 In other wordsÔºå doing a direct line to where they are and just start talking to them„ÄÇ

 Do not do this thing where you try and curve around the group like some sort of weird ballistic missile or where you hesitate the way that a good interaction works is really just walking straight up to them„ÄÇ

 That's why we never get called out on quoteÔºå unquoteÔºå Ga„ÄÇ

 because it really just looks like we're just going up to someone we already know„ÄÇ

 In other technical thing„ÄÇ Subcommunications„ÄÇ guyss worry about this a lot„ÄÇ

 And it is actually very important by want to make it clear exactly what good subcommunications look like„ÄÇ

 There are only three things that you have to worry about with subcommunications„ÄÇ First is voice„ÄÇ

 and this really has three parts to it„ÄÇ Numb oneÔºå a downward tonality„ÄÇ

 Was that mean it's exactly how I'm talking to you right now„ÄÇ It's how your boss talks you„ÄÇ

 As opposed to an upwardity„ÄÇWhich is how people talk to someone they consider an authority„ÄÇ

 How are you„ÄÇ What would you like to orderÔºå You want that downward tonality because it projects certainty„ÄÇ

 SecondÔºå lower part of the range of your voice„ÄÇ This is the way the guys that are confident„ÄÇ

 Natural talk„ÄÇ Everyone has a range„ÄÇ So I'm not saying like artificially make your voice as little as possible„ÄÇ

 but just talk in the naturalÔºå lower part of your range of voice„ÄÇ Third partÔºå vocal projection„ÄÇ

 I see all sorts of guys„ÄÇ This is their biggestÔºå biggest problem„ÄÇ The girl can't hear them„ÄÇ A simple„ÄÇ

 simple way to fix this„ÄÇ B out while you are talking„ÄÇ

 There's a lot of ways that you can look up to project your voice„ÄÇ

 but this is the one thing that I've seen that is help people the most„ÄÇ just breathe out„ÄÇ

 breathe your stomach in and breathe out while you are talking„ÄÇ It'll fix this problem immediately„ÄÇ

 Second subcommunication„ÄÇ eye contact„ÄÇ This is very important„ÄÇ

 And it's something that I think a lot of guys get confused about„ÄÇ

 So a lot of guys that will read about DerekÔºå and they'll read that he has really intense eye contact„ÄÇ

And so then they'll go up to these girlsÔºå and their eyes will be wide and they look just anxiety stricken„ÄÇ

 but they're gonna just look her in the eyes by any means possible„ÄÇ

 And it comes off as unbelievably creepy„ÄÇ The way Derek actually looks people in the eye„ÄÇ

 And the reason it's so powerful is because it is just relaxed and steady„ÄÇ So how does this look„ÄÇ

 WellÔºå it's the same way as if you are staring at a wall„ÄÇ There's no anxietyÔºå There's no wide eyes„ÄÇ

 is just relaxed and steady„ÄÇ Third partÔºå congruent„ÄÇ

 A lot of guys worry about all these little things with subcommunications„ÄÇ are my pupils dilated„ÄÇ

 do I have the right posture„ÄÇ how far apart are my feetÔºå It is a bunch of goddamn nonsense„ÄÇ

 The only other thing that you have to worry about„ÄÇ

 and this will fix everything else is being congruent„ÄÇ This is a big part of subcommunications„ÄÇ

 being congruent just means speaking from the emotional state that you're in„ÄÇ

 So if you're in a bad moodÔºå speak from the bad mood„ÄÇ If you're excited„ÄÇ

 speak from a place of excitement„ÄÇ A lot of body languageÔºå little things that guys worry about„ÄÇüòä„ÄÇ

The reason why it doesn't look good is because they are spending all this extra energy trying to speak from a state that they are not in„ÄÇ

 so they'll try and sound excited„ÄÇ They'll try and sound cool if they don't feel cool at that particular moment„ÄÇ

 Just pick whatever emotional state that you're currently in and speak from there and all the rest of your subcommunications will be solved„ÄÇ

 another technical thing„ÄÇ and this is smallÔºå but it's something I've seen pretty much every guy who's really„ÄÇ

 really good with girls do you want there to be a certain flowing and non-breaking frame to the way you speak„ÄÇ

 How's it sound WellÔºå essentially sounds like someone who's stoned„ÄÇ

 So you'll see a lot of guys who are new to this„ÄÇ and they'll talk to you kind of like I'm talking to you now„ÄÇ

 maybe a little bit less excitedÔºå but they'll talk to their friends like oh yeahÔºå manÔºå yeah„ÄÇ

 that was a good time„ÄÇ Yeah YeahÔºå it was fun„ÄÇ All rightÔºå I'm gonna go approach this girl„ÄÇ Hey girl„ÄÇ

 how's it going b b it was completely incongruent with how they normally sound„ÄÇ

 and they are essentially breaking their frame while they're speaking because they're trying to„ÄÇ

Get into a mode that they think the girl will like„ÄÇ You know how the flow of your voice should sound„ÄÇ

 It should sound exactly the same as when you're talking to your friends or anyone else for that matter„ÄÇ

 Don't try and put on this like your voice gets higher and youre all excited and you're speaking super fast„ÄÇ

 Just talk exactly the same that slow steady pace as when you're talking to your friends„ÄÇ

 You' sound like this„ÄÇYeahÔºå manÔºå yeahÔºå that was that was a cool situation„ÄÇ YeahÔºå that was fun„ÄÇ

 alrightÔºå just a second„ÄÇHeyÔºå whereo„ÄÇYeahÔºå we just got to this barÔºå fun times„ÄÇ

To make a Jew baby with youÔºå blahÔºå blahÔºå rightÔºüI've noticed as Deerrek„ÄÇ

 his voice sounds exactly the same in almost any context„ÄÇ He's not breaking any frame„ÄÇ

 and he's not breaking the flow that he would normally talk in for anyone  Two more technical things„ÄÇ

 One breaking threads„ÄÇ I see a lot of new guys that will go up and they will start talking about something initially„ÄÇ

 which is great„ÄÇ But then they will stay on that thread forever„ÄÇ So they'll be likeÔºå yeah„ÄÇ

 I used to work at a flower shop„ÄÇ I really like daffodilsÔºå blahÔºå blahÔºå blah flowers„ÄÇ blahÔºå blah„ÄÇ

 blah flowers„ÄÇ That's not the way that you talk to someone when you're relaxed„ÄÇ

 and it's not the way you talk to someone when you're connected to them„ÄÇ

 When you're connected to someone„ÄÇ You naturally go over a variety of topics very quickly„ÄÇ

 and one thing just sort of jumps from another„ÄÇ So this is called breaking threads„ÄÇ

 Start talking about one thing and start talking about another„ÄÇ

 Don't get caught on any one thread when you're opening„ÄÇI see a lot of guys„ÄÇ

 They will learn certain moves„ÄÇ They will learn openers„ÄÇ And these openers would be fine„ÄÇ

 And maybe they even are honest to who they are„ÄÇ But they will do this weird little thing that doesn't make it work„ÄÇ

 They will go up to the girlÔºå They'll say the opener and then they will look at her for the reaction„ÄÇ

 like they're trying to figure out in real time„ÄÇ OhÔºå did it work and comes up as quite odd„ÄÇ

 So if I go up to you and I sayÔºå yeahÔºå we would make beautiful Jew babies„ÄÇWhat„ÄÇ

 what do you think of my line„ÄÇ What do you thinkÔºå What do you think„ÄÇ

 I'm staring at you waiting for your reactionÔºå That's not the normal way that you would talk to someone you are confident around„ÄÇ

 And that's not the way that you should talk to girls„ÄÇ

 If you're gonna say something immediately roll it under with something else„ÄÇ

 Just keep that flow going„ÄÇ Keep the flow„ÄÇ The saying that you would talk to someone else„ÄÇ

 But keep it a steady stream of your own thoughts„ÄÇ Don't be looking for how it affected the interaction„ÄÇ

 NowÔºå just a few common mistakes that I tend to see weekend after weekend with opening„ÄÇ Numb one„ÄÇ

 not be lining to the girl„ÄÇ RememberÔºå theyÔºå you know hover around the girl like some heat seeking Miss and then eventually approach„ÄÇ

 You want that direct line to the girl„ÄÇ Don't be the guy that does the walk around„ÄÇ Number two„ÄÇ

 not squaring up as in they will approach the girl from the side„ÄÇ

 and they'll just be like talking into her ear or even worseÔºå talking to her from behind„ÄÇ Really„ÄÇ

 you want to just be talking to her„ÄÇ Should aligned with her shoulders„ÄÇ

 hips are aligned with her hips„ÄÇ So you're just talking right in front of her as opposed to„ÄÇ

The side numberumb3Ôºå waiting for her to say things constantly that just shows a lack of certainty„ÄÇ

 And you once againÔºå you're peeing off of her to tell you who you are„ÄÇ

 just keep that steady stream of your opinionsÔºå your stuff coming Eventually„ÄÇ

 she will start adding in her own stuff„ÄÇ Numb 3„ÄÇ And this is very important„ÄÇ

 polarizing just for the sake of polarizing„ÄÇ So there's this common progression„ÄÇ

 I see a lot of new guys go throughÔºå They will start off and their super timid„ÄÇ

 Then they will learn about RSDÔºå and they will maybe listen to a few of Dererick's recordings„ÄÇ

 and then they will start polarizingÔºå which is saying things that might be a little bit on PC„ÄÇ

 saying things that are more their true opinions„ÄÇ and they will see that it works„ÄÇ

 And then they get into their mind that they should just be saying extreme polarizing things all the time and they just become this ubiquitously polarizing caricature of a person„ÄÇ

 NowÔºå what is the similarity between a guy who just polars all the time„ÄÇAnd a guy who is super timid„ÄÇ

 The similarity is that they are both not being themselves„ÄÇ

 and they are both not comfortable with themselves„ÄÇ

 A guy who is just comfortable with themselves who is just expressing himself„ÄÇ

 He will just naturally say some things that are polarizing some things that are normal„ÄÇ

 some things that are in betweenÔºå he will oscillate between all sorts of parts of behavior„ÄÇ

 The guys who only polarize over and over and over„ÄÇ

 is essentially like listening to a piece of music with someone playing the same chord over and over„ÄÇ

 The chord might be goodÔºå and it might be great in the context of other chords„ÄÇ

 but if you're just playing that chord over and overÔºå it creates a crap piece of music„ÄÇ

 So don't be the guy who's super polarizingÔºå Don't be the guy who's too timid„ÄÇ

 just be the guy who's him and let those polarizing moments come naturally„ÄÇ Book recommendation„ÄÇ

 whereverver you go there you are by John Cabo's in Exerse„ÄÇ

 Write down 10 things that are your honest opinions that you would usually not share with a stranger„ÄÇ

Go out and open using those 10 things„ÄÇ
