# RSD德里克-游戏十诫：2 肖恩解读：游戏十诫2.10 肖恩 第十节_ev

Commanment 10， thou shalt always be building your value。So in this section。

 we're talking about the side of lifestyle where you build your value。 And in Commandment 7。

 I alluded to the fact that there is two sides of lifestyle， right。

 There is the having fun building adventure， bringing the girl on your adventure side And then there's the work side where you are building a better life for yourself or building a better life for you and her。

 Well， now we're going to talk about the first side of lifestyle。

 building a better life for you and building a better life for her and for anyone else that happens to be in your life。

 We're going be talking about improving， working hard doing the things that other people don't want to do really getting success and really fucking focusing on that work area of your life。

 So why is this important。 I assume I'm kind of preaching to the choir here。

 but there's a lot of people that believe success just isn't all that important。

 And while they may have their points I disagree in terms of success with women。

 I think that this is extremely important to keep building your value to。Keep working on your life。

 People get extremely lazy in relationships， They flounderunder。 And then when the relationship ends。

 they're pretty much fucked， they weren't building their lives at that time。

 And now they are no longer in a position to get the next girl that could have been even better or they sabotage their own relationship by not building that value because they weren't on their own purpose。

 The girl loses attraction for him。 or the guy spends too much energy on the relationship。

 and he becomes needy。 He suffocates the relationship。

So I think even more importantly than how this affects your relationships is how this will look in the long term。

Let's think about the life of the average American。

 And I think I can generalize this for Western culture in general。 So if you're from Europe。

 if you're from Australia， probably even if you're from China， this is still very relevant。

 but let's talk about the average person's life and how it goes。

 Most people will probably have a little bit of fun in their late teens and early 20s。

 Maybe even a lot of fun。 but they will always be making short term decisions。

 And when they hit their 30s， they just sort of give up。 whatever dream they have。

 There's been too many things that have stomed on that dream。

 there's been too many times when they sabotage their own dreams。

 And they just no longer have the energy to continue on that dream any more。

 They start making small concessions。 They may be marry a person that isn't right for them。

 They get a job that isn't right for them。 They take on habits that weaken their brain or weaken their body。

 And after a while， it just becomes too hard to continue on that path of growth and that path of purpose。

So the average life of a person on this world is kind of maybe having a few years where they think about something that they're passionate about。

 maybe having a few years of fun， and then really just giving up。

So think about elementary school when you would talk about， okay， what does Sarah want to do。

 What does Jimmy want to do， You write down what you want your life to look like in the future。

 Write down what kind of job that you want to have in the future。

 Did one person in that class say they wanted to， let's say。

 be an insurance claims adjuster that lives in his studio apartment alone fighting with his girlfriends。

 who doesn't even like really， but is just afraid to break up with。

 drinkingrink cheap beer and watching Netflix， Did one fucking kid in that class say that he wanted that to be his life。

😡，Well， probably not。 but the truth is， for any given elementary school class。

 their life is going to be some variation of that。 They're not going to live where they want to live。

 They're not going to be doing what they want to do。

 They're not going to be with a person that is good for them or with a person that they're even really into。

 They're probably just in that relationship out of scarcity。

 And they're essentially just living a life that they would be ashamed of the niney old version of them would be sickened would be absolutely sickened if they saw what was happening 20 years later。

 And I think there's kind of this mythology really of giving up。

 as if giving up and having this mediocre life will give you some sort of happiness over actually going after success。

 Think of a show like King of Queens where the guy's really， he's， you know， he's given up。

 he's not really going after anything in his life。 But he kind of lives this charming life。 you know。

 he， has everything he wants。 and he doesn't really have the ambitions and he's cool with that。

 and he's really engaged in his sort of， you know， he's engaged in his giving up。

 He's engaged in his mediocrity。This is also why you kind of get these cultural mythologies where people will say。

 oh， rich people can't be happy or someone who's successful can't be happy because they're just。

 they're trying too hard。 You know， they're working too hard or they just don't understand the quaint charm of a middle class lifestyle or of a simple lifestyle。

 But is that what giving up looks like， Is that what it really。

 really looks like when people give up in the real world。

 when they opt for mediocrity in the real world。 Is there any quaint charm to it。

 Is there any solace found in it， Not really， Let's look at what giving up and mediocrity actually looks like in the real world。

If people gave up and then just completely accepted it。

 just completely accepted it and engaged in it like those TV shows， that would actually be fine。

But instead， they sink into this weird gray zone， where they haven't totally accepted their lifestyle and that this is the way it's going to be for the rest of their life。

 But they don't actually do anything to change it either。

 They're still comparing themselves to others。 They still getting jealous。

 They're still getting defensive They're still being manipulated by various forces。

 They're still getting mad at people that are challenging them are getting mad at people that are questioning them。

 So they're living through all the downsides of a life of mediocrity。

 without the only advantage of giving up， which would have been kind of a zen acceptance of your fate。

 So this misery that they ascribe to， let's say， people that are going after success。

 or people that are rich or people that are very progress focused。

 They are actually living through that。 They are living through that same hell with all the little petty arguments and all the little jealousies and all the little disadvantages of mediocrity。

 They're living through those same petty human。Emotions， but without the success。

And this reactionary， defensive lifestyle that I'm describing is not a rare cautionary tale。

 It is the default。 If you look at social media， you will see how much energy people spend on bullshit with no real hope for a better future life。

 The weird part is when you do try to succeed or you try and live in alternate lifestyle or a lifestyle that just goes a little bit against the grain。

 You'll find people often try to talk you out of it。They'll say， well。

 you can't spend all that time working。 You're going to get too stressed out or， you know。

 you have to relax， man， You have to spend time on this， or you have to spend time on that。

 But those same people who say， oh， well， you have to spend time relaxing and you can't wear yourself too thin。

 What are they actually doing with their free time。They're usually spending it on TV。

 social media or some sort of internet that isn't even productive or relaxing。

 They are essentially taking that extra time that could have been spent building a better life for themselves。

 And they are throwing it away。 They are throwing it in the fucking trash can。

 They're just watching TV。 Theyre getting angry at various news articles and things on the Internet and they're just living in this gray zone where they're not even relaxed。

 They're not productive， but they're not even relaxed and all that extra time isn't even spent on meaningful activities。

 Things that they will even remember a week later。What you have to realize is that time is going to pass anyways。

And you're either going to spend that time on nonsense or you're going to spend it on productive things or meaningful experiences。

 And if you are the rare person， we just want to live that simple life and you just prefer to spend all of your time on meaningful experiences without really sharpening the saw and live that quality of life without a decrease in quality of life over time。

 Well， then maybe go for it。 But if you're doing what most people are doing。

 which is just wasting time on things that make you defensive on things that are petty on things that you're never going to remember。

 then stop doing those things and just spend those time on things that are productive。

 you get this weird effect when you take that time that you are spending on， let's say。

 TV and then you start reading or you start working on projects， It's hard at first。

 But six months later， you look back and you realize that you are just as relaxed。

 you're just as comfortable， you're just as happy as when you were spending six hours a day watching TV or when you were spending two hours a day。

Looking at news articles， you naturally adjust to spending that time doing productive things and the quote unquote relaxation wasn't even necessary。

 I've also seen this weird dynamic where the people that avoid work the most end up having to work harder later in life because think about this if you just choose the most average life that you can live the most average life and you just get an average job and you have a couple of kids well。

 you're going to end up working longer hours later because you're going to be paid less and you're gonna to have to work those hours to support your kids you're going end up having to pay for things like healthcare care costs because you didn't take care of your body or alimony payments because you didn't choose your relationship wisely you're not gonna to be able to retire as soon because you didn't plan financially and the hours that you do work aren't even going to be at a job that you like so they're gonna feel like hell whereas the guy that quote unquote just works all the time and you know his life must suck he's probably working。

Something that he really， really loves。 The guys that I have seen that front load that work。

 Let's say they're just working 80 hours a week from the age of 18 to the age of 30。 Well。

 a lot of times they build a life during that process。

 or they never have to work again if they don't want to or if they do work。

 it's on projects that they love things that they're passionate about。

 They took care of their finances so they could really retire whenever they wanted。

 They have a girl that they really， really love and they have a great relationship with。

 and they can choose to marry her or not marry her。 but they have that relationship。

 and so that's not a strain on them。 They're working on things like their health。

 so they won't have to spend that extra energy getting up the stairs when they're 300 in 50 years old。

 They're working on things like their lifestyle。 so they can go have those real meaningful experiences rather than say watching the big bang theory for the seventh times like the seventh time that you've seen those stupid nerds tell terrible。

 andfunny jokes。 The guy who front loads his work。 who says， okay。

 I'm just gonna have a period of my。where I work really。

 really hard will often get to a point where he doesn't have to work at all。

 The guy who tries to avoid work will be working on maintenance things for the rest of his life。

 He will be paying that cost of not thinking about things beforehand， not working beforehand。

 and he will be paying that cost forever。 Think about some friends that you might have that maybe they thought you were an idiot for trying to get a good job and they just got some menial job。

 and there's nothing wrong with menial jobs is if it's what you really want to do。

 But think about the guy that just did it because he didn't want to work hard。

 That is most likely the guy who was working the most hours now， wouldn't you say。

 I know with my friends， the ones that chose those jobs。

 the guys that thought they were tricking society and taking some sort of shortcut。

 Those are the guys that are working the hardest now。

 they're the guys that have to work the most hours and they get paid the least for it。

 The point isn't to work yourself to death。 but to take a period of your life where you are building the life that you want to live forever。

 and to build the skill sets the discipline。That will help you in every area of your life。You。

 I remember I had this friend who。Was obsessed with being a millionaire。 He was in law school。

 and he really， really wanted to start his own business。 And one day I took him aside and I was like。

 you know， why are you so into this idea of being a millionaire， Why do you want this so bad。

 Like do you really need the money， And he said， I actually don't care about the money at all。

 I don't give a shit about the money。 The reason that I want to be a millionaire。

 is because I know itll be so hard for me to get to that point that I will have to build every skill in my life。

 I will have to build discipline， cognitive ability， problem solving ability。

 I will have to build all of that to such a degree that any other problem that comes up in my life。

 Well just be immediately easily handled， And I really thought about that。

 And it made a lot of sense。 And it was the same type of thinking that I was engaging in with this part of my life。

 I knew if I could get good at this。 If this was something that I could really get handled。

 It would bleed into every other area of my life。 And not only would that discipline All me to succeed financially or in my career。

 But that discipline oddly。ough would allow me to do the things that would make me happy as well。

 I think this is something people don't realize。 But being happy actually takes discipline。

 You have to build those habits that maybe have short term negativities。

 but make you happy in the long term。 You have to have that problem solving ability to figure out。

 okay， How does the brain work。 What is actually gonna make me happy。

 How does that work into my existing life。 All of the skills that you build， becoming， let's say。

 a millionaire becoming really， really good at a skill， going to grad school。

 All of those skills and all of that discipline actually applies directly to being happy as well。

 because happiness is a skill， which I will talk about in just a second。

 The people I know that never built any habits or never build any discipline。

 They're the least happy， because they don't exercise。 They don't meditate。

 They don't read books on happiness。 They have no ability to read books on happiness because they just don't read in general。

 It's one of those weird parts of life。 But happiness actually take。

takesA lot of discipline and it takes a lot of thought and it takes a lot of skill。

And the same skills that make you successful are going to make you good at that， Too。

 So let's talk a bit about how do we actually build that value。

 And I'm going to talk about how to build value and run your life in the long term。

 I'm going to talk a little bit about how to build value and run your life in the short term。

 And remember that we are specifically talking about doing productive things and getting really。

 really good in all areas of our life。 So first， how to run your life in the long term。 Well。

 you have to realize that there's really only one or two things that you are ever going to get really。

 really good at。 There's actually a book about this by Gary Keeler called the one thing where he suggests that you just get good at one thing and focus almost exclusively at that。

 One thing Derek taught me that has been profoundly influential in my life is that you never get to be the best at everything。

 If you want to be the best at something you have to pick one thing or maybe at the most two things。

 Think about Michael Phelps。 Michael Phelps doesn't get to be the best swimmer and。

The best poker player。 it would just take too much time and energy。 He had to pick one， right。

 If you want to get extraordinary at something， you have to really only pick one thing。

 If you want to get really， really good at something， you get to pick maybe two things。

 So maybe you don't want to be an Olympic level at one skill。

 But I would highly suggest you pick only two or at most three things maybe three things that you want to be really。

 really good at。 I've actually found that the people who get really。

 really good at something often have the best general knowledge of how the world works。

 because if you get extremely good at a skill， you have to learn a little bit about everything and how it affects that skill。

 You have to learn about economics， human psychology， problem solving， mathematics。

 really any number of related skills， and you have to understand how the world works in general on a very deep level if you're gonna get good at one or two or three things to an extreme degree。

Really good example of this。 One of my favorite books is called the Art of Learning。

 The guy that wrote this was the child in the movie searching for Bobby Fisher。 He was an amazing。

 amazing chess prodigy and became one of the best chess players in the world at a very young age and a new chess very。

 very thoroughly。 Oh， later， he also became one of the best pushhand fighters。 And in his book。

 you get a keen sense that he understands how the world works and all those nitty gritty details of how the world works。

 on a level that no one that tries to be good at everything will ever understand。

 He gain that general knowledge by getting extremely good at one skill and then very good at another skill。

 So I suggest you pick two maybe three things that you want to be excellent at in your life。

 And those things will bleed in naturally to the other parts of your life。

 They will help you understand the other parts of your life。

 Next is the things that you just kind of have to be somewhat good at。

 if you want to live a happy life and。😊，The common phrase for this is health。

 wealth and relationships。 The three things that people have the most problems with and that affect people's lives the most。

 So these things you want to be very good at。 You don't want to be the best in the world。

 You don't want to be someone who's measuring out all of their food。

 say and getting the exact right ratio of nutrients。

 But you do want to be someone who knows that field pretty well。

 and you want to be someone who's doing exceptionally well in that field。

 You want to be someone who's doing exceptionally well in the wealth field。

 You want to be someone who's doing exceptionally well in the relationship field。

 which is exactly why you're listening to this program。

 These are the things that you want to be very， very good at。

 but you don't want to spend your life's work thinking about。

 So you have that one to two to maybe three things that you are very， very excellent at。

 Then you have things that you are very good at， which should be health wealth relationships。

 And you know， if you want to choose one other thing that's fine to。 It's important to you。

 And then the rest really just takes care of itself。So this kind of simplifies your life， doesn't it。

 gives you at most six things that you have to worry about。 And realistically。

 probably four or five things。 You probably already know what that one thing is going to be for you。

 And hopefully you're probably already on that path towards mastery。

 So we have those four things in our life。 Only four things we have to worry about。

 maybe five things。 So how do you actually get better at that thing。 Well。

 we talked a lot about getting good at one part at a time。 small chunking it。

 This is really the only way that your brain works。 If you want to build a habit。

 you have to focus on that habit exclusively， if you want to get really good on。

 let's say a part of that skill。 Maybe you're in finance， and you want to get really。

 really good on economic psychological theory。 You have to really focus on that thing to the exclusion of other things。

 So you start by picking a small part of that big thing that you want to be an expert on。

 And you go very， very deep on that small part。 There's a great book called Deep。By Cal Newport。

 where he talks about focusing on one thing at a time and how that has much。

 much better effects than let's say trying to focus on 10 things at a time。

 So you chose that one thing。 And now you're trying to choose that small part of that one thing。

 Well， how do you choose， I think of this as the first thing or the worst thing。

 So if you're just starting off on that skill， Pick the first thing。 So in this case。

 let's say it would be opening。 or you want to pick the worst thing。

 The thing that you are worse at in that particular field， the thing that needs the most improvement。

 Another way to think of this if you don't want to think of it in negatives is what part if worked on would provide the most gains in that skill。

 Maybe there's one part that you've just been neglecting， And if you worked on it。

 it would improve whatever skill that you're working on 50%。

 doesn't even necessarily have to be something you're bad at。

 But just it would provide the best opportunity for next learning。 So first thing or the worst thing。

 then you have to start gathering information on how you get better at that thing？

 And there's three ways。You do this， and they're the same three ways that I've seen everyone who is an expert gain knowledge on those particular skills。

 One is reading Why is reading so important。 I think people vastly underestimate how important reading is。

 Well， someone who has worked their entire life getting good at a skill or learning a field will then spend a couple years distilling that knowledge into a medium that you can buy for $30。

 and they're often not doing this for money。 They're doing this so that they can relay that information so that they can leave a legacy and show people the amazing realizations that they've had in that field。

 You can get millions and millions of dollars based on $20 books or a $15 audible subscription。

 You can get millions of dollars worth of value。 learn things that you never would have learned otherwise。

 These aren't things that you're just gonna learn if you work on something hard enough。

 They are things that you will never learn otherwise or ways that are framed in a way that you will never hear otherwise。

Second， direct exposure。 Remember， we talked in the first commandment about doing the reps。

 Do the reps。 and action is the most important part of a skill。 When you take action。

 things start to fit together。 Things that you heard about in theory or maybe thought you understood in theory。

 Now， you have real memories of how those work and all the little nuances and something that works one way for somebody might work a different way for you。

 So now you can see the nuance in those things。 So exposure is extremely important。 Remember。

 action is really the only way you ever get better out of skill。Third。

 and I think this is most important。 direct teaching and direct mentorship。

 I've seen a lot of people say， oh， well， you know， I don't want a direct teacher。

 I just want to read all this material and maybe watch YouTube videos or something。

 and I'll just get the information from there。 It's free， right？ You it's all free。

 I'll just get that information。 You will never know how that information applies directly to you。

 You will never get direct feedback。 You will never hear the most relevant parts of their experience that will get you results right now with your specific sticking point。

 When I think back to the skills I've gotten really， really good at in all of them。

 I had strong mentors and someone directly teaching me because they will always be able to tell you what the next step is specifically for you。

 and what the feedback is specifically for you。 You can cut 10 years off your learning curve just by finding a good teacher。

So you are getting all of this information and you're going really。

 really deep on a topic and you're going out or doing whatever skill that you're focusing on。

 So you're seeing how the stuff is working in the real world。 During this time。

 you are starting specific habit。 and it is essential that you only start one at a time。 Now。

 they say a habit takes anywhere from 21 days to 30 days to implement。

 I think that you should only start one habit at a time。 However。

 this doesn't mean that you can't be focused on several habits at a time。

 And I'll explain what I mean。 So let's say that you start a habit today， and you are really。

 really focusing on getting that habit nailed in for 10 days。

 And then you start another habit 10 days from now。 Well。

 now the hardest period of starting that first habit is over， you're still focusing on it。

 but you're able to now focus some of your attention on that next habit while also paying attention to the first habit。

 And keep in mind， these are small habits within the small chunk of the bigger thing that you are working on。

 So these are very， very specific things。 So let's say you're getting。This and you're going really。

 really deep on conveying your identity。 On day 1， you might want to start tracking。

 am I making good eye contact with people。 And then on day 10， you are still tracking。

 am I making good eye contact with people。 You're tracking that for 30 days。

 But then you start focusing on your voice， voice projection。 And then on day 20。

 you're still focusing on those last two things， But then you start focusing on the new habit of honesty。

So you are able to focus on each of those small habits within the small part that youre going very。

 very deep on。 However， you are sort of overlaying those hard10 day periods where you're focusing most of your energy on one。

 So you have that big thing that you're working on that thing that you want to be an expert on。

 Then you pick the first thing or the worst thing that would be best for you to focus on within that big thing。

 Then you start reading， you start having that direct experience。

 you start finding mentors and learning from those mentors。 And while you are learning。

 you are going deep on those small habits， those little things that you really want ingra and then you are overlaying those with each other。

 Well， you might do this for two or three months， and then you're done with that little small part of the big thing that you want to be an expert on。

 and then you move to the next thing。 The thing is people naturally can go deep on something for。

 let's say， 30，60，90 days where they're just focus on that， they will find that they get really。

 really good at that small part， they get really good at the habits within that small part。

And then they can move on to the next small thing。 So once you're done with that really small thing of the big thing that you want to be an expert on。

 start the pattern over， start on that next small thing and go really， really deep on that。 Next。

 I'm going to talk a bit about how to run your life in the short term。

 So one of my biggest realizations in the past couple years。 This is a simple but a huge realization。

 It really changed my life。Your long term quality of life and your long term progress is directly tied to how organized you are。

 And by organized， I do not mean how organized your shelf is。

 I mean how organized and algorithmized your life is。

 So we are actually talking with one of our buddies， Sam。

 who you will hear an interview with later on this exact topic last night。

And he was showing me his weekly checklists， his daily checklists。

 some of his higher goals and just how organized every single part of his life is。

 He has it all well thought out and written down and actionable in checklist like steps。

 And this is one of the most productive people。 I know。

 And what I realize is I have actually built an almost identical system to him in the last couple of years。

 because it's just so powerful to keep your life organized in that way。

 And to be a very productive person， you almost have to。

 It's almost essential to have your life extremely organized。

 So what does this mean was this mean for you。 Well。

 it means that you should have your overarching goals written down and accessible so that you can look at them every day。

 Your short term goals written down and accessible。 a weekly checklist。

 the things that you want to get done this week。 And a daily checklist。

 And the more detailed this daily checklist is the better。

 One thing I noticed about Sam that makes him。😊，So fucking effective is that he will have specific times。

 I will do this at this time， and then I will do this， and then I will do this at this time。

 and then I will do this。 And he's actually able to start many habits at once。

 He's able to implement many habits at once， even though that's supposed to be impossible。

 because every day of his life is basically run like an algorithm。 So he just follows the algorithm。

 And if it has three new habits， he just runs through the algorithm and runs through those habits every single day。

 because all of his life is attuned to that checklist and attuned to that algorithm。

 He's able to implement information about three times faster than the average person。😡。

One thing that I add to this beyond those goals， short term goals。

 weekly checklist and daily checklist actually have notes for every single area of my life so that everything is written down。

 So I'll have a finance note。 I will have a spiritual note。 I will have a social note。

 where I write down the most important people in my life and。

 you know what needs to be done for that relationship， etc cetera。

 I have a note for every part of my life。 And then I have a habit of once a month updating all of those with what goals I have in that area。

 What's going on in that area。 What I learned in that area this month。 So then I have these notes。

 these overarching notes that take care of every single area of my life。

 so that everything is written down。 Now， do you have to do this exactly like Sam did or exactly like I did。

 Not necessarily， but here's the pattern that made this work for us。

 And here's the pattern that you should follow when you make your own organization system。 Numb one。

 everything is written out。 Everything in our lives is written out。

 And so we can see how one part fits in the whole。 We can see。

The medium parts fit with every other medium part。 Everything is written out。 Second。

 there is never a question as to what you should be doing。 So we always know， okay。

 I've looked at my finance note。 I need to be doing this with my finance note this month。

 and then I put that on my weekly checklist and I put that on my daily checklist or with。

 let's say my spiritual note meditation。 I know that okay。

 I need to be meditating in this exact way or listening to this guided meditation four times a week or seven times a week。

 and I put that in my weekly note， and then I put that in my daily checklist。 Third concept。

 There is a way to track progress。 though there's many different ways to do this。

 You can use a spreadsheet。 you can use an app。 but you should be tracking your progress so you can see okay。

 in the past year。 This is how each metric went up each metric went down and how often I adhere to my habits and how I was doing pretty much everything in my life。

 So once again， everything is written out， there's no question as to what you should be doing。

 and then there's a way to track progress。Now I'm going to just talk about a few common pitfalls I see people make when building value and living a successful life。

First， not developing their social skills。 People don't realize this or the people that do realize this。

 I don't think they realize what degree this is true to。

 But social skills are the skill that will amplify your success。 Every I know that has gone very。

 very successful。 Yeah， maybe they were particularly good at their specialty。

 but they were also unbelievably good communicators。 They knew how people's emotions were。

 They knew how to joke around with people。 how to come off in the right way。

 They had a lot of social intelligence。 They knew social skills inside and out。 In fact。

 I have seen a lot of people who had intuitive understanding of social skills just be successful。

 really just because of that。 They weren't even good at anything else。

 They were just successful because people just like them。

 And then someone offered them a really high paying job。 and that was that。 So I would say。

 focus on your specialty and focus on it a lot。 but realized that your successful be directly correlated with。

How good of a communicator you are My buddy Michael actually gets paid about twice as much as the other people on his job for doing the same work because he's just learned how to be friends。

 you know， the CO， the CEO， he's able to pal around with those guys。

 so he's actually just done quite well based solely off social skills。Number 2， the I'm done pitfall。

 A lot of guys will get really， really good at something。 Let's say they get in really。

 really good shape。 and then they look at the mirror。

 and they see how good of shape they've gone into。 and they just say， oh， I'm done。

 I'll always be like this。 It'll always be like this。

 People have a tendency to forget how much work when into the success that they have。

 And so they stop doing upkeep。 That same guy， he doesn't realize， okay， I do have this reward now。

 however， this isn't just an inherent part of my life。

 I have to keep working out if I want to keep this reward。 We get used to reward。

 So we think that they're just inherent parts of who we are now。 Number 3。

 not putting any enjoyment until those long term skills。 You know。

 we talked about maybe getting really， really good at one thing and then getting pretty good at health wealth and relationships。

 If you don't have any fun doing those things。 You're eventually going to drop out。

 It's almost impossible not to。 if you're not having fun doing them。 In fact， one of the guys I。😊。

that got the best at this ended up dropping out。 And he really just kind of gave up on women because it was just too stressful for him。

 He was having no fun doing this stuff and just became this like very stressful。

 very serious endeavor。 And even though he was extremely， extremely good at it。

 He just had to drop out。 He had too many negative anchors where he just wasn't having any fun。

 And it was all about his ego。 Numb4， not being open to long term feedback。 we all have blind spots。

 And I talked a bit about that before。 I asked my friends to actively point out my blind spots。

 There's this interesting progression that I've seen guys go through in this particular field。

At first， they will be anxious。 Let's say when talking to girls， they'll be anxious。

Then they'll get kinda good， and they'll just be apathetic。

 So they're no longer getting approach anxiety because they're anxious。

 Now they're just kind of lazy。 Then they'll get really， really good。

 and they'll stop approaching out of arrogance。 So they'll say stuff like， oh。

 I'm too good for that one。 Or she looks like an idiot or something like that， really。

 what's happening is they're still feeling anxious， But now they are rationalizing it as， well。

 I'm an expert。 And I'm too good for these people anyways。

 You have to make sure that no matter what stage you get to in this or in any other area。

 You still have a growth mentality， You are still asking for feedback。

 You are constantly thinking about what can I do better， Now there is a caveat to this。

 The feedback has to be long term has to be specific and it has to be actionable。

 So this is how we stop ourselves from ruminating on， did I do this right， did I do that， right。

 It's like， oh you know， what does this feedback mean， What does this little feedback mean。

 We focus on feedback in the long term So that we're not。Constantly paying off people。 however。

 we still stay in that growth mindset and that feedback mindset。5 ego。 This one is huge。

 And I'm going to give you a really， really heavy example on this。 So one of my best friends。

 dads got appendicitis earlier this year。 and his dad was a bit of a tough guy。 You know。

 is the sort of guy that would always do things for himself， Never ask anyone one for help， kind of。

 you know， a bit of a big ego。 and he got appendicitis。 and instead of going to a hospital。

 he just kept drinking various types of maillos taking aspirin taking all sorts of pills and different medicines to try and make it go away。

 He felt like he could handle it。 So his appendix burst。 and he still didn't call the hospital。

 In fact， he didn't tell anyone。 and he ended up dying。 Now。

 I had a long conversation with my friend。 and we were talking about how basically his dad's ego had killed him。

 and how he could have had 30 more years with his dad If his dad had just been able to let go of a little bit of that ego。

 His father had chosen the fantasy of who he imagined himself to be this person who would never。😔。

Hell from anything over the reality of him possibly dying。 Now， let me ask you something。

 How many men do you think die a year from causes that are directly related to their ego。

 They make a wrong decision。 They don't seek medical care。

 They piss someone off or start a fight with someone that they know could injure them。

 I would say probably a surprising percentage of men die due to actions related to their ego。

 Probably something like 5 or 10 per of all men throughout the history of the world have died to issues relating to this。

 You have to realize that there is a fantasy of who you are and how things will work。

 And then there is the reality。 The reality is you might get rejected thousands of times in your process of finding the right girl。

 The fantasy is that it's all going to be easy or the fantasy when you're good is that you can't learn anything further。

 There is always a fantasy is always bullshit。There is always a reality that has to be dealt with。

 And the thing getting in the way between the two of those is your ego。Number 6， cognitive biases。

 Why do smart people make mistakes。 One thing that I have noticed is some of the most raw intelligent people I've ever met in my life often make the most mistakes in practical problem solving。

 Now， why is this。Is because those type of people never had the pressure to be aware of their own psychological tendencies and to be aware of their own cognitive biases。

 so you might get someone who's extremely smart， but they don't know about the halo effect and if they do know about it。

 they think it just doesn't apply to them because you know my brain's powerful and I would never succumb to that。

 you'll get all sorts of people that are extremely intelligent were extremely easily manipulated because they just lack the self-awareness that the things that work on other people or the traps that other people fall into also work on them and they will also fall into those traps Now。

 going over all the cognitive biases is way too comprehensive for this section。

 but I would refer you to a video called the 25 most common cognitive biases by Charlie Mungger and the book Thinking Fasts and Slow by Daniel Kaneman Lastly。

 the last subject that I want to cover is longterm happiness So most people will spend their life chasinging shortterm pleasures or even chasing longterm pleasures。

 but oftentime。They don't get any happier。 Theres actually an effect that let's say if you were to win the lottery and you actually did well with that money。

 you kept the money and got a higher quality of life。 Well， a year later， statistically。

 you would feel exactly the same amount of happiness as you did before you won the lottery。

 This is called the hedononic treadmill。 It means that when you step up on the quality of life scale。

 Eventually you feel the same amount of happiness。 And when you step down on the quality of life scale。

 Let's say you got your lay cut off or something。 A year later。

 you're still going to feel the same amount of happiness。

 This is just one of those psychological tendencies that humans have。

 So how do we actually get off the hedononic treadmill。 Well。

 I want you to make an underlying change in how you understand happiness。

 Hiness is a skill and happiness is a muscle。 It is somewhere in between those two things。

 It something that you learn about and get good about like chess。

 and it is something that you build up like a muscle and something that has to be maintained like a muscle。

 It is not something that you were given is not。😊，Something that is related to the situation of your life。

 although that can help， but it is rather something that you get better at over time and is something that has specific tasks built into it。

 much like any other skill or any other building of a muscle。

 So how do we develop that long-term happiness。 I'm going to keep this relatively short so that you can keep it actionable。

 But I want to break this into four parts。 N one is developing your longterm presence。

 N two is decreasing defensiveness。 Number three is processing wounds and number four is positive lifestyle。

 So let's start with developing long-term presence。 It's been said before。

 but the only access you really have to your life is through the present moment。

 Pa doesn't actually exist。 the future doesn't actually exist。

 And while you have to plan for it and learn from the past。

 the only actual access you have to your life is right now， In practical terms。

 what is staying present cause happiness。 because a lot of our anxiety and a lot of our strife from day to day comes from unnecessary。

About the future， unnecessary thoughts about the past。

 unnecessary emotions or engaging in unnecessary emotions or over analyzingly what is happening right now。

 when you are able to get to a point where you don't have those automatic thoughts。

 Those automatic emotions are lessons and you are not having those constant negative emotional spikes from。

 oh， this thing happened in the past。 This thing might happen in the future。

 This is what this thing means right now。 Someone looked at me bad。 That's what this means。

 when you're not constantly having those small emotional spikes。

 What you'll find is that there's just a happiness that comes out of you， it's your natural state。

 And that's why you'll sometimes hear people say happiness is your natural state。

 you get rid of those little automatic bullshit thoughts。

 and you are just focus on what's happening right now。

 you will find that your natural state is to just be happy。 Now， how do we get there。 really。

 there's two parts。 Zen Buddhism is very concerned with this exact problem and to try and summarize it would be very hard。

 But one of the main concepts is what's called。Resistance。

 So how do we shut off those negative thoughts or those negative emotions。 The truth is。

 it's impossible。 You can't do it。 If you are thinking a thought or you are thinking an emotion。

 you might be able to cut it off a little bit。 But really。

 it's almost impossible to cut off one of those things with any degree of reliability。

 So what Zen teaches is what's called nonresistance。 That means that if you have a thought。

 let's say some little thought about the past pops up。 You just sort of go， okay， yep。

 my brain's doing that thing again。 It's popping up with that thought again。 That's fine。

 and you don't resist it。 when you have those negative emotions。 Let's say you're feeling anxious。

 So I' trying to fight that anxiety， which will never work。 You say， okay， yep。

 I'm feeling that emotion， I can feel that emotion in my body。 and that just is what it is。

 when you have that nonresistance to those negative thoughts and those negative emotions。

 You will find that they are less temporary。 They just go away on their own。 However。

 when you resist something， it persists。 when you resist the anxiety and you start thinking about it。

You might spend 30 minutes thinking about the anxiety and why was this cause and what this mean about my life。

 And you will actually be prolonging a feeling that would have just gone away on its own。

 So just accept reality。 sayy， I'm thinking this or am feeling this。

 And what you will find is if you get into this habit， that longterm presence just happens naturally。

 The second way to build this long-term presence as you can probably guess is meditation。

 And that's probably something that we could talk about for hours and hours。

 But the gist of it is just find a type of mindfulness meditation that you like。 Down an app。

 Start listening to guided meditations and just do it consistently。 You can do it five minutes a day。

 And that's all you can do great。 If you can do it an hour a day， Even better。

 But the most important thing is that you do it consistently。

 There's a reason that this gets hammered so many times in the self-help industry。

 because it fucking works for some people that don't do it and that's fine。

 But if you are the type of person that is interested in maximizing their happiness and。

Maximizing that longterm presence， Probably a habit that you should pick up。 Second。

 decreasing defensiveness。 Understand the difference between defensiveness and negativity。

 So negativity is sometimes essential。 cynicism is sometimes essential because we want to be looking at reality in an objective way or in a way that's as objective as possible。

 So I'm not saying never be negative。 Never say anything that you know other people might find negative because that's just ridiculous。

 There's some things that just are negative。 World War I was in a positive time。

 but we should probably still learn about it。 The difference is that defensiveness is a constant negative reaction to everything that's going around you。

 I talked about this a little bit earlier。 Our brain has two modes。

 There's a defensive mode and in exploratory mode。 And most people spend the vast majority of their time in that defensive mode。

 So they will be thinking， oh， what is this person think about me。 Oh， you know。

 what about that argument I had earlier。 What about this person。

 They have a different opinion than me。uckThat person。 What about this thing that happened to me。

 What about this thing that could happen to me， You know， what if my life ends up like this。

 Most people are unaware of this， But they are actually spending their entire life so concerned with little things that happened or little things that could happen or other people that didn't agree with them。

 They are spending so much time in this defensive mode that they are wasting their whole fucking life And the first step is just becoming aware of it。

 Be aware of how often you are arguing with someone in your head that you don't even have an argument with。

 become aware of how often you are thinking about， oh。

 what does this person's comment mean about me of thinking about some past situation that is over of thinking about some future situation that's never going to happen that you're just wasting mental energy on once you become aware of these things you can start to naturally gravitate away from them and gravitate more towards that exploratory mode。

 What do I find funny What opportunities are there here。 What things am I interested in。

 What things do I find beautiful。😡，What conversations do I want to have。

 What kind of books do I want to read， Find the sort of things in life that you actually enjoy and start gravitating towards those and spending your mental energy thinking about those。

 The way society is built right now。 We are literally。

 and I do mean literally being programmed to being in that defensive mode all of the time。

 something like Facebook， something like Reddit， something like clickbait news sites。

 They are designing titles。 They are designing images that trigger those defensive things in your mind and make you wonder。

 oh， am I good enough。 Oh， what's happening in the world。 Oh， I can't believe this person said that。

 They are designing these things in such a way that you feel compelled like you have to click right now。

 And this is programme your brain to be in that defensive mode all of the time。

 And people have spent billions of dollars figuring out what is going to get people into that defensive mode。

 was going to make them not feel like they're good enough。

 was is going to make them feel like the world is falling apart。😊。

What can we do so that they feel like they have to read this article。 And I pick on clickbait media。

 but all sorts of other industries are doing this as well。

 You are being programmed to be in this defensive mode。 One last comment on defensiveness。

 There's an old Gandhi quote that says something along the lines of I realized I was not being punished for my anger but by it。

 realize that when you start trying to hurt other people or punish them by， let's say。

 like being angry at them， by yelling at them by trying to get revenge on them。

 All you're really doing is engaging in that emotion。 And in order to get into that mode。

 you have to feel that emotion as well。 So while you may think that you are punishing people by。

 let's say thinking about them in an angry way or spending your mental energy on why they're a terrible person and why they suck and what's all the logical reasons for that。

 while you may think that you are eventually going to be hurting that person by engaging in those thought processes。

 all you're really fucking doing is bringing yourself into those emotions。

 So instead of letting those。😡，Things take up your mental space and forcing you to engage in those emotions。

 Why not just fucking focus on something else。3， processing wounds。 Look， I'm not a therapist。

 I'm sure that there are way better resources on how to process wounds。

 I just want to give my little thought because I know that there's a lot of people that have things in their life that happens that they don't know how to get over。

 If you do have something that you feel is really affecting you。

 I would suggest going to see a therapist。 And if one of those things is affecting your life to such a degree that you feel like you are going to take action on it。

 I would suggest going and seeking help immediately。 So how do we process wounds。 Well。

 pattern that I've seen is that a lot of people will get into therapy。

 or they will have some realization about their past wounds。

 And it will help them understand that past wounds。 but it' will not actually help them get over it。

 I mean， we all know the person that's， let's say， been in therapy for 20 years。

 And they understand their problems probably better than anyone one on earth。

 but they still have that problem。 They still have that。Thought pattern。

 They still have that behavioral pattern that is ruining their life。

 So a frame shift that I want you guys to take。 who are struggling with that is to focus less on why and focus more on what。

 And this is not something I pulled out of my ass there are actually a lot of studies on why this works。

 What does this mean， This means instead of focusing on Okay， Why do I feel this way。

 Why am I taking this action， Why did this happen to me。 Why is the world like this。

 A much more productive ways to focus on what， So what is triggering this thought。

 What is triggering this behavioral pattern。 What makes this behavioral pattern worse。

 What makes this behavioral pattern better。 What do I want instead of this pattern。

 What actions can I take to get that new pattern， So this is one of those small distinctions。

 but that actually has a lot of research on it， when you are focusing instead on the actions that you can take。

 and the real world practicalities of what are going to stop this thought pattern and what are going to stop this behavioral pattern。

 You actually get over these wounds much quicker because you are。Breaking the pattern。

 On the other hand， it's been shown that people that focus too much on why， why something happened。

 why they feel this way， often come up with conclusions that are false and conclusions that do not help them process the wounds in any real way。

 Numb 4， positive lifestyle。 Mainframe to take away from this， input equals output。

 when you're thinking about health relationships， anything else。 input equals output。

 If you are eating like shit， you are going to naturally feel like shit。

 And this is something that actually surpasses the hedonic treadmill。

 You will just feel more like shit in general， even if you've been eating like shit forever。

 This means green leafy vegetables， studying nutrition。

 doing everything you can to get your health on point。 This means building quality relationships。

 Sur yourself with people that you want to be like。 Remember。

 you are the five people that you hang out with most。 This means reading quality material。

 always be reading something， finding new quality content， something to make your life better。

 This means having quality。This means getting your spiritual stuff handled。 you know。

 that meditation stuff that we just talked about input always equals output and positive lifestyle does have a real effect on building that happiness muscle and building that happiness skill。

 The last thing I want to discuss in terms of happiness。

 You've learned a lot of material in this program。 And hopefully you've learned a bit how to be more confident and how to be a happiness person in general。

 But one of the main sticking points that I see with guys that learn confidence or that dive into self helpp is that they will always be looking for the next thing to make them complete and they might have started off on that path where they're like。

 okay， maybe I can just fix a few things。 But then it becomes a lifestyle where they never feel complete。

 They never let themselves feel happy。 becomes a lifestyle of maybe I'll feel complete later。

 Maybe I'll let myself feel happy later。 One thing that I learned from Derek is that he is able to feel confident and get feedback at the same time。

 He is able to go into that。😊，fid fully to not question himself。

 but then to get long term feedback so that any mistakes he's making are dealt with。

 I had that realization for myself after meeting him， that if I didn't put that happiness first。

 And if I didn't put that confidence first， that feeling of I'm just going to be happy。

 no matter what problems come up， I'm going to deal with the problems when to deal with the fucking problems。

 but I'm going to be happy either way。 I'm going to feel confident even if there is more steps for me to take。

 even if there is feedback for me to take。 I had that realization that if I didn't do that now。

 it would never happen。 And that's one of the main ways in which Deerrick has changed my life。

 remember to take long term feedback， and remember that you only really have to be working on one thing at a time。

 And that allows you to not be constantly pinging off people to have that confidence and to have that happiness。

 society is designed to have you feel small amounts of happiness and small amounts of confidence so that you aren't miserable but so that you are also easily controlled。

What we've given you here is a system that allows you to feel real certainty and confidence。

 remain immune to undo control by outside influences while still being open to long term improvement。

 So trust the process。 trust yourself and make now the time that you are going to let yourself start feeling that confidence and happiness that you've put off for later days。
