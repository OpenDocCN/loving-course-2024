# RSD《诱惑开悟》：《诱惑开悟》第一节 自然之道_ev

There's a subset of men who move among women with ease。These rare men are those who have acquired。

 who have consciously learned。The ability to see women in their natural state。

Who can see right through their makeup up their walls。Their insecurities and their loss。

They see women as they really are。Women can sense immediately。

When they are in the presence of a man who likes women。Who thinks they are beautiful？

Who makes them feel lovely？Who delights in them？He genuinely likes women。

And men that like women are liked by women。So。Women opened themselves up to him willingly。

This is because he understands the things。That women universally respond to。

 He is not like other men。And women know it。So who are these men？Allowed to ro unhindered。

In the land of women。And what qualities do they possess？

That compel women to allow them liberty is not afforded to other men。

These are the men we call naturals。Natural seducers。A natural facility with women。

A man who is comfortable in the land of women。Now there have been times at speaking engagements。

Where I've been introduced as an example of a true natural， Zan， my friend Zan is a natural。

And as I'm walking up to the stage， I'm scratching my head and I'm thinking。Is that really true。

 am I really a natural， is that really what I am？Am I a true natural？Well。

 let's run down the usual checklist， shall we and find out？Do I believe in women， yes I do。

Am I comfortable around women？🎼H am。Do I flirt with women， of course？All ages， shapes and sizes。

🎼Have I。Have I dated beautiful women， yes， I have"。

Have I had great relationships with wonderful women。The best。What about this question？

Have I slept with a lot of women？Onehy the most， I suppose， have I had three sums？Or more sums。

 more than three。Hm。So am I anatural， does that make me a natural？Well how about this question？

Can I extract a phone number from a girl in a clever or party？yeah， I can。

Can I perhaps extract the entire girl from the club of the party？Forget the phone number。Yeah。

 I suppose I can， but there are other guys that are better at doing that than me。Like I always say。

 I am not a pickup artist。That's not what interests me。How about this question？

Can I take your woman away from you？M probably not， after all。

 you're most likely a good husband or boyfriend， she loves you， she wouldn't leave you for me。

But can I convince her to have a secret affair with me， well well， that's a different question。

I wouldn't， of course， that's not the way I do things， but yeah， I probably could。You see。

 I am a lover of beauty。Beauty in all its forms， art in all its forms， and that attitude。

Will make you automatically more magnetic to women。Tactics and techniques。

Will'll allow you to take a girl home from a club or a party。I'll teach you that。

 but what I'm talking about is so much deeper because given an hour。With a very same girl。

 your delight in her will create a kind of poetry for her， a connection。

So here is the part that really interests me。As opposed to picking up a girl。

What interests me is the notion of creating chemistry and amplifying attraction。You know。

 the first time you spend time with her or a coffee or a glass of wine。

So maybe I'm the best at convincing a girl to leave the club with me。

But give me an hour with that very same girl。And I can pretty much guarantee that she will remember me for the rest of her life。

So does that make me a natural？Let's see， do I believe that I can seduce any given woman in any room？

Yes， as a matter of fact， they do。Now， am I always successful？

Instroeduccing any given woman in the room， no。And that is a very。

 very important point for you to remember， you see my ability。

And I belief in my ability to seduce women。Is not necessarily related to my actual success in seducing women。

But I'll tell you this。That attitude will take you very far， it is endearing to women。

And there is no harm in it。Believe me， it will open far more doors for you than it closes。

 it's refreshing to women to hear that I simply decided one day long ago that every woman that talks to me or interacts with me at all is interested in me。

It's not always true， of course。But it is a very fun and empowering way to conduct your life。

So was I born a natural， was I born？Naturally good to women。No。And I'll tell you why。

It's because the first secret of naturals is this。They're not born with it。

Every man throughout history。Who is good of women？Was good because he chose to be at one point in his life。

Tired of rejection。He decided to consciously get that part of his life handled， he made a choice。

And so he began to interact with women， he began to listen to women。

He tried and failed and he retained the things that worked。And discarded the things that didn't。

 in other words。He invented himself。So there's nothing I say or do that you can't say or do。

It's all just a choice。Naturals are not born， they're made。

Now I've been interested in this for a very long time。

Why is it that some men and women really seem to have an aura， a presence？

A way of drawing others into their reality。Can it be broken down and described？Can it be taught？

Can it be learned？You know， if you have a friend who is a natural or had a friend in college。

 for instance， who was good of the women， and you happen to ask him about his prowess with women。

 he probably looked at you kind of blankly and said something like，I don't know， just be yourself。

Well， we know that doesn't work。You see the thing about men who are naturals， who are good of women。

Is that they have a very hard time describing exactly what it is they do or say。It just comes。Well。

 naturally。Now the first thing someone will shout out is that these guys are that way because they have a lot of self confidence。

 well， this is correct。But it isn't all。There's something more。Something more than self confidence。

And inner clarity。And understanding。Asentedness， a purpose。Well， I can only speak。

From my own experience and what has running true to me all these years。

And I have identified 10 traits。Common to all natural seducers，1 traits。

Every man in history who was good with women had all of these traits， all of them，1 traits。

There may be more， but these are the ones I have identified。And as I reflected on this。

 it dawned on me that。I don't think it is。Ever really been described before these traits。

But I really truly believe this is the essence of what we are trying to capture and bear in mind。

This is all very hard to describe。These are a set of very powerful and yet rarely understood concepts。

Very subtle。And there is some overlap。But let's take a look at these10 traits。

And see if we can't catch a glimpse into the mindset。Of a natural。Trade number one。

To a natural seducer。They are all his girls。Every woman is his woman。

He has immense compassion for women， he sees their sadness and their loss。They're faded dreams。

They're dead and dying relationships， they're stultifying careers and responsibilities。

 and he makes it his mission。To impart beauty to her life again。And he does this with every woman。

 including the 60 year old waitress who is serving him eggs for breakfast。They are all his girls。

 he makes that waitress shine。He makes her feel pretty。

He makes you feel alive and inspired once again。It's because he believes that women deserve passion。

And he knows they are not getting it from the men they are involved with。So it is his mission。

To correct this imbalance is the first trait。A natural seducer has compassion for women， all women。

Remember， they're all his girls。It is his mission in life to make them feel alive and pretty again。

 and he does it。To illustrate that。I'll tell you a story or time I was at a party。

And it was a really fancy party there a lot of people there in a nice big house。

And a lot of pretty girls there， and I remember I was sitting on the arm of a coach。

And there was three girls sitting on the couch， pretty maidens all in a row。

And the one I liked was the one in the middle， but I was talking initially to the one closest to me on this end。

And eventuallym going to start to turn my conversation to the wine in the middle。

So I'm sitting on the end of this couch talking to this girl。

 and she was a fun girl and we're having a great conversation。

 she was pretty and lively and it was excellent。We're laughing and joking。And a guy came up to me。

Through the crowd， an acquaintance of mine， a guy that kind of knew me and I kind of know him。

And he walked up to me。And I said， Hi， how you doing， and he leaned down to me？"。

And he whispered in a stage whisper， a loud whisper。What are you doing， Z。

 I've never seen you pick up a fat check before。And he trundled off through the crowd。

I looked down at this wonderful， beautiful girl that I was been talking to。And I saw her face fall。

And it broke my heart， I saw her sadness。And I couldn't believe that he would say that。

And he was already gone， I grabbed it by the hand and I said， Come with me。

I picked her out of the coach， put my arm in hers like this。

And I spent the rest of the entire evening at the party with that girl。

 I ignored the other girl I was trying to see， I ignored all the girls there， I made her feel。

Like she was the most beautiful girl there， we were the life of the party。

 we were telling jokes and wandering around， introducing ourselves to everybody。

 she was my girl for that night。That's what I'm saying。

 when I say a natural seducer has compassion for women， they are all his girls。

 he takes care of them all。That's what I mean。You know Shahkespeare wrote， she's beautiful。

And therefore to be wooed。She is a woman and therefore to be one。

This is what he believes He knows that most women are not really 100% single。

 every woman that is even remotely pleasant to be around has a guy of some stripe somewhere。

She either has a husband or a fiancee or a boyfriend or。

AG she is seeing or a guy she is kind of dating or a guy she is sleeping with or a guy who likes her and she tolerates or a guy she can call。

You know， to wait for a woman to be completely single is to wait a long time。True。

 she might be newly single。But that is a very narrow window。

Most women will get involved on some level with someone。Very soon。

The enlightenlighted seducer recognizes this and gives it no further thought。They are all his women。

 they are all his girls。It is his mission to make women feel beautiful again。

It doesn't mean that he is going to steal her away from the guy she is with。

It just means that in his presence。She feels like a woman。He shares the secret of women。

They love men， they desire them， they desire sex as intimately and directly as any man。

Yet sometimes they must disguise it。This is because of society， friends， family， her career。

 she must hide it。He realizes that a woman is complicit in neuro seduction， she desires it。

 it's a very powerful frame of mind because when you believe that。They start to believe it too。

When you consider it like this。That they're all your girls。

 there is no such thing as picking a girl up。 She's already picked up。She's already your girl。

 do you respect that she's in a relationship。But she's still your girl， you have respect for her。

Okay， trait number two。Every true lover knows。That the secret to his power over women lies in the power they have over him。

Wow， that goes against everything that we've been taught， I' the prize。She's just another girl。

 she has no power over me， right？Right。In theory。That is correct。But in practice。

The notion of being unable to control your desires around her can be very seductive。

Every seducer from Cassonnova to George Cloney recognized the power of showing a little vulnerability to a woman。

And they used it very consciously。He comes across as being delighted by women， that's the way he is。

 and truly he is delighted by women， he is delighted by the way they flow through life and the way they occupy this world。

Their essence enams and enchants him。And in return。He can't help us celebrate them。 That's the key。

 he can't help it。 He lets it be known that he is delighted by her。

He genuinely likes women and men that like women are liked by women。

The trick is not to overcompate to be too vulnerable。

 you don't want to come across as inept or pathetically needy。

Just occasional flashes of vulnerability or non smoothness in her presence。

This is because men who exhibit no weakness to a woman can sometimes be intimidating to her。

She might reject you to prove a point。And to bring it down to a level of humanness again。

She feels intimidated。And vulnerable sometimes。And she mistrusts a man who doesn't sometimes display a human side as well。

So you may have massive experience with women， you might know exactly what to do or say in every situation。

You still can't come across as too smooth， too rehearsed。Instead。

 naturals occasionally display a little weakness。You know， Carrie Grant。

When asked the secret of his success of women。He replied， I tell him I can't get it up。

The enlightenlighted seducer enters into every one of his romantic adventures with newness and excitement。

Like it is this first level over again。He knows that the impact he makes on her and that she makes on him。

Willll resonate with both of them for years。And will he be hurt？

Will you feel the pangs of loss when it ends， of course？But he loves it all just the same。

 he portrays an intense need for her， but he is not needy。

There is not the slightest hint of neediness about him。Note the distinction， he needs her。

 he's not needy。Yes， he puts her on a pedestal， but it is a pedestal。Of his own choosing。

That is the way I conduct my life and my actions， remember， this is consciously done。

I am completely unrestrained with women and having enormous fun。I am a slave to my love to women。

And they can sense it。The weakness of women is language and words， fortunately。

That is the skill that can be strengthened。And I never ever worry about a woman's resistance to me。

If she says she is not interested in leaves， I understand。But whenever I see her again。

I immediately go up to her， smile and wink and pick up right where I left off just like I never she had never resisted me in the first place。

 because that would have been unthinkable。In other words。

Her boyfriend objections or whatever mean nothing to me， they're just words。

Anybody that knows me very well knows that I usually don't play hard to get。

I tell a girl right away that I like her。I directly state my desires to hurt。

The key is to smile and win and say it in a way that conveys desire but gives her the impression that if she turns your offer down。

 you're not going to worry about it for even two seconds。She knows that you'll simply walk away。

And inevitably， as you pursue this theme further with her。

You will be asked why you were attracted to her。A normal guy would say something like。

  you have a beautiful smile， that's why I like you or whatever， this is what I do instead。

She'll she'll be talking to me， she'll， yeah， I'm an accountant over it。

At which point I interrupt her and cut her off because I love cutting girls off in mid sentence。

And I'll say she's telling me she's an accountant and I'll say， listenten， you've got of cute。

 I'm starting to like you， I want to see you again。And she's like taking aback and she'll say。

 you always is direct？Are you so interested in me？🎼Like， h。I have no idea。 I'm stumped。

 That's exactly what I'm trying to figure out。 I don't know what it is about you。

 but I'm trying to figure that out。That's the kind of thing I say to a girl。Trade number three。

He has a purpose in life。That isn't her。It doesn't mean he doesn't focus on her or delight in her。

But he's going on an adventure to the jungle to see what magic he can find。

 and he would love it if she came along。But if she doesn't， that's okay。

He's sad and he'll miss her because she's cute。She should come。But he's going anyway。

You see the reason women are so enamored by so called jerks。Is because they like the fact。

That he has drama in his life。That isn't her。He is too caught up in himself。

To spend much attention on her and so she gets busy trying to correct it。

Now the mistake most men make is that they get a girlfriend。And then they make her the adventure。

She becomes the sole purpose and meaning of his life and his hope for the future。

They stop what they are doing and focus only on her and women don't want that。

 they don't want to be the adventure。They want to go on an adventure。

 they want you to take them on an adventure， they want to be caught up in something exciting。

 something larger than themselves。Something that allows them to escape。Their banal existence。

But understand this guys， my attitude and my whole approach to a girl is along the lines of。

 you know， you're kind of hot。I think he'd make a good girlfriend for me。

I may not be the one you're with forever， but I will be the one you always remember。

I'll take it in an adventure girl， I'm going anyway。And I'd love you to come because you're cute。

But if you'd rather not， I understand。Just remember， you'll always have a fan out there， me。

The key here is there are two ways you can approach a woman， one with self confidence。

Or two with smug assumption。You can never let number one degrade into number two。🎼今来みんなほ。

Whatever your loss， lots of women out there。I'm the prize。Yes， it's true， it is her loss。

Because you're a nice guy。But it's my loss too， I liked you， I had all these plans。

 I was going to take you everywhere I show you off to all my friends。

 make you wear tight little skirts， it was great， I had it all figured out it's your loss too but you got to go anyway。

Trade number four。He realizes that honesty。Is the greatest aphrodisiac。

His biggest fear is to be perceived as just another man， he is not like other men。

 nor does he aspire to be if he thought for a moment that she regretted her encounter with him in any way。

Or somehow felt sad or hurt because of him。It would break his heart；

 He can't bear the thought that a woman would ever feel she was manipulated by him。

And yet he doesn't mask his desires as a man， he never portrays indifference or apathy。

🎼In an attempt to sneak under the wire， instead。He embraces his sexuality。

 presents it to her without presumption。Hes delighted if she responds favorably because she's cute。

 but deeply respectful if she does not。He would never lie to a girl to get her into bed， never。

If a woman opens herself up to him physically and emotionally， he doesn't take that lightly。

 he has a lot of respect for that。He knows he can do a lot of damage by being dishonest in his intentions or about the future。

You can hurt her heart。And she trusts you not to。You can take advantage of her vulnerability， yes。

 and get yours because you are a pickup artist。But you will hurt her heart and sadden her a little more。

You will color all her future interactions with men。It's kind of like peeing in the pool。

 everyone has to swim in it。A recurring event in my life is a woman saying this to me。

I can't believe I just told you that I just met you。I've never told that to anyone before。

This is because she knows I would never take advantage of her in any way。

 never betray her confidentiality， never use it to manipulate her in any way she's comfortable around me。

Where I've heard this a lot too。I can't believe I just slept with you on the first night I met you。

 I'll ask， why did you？I don't know， you were just different。This is a recurring theme in my life。

 somehow she absolutely understands that I will respect her in the morning。

And that I have a very high regard for her。And that I'm interested in experiencing all the delight she has to offer as a young。

 vibrant， central woman， and it's not just about sex。Everything about her is delicious。

 I convey that to her。She picks up on it。I'm different than other men。In my experience。This honest。

 unthreatening， direct approach， women will open right up。

The whole notion of waiting a while before you get intimate with her at this point becomes moot。

I never feel it went too fast and strangely enough。Neither does she。

 She's comfortable enough to open herself up to me。Honenesty is the greatest aphrodisiac。

 a woman knows in five minutes where I'm all about。

She knows she can't put me into that category of let's just be friends。 She doesn't even try。

 This is because I am honest and I let her know my intentions immediately。

How do you let a girl know that you are honest？I tell her right away。

I tell her I'm not like other men。She will believe you。

If you are sincere and stay with enough authority， I tell her this say。🎼Listen。

What you need to know about me is that I am very honest。I don't know what the future holds。

 but I know I like you。You might type。And you realize if you hang around with me。

You and I are going to get together。Feel that。I might not be the one you were with for the rest of your life。

But I will be the one you remember。You know， I talk about how honesty is the most important thing you can learn in your dealings with women。

 it's true， it is。It truly is the number one aphrodisiac honesty， having said that。

 I lie all the time。More correctly， it is important to get caught telling lies all the time。

I just let the girl catch me in the lie and smile and wake at her， in fact。

 I always say things in such a way that the girl is never really sure if I'm telling the truth or not。

Here's an example of what I'm talking about。A girl says to me， What sign are you？Me， I would say。

 yes。She say， Libra or whatever。What that's amazing， how did you guess that I am a Libra？Really。

 I got it right。So when's your birthday？And I will say something December。You lied。

 you aren't a Libra， I'm not smiling and wink at her， I'm not。What。She，"No I knew you were lying。

 she's pretending to be offended。And I'm like， hmm， well， tell you what， then。

Come give me a kiss and I'll forgive you， smile and wink。And she'll say。

 but you were the one that lied。Yeah but you're right。Find me a drink and we'll call it even。

That's the kind of ban you want to get going。You want to get her to the point where she's pretending to be offended。

 but then you're in。She catches you in white lives， you're honest， but you kind of tell lies。

Here's a real life example。From a while ago at a very crowded nightclub。

I was trying to make my way to the bar to order a drink and it was really busy。

And I was just about there when a girl tapped me on the shoulder。I turned around and she was hot。

And not only was she hot， but she was there with some very pretty girlfriends as well。

 There's three of them all together。 I'm like， well， hello。So she smiles sweetly at me and says。Hey。

 I think you should let me and my friends go ahead of you today because today is my birthday。

And I smiled even more sweetly and said， really。Well， that's weird because today's my birthday too。

Really， no I don't believe you， what's your sign and I'm like， hm， let's see， Gemini， Capricorn， Leo。

 Scorpio。She pretends to be offended at my line and she says， I knew it， and it's not your birthday。

Me pretending to be sorry， All right， you caught me， I am lying。It's not my birthday。

 so she's laughing and she says， well， I guess that's okay， it's not my birthday today either。

It's really tomorrow， but we're celebrating today。So now you have to let us go ahead of you to the bar。

And I'm like， I don't think so， you lied to me about your birthday。But so did you？Yes。

 but you lied first。Then I turned around and ordered my drink。And as I was walking away， I said。

" see a birthday girl。It's fun。And I didn't give into what guys would normally do。 Okay。

 go ahead of me just this one time， though， they're trying to still be cool。

 Now I's let you through this one time， but I would never normally do that。

I don't do that and because I didn't give in。Those girls followed me around all night。

So be very honest。But get caught telling lies if you know what I mean。🎼Trade number 5。

He never kisses and tells。Ever。He feels no need to validate himself to other men by bragging about his exploits。

🎼He never kisses in Dallas， his encounters with women。

Are never about bolstering his own self esteem or adding another notch to his bed post。

It is all about respect， this is because he is not interested in taking something but always in sharing something with her。

For he knows that all experiences in life are amplified once they are shared。

If she doesn't feel like a queen。He doesn't feel like a king。he is never out to get laid。

 that is the goal。His only desire is to share to interact with the beautiful woman。

 he believes that if a woman trusts him enough to open herself up to him physically。And emotionally。

It is a profound thing。Having said that， if she tells other people。It is actually very good。

He has nothing to hide， he is not ashamed of his love for women。

Understand what I'm saying when I say he never kisses and tells。It's important。

 understand the principle behind it。Not that you care are the people that hear about it。

Why does a natural never go around telling people that she slept with him？Respect。

That's why respect for her。You see a man can sleep with lots of women and he's a stud。

If a woman does the same， she's a slut。Unfair double standards， to be sure。So it is。

So out of respect for her and her reputation， he never kisses and tells。You know。

 a lot of guys will go on a date with a girl， get a kiss on the cheek good night and then brag to their buddies。

 high five， yeah， she was all over me。I lie the other way。

My friends asked me how it went with a girl the night before。I always just say，It was really nice。

 I really like her。She's a cool girl， she's a really nice girl。In fact。

 my friend is known not to even bother to ask me anymore。

So how do you let her know that you never kiss and tell， I tell her。

From one of the things I tell right away， I'm very discreet。Let her do it。In fact。

 if a woman says to me， " wow， that was amazing。I always laugh and say，Don't tell me。

 tell all friends。What is the biggest reason a girl will give you any last minute resistance of sleeping with you。

 you know even know that feeling we've all been there。

 we've all heard a de clched phrase and this is why you won't respect me in the morning。

Think about that。Think about what she is saying， that fear looms large on the horizon of most women。

 she is so afraid。That you're going to convince her to have sex with you。

 then depart hastily right then or in the morning。And the next day。

 go around and brag to all your buddies how cool you are and how easy she was。She's afraid of that。

Theres a very big concern for women。Think how devastated a nice girl will feel。

They have to worry about appearing too easy and about the reputation you don't have to。Well。

 I have this notion and you can bet that all natural seducers throughout history have this notion as well。

I have had this notion。And I believe it is a rarity in most men。The notion is this。

 a woman has sleeps with me。A woman that trusts me， me， me， enough to open her body。

 her emotions and her heart to me。Well， that is a very profound thing。

That is something that can never be taken lightly， you have to hold her and her emotions very carefully in your hands。

Your goal should always be to leave her better than you found her。That my friends is to respect。

And a woman that senses this from you will open herself up to you in ways you never dreamed。

The whole concept of last minute resistance goes right out the window， no such thing。See。

 she already likes you， she wants to be intimate with you。She wants it very much。

But she needs to feel that you respect her。And a true seducer knows the secret of women， it is this。

If she knew， if she really believed that no one would ever find out not her friends， not her family。

 not her coworkers。She will open herself up to you in amazing ways。

 that's why these guys never kiss and tell。This is why women will artificially and arbitrarily put a time limit on how soon they will sleep with you。

 it is common for her to want to wait three dates or so because she feels if she waits that long。

And if you buy her dinner in a movie three times， the chances are slimmer that you're going to just get yours and then leave her。

Well I tell you this， if I really like girl， there is no way I want to wait three days to enjoy intimacy with her。

 I like her， I'm excited by her。That just isn't in my nature。I'm a bond Dva。I like to live well。

And I like to experience everything。And it's entire。

I always explained to a girl that I am not content to just look at her。

I make new apologies for my desires as a man。I explained to her that I love life。

And have no desire to bridle my enthusiasm for life。I will tell her something like this。🎼I will say。

It is not in my nature to experience things only partially。I am a lover of life。

 I like to live well and I need to experience everything in its entirety。

If I travel to another country， for instance， I don't stay on the tourist track。

I can't help but immerse myself fully into the culture。To absorb it through my skin， to breathe it。

 to live it。To fade into it， a woman to me is like wine， like a fine wine of the rarest vintage。

 I can't be content with just looking at her。I absolutely must experience this wine on all levels。

 I need to smell it。To draw in the exquisite bouquet to carefully observe its clarity and color。

 its texture and nuance。And finally， I must drink it all in。Svoring every drop， tasting it。

 experiencing it。Breathing it， living it。Fading into it。Make new apologies for who you are。

Trade number six。He never defends himself ever， not from a reputation or from a challenge from her。

If she challenges him， he makes fun of her。For instance， if she accuses me of being a player。

 I laugh and say something like， what， so you do know who I am， you lied？"，He never defend it。

 deflect it， he never defends himself from a reputation when accused of being a player or whatever。

He neither denies nor confirms。He makes fun of the situation， you have no need to defend yourself。

You know who you are。By defending yourself， you validate it。

The most I'll ever defend myself is something like this， here's an example conversation。

I'll say something like this to a girl I'll sayYou know what I'm all about。

 I'm the most honest guy you've ever met， I'm not like other guys。

 most guys will hide their natural impulses because they really like you and they want to give you a good impression。

I don't， the difference between me and them is that I really like you。

 and I let it be known I don't hide my desires。And she'll say something like，So you're a player。

I never play with emotions， I desire you。That much is true。I very much want you to stay。

 but if you go， I understand。Either way， you have my highest respect but you should stay。You're cute。

And she will say something like。I don't want to just be another one of your girls。I understand。

Listen， I like you a lot。You're definitely my type of girl， I want to see you now and in the future。

 I can only promise you two things。Number one。I will never lie to you。

Or play with your emotions and number two。I will take you higher than you've ever been。🎼Yeah。

You see an enlightened seducer knows the truth that he never plays with a woman's emotions。

And because he knows this， he is at peace with himself。

And he has no need to attempt an apology or justification for the way he is he loves women。

 he desires neither empathy nor absolution or even understanding。He has no need to defend himself。

Because women。Are his greatest defendants。🎼Never respond to her challenges。

 Here's another example of a story。At bar one time and I was leaning kind of like on the bar and out of the corner of my eye。

 I saw this girl making a bee line through the crowd towards me and I thought。

Oh I here comes struggle and so I stood up and I'm standing there and sure enough she came and tapped me on the shoulder and I turned around。

And she said，  excusecus me， are you Z？And I said， yes， and she says， I thought so。

 you tried to pick up my friend Judy。And I'm like， really， was I successful？And she's like， no。

 she saw right through your little games right away and I said to her I said  well yo。

 maybe I was trying to get to Judy but really to get to Judy to get to you。

 to get to know you and she laughs and she says， she says no as if your little games wouldn't work on me。

 you think you're this guy and so she was giving me all these challenges and stuff that and I said to her and said "You know I think my games would work on you quite well actually。

"，And she says。🎼And。She said，  I don't think so， she said， " okay， if you think you're so good。

 she says， go ahead， say something， say something， try and seduce me。🎼え。And so I said， okay。

 now I'll respond to that， so I leaned into her and put my arm around her like this。

 and I'm leaning right in and I'm right in close to her face。And I said to her kind of whispering。

 I said，Did you？Did you come through the crowd just now to come say hello to me， come talk to me？

And she said。Yes。And I said，  then I've already seduced you and I walked away。Trade number seven。

He never takes himself， her， or the situation seriously。

He is not afraid to use self deprecating humor。Everything is said with a smile and a wink。

 like an inside secret that they both share。The ability to make fun of yourself。

That's important he who laughs at himself will never cease to be amused。

What most men don't understand is this。When a woman says in dating profiles or magazine surveys polls。

That she likes a sense of humor in a man， this is what she's talking about。

 a man who has the confidence to make fun of himself。The true seducer understands us。You know。

 we try and be too cool。We try to make jokes at others's expense。

That is not the type of humor that women find attractive。

You knowAntonio Vananders when interviewed about the movie Zorural。He said。

The thing that makes Zorvo appealing。Or anyone appealing。Is a sense of humor。It's so important。

That Zorro has the capacity of laughing at himself。If you can't do that。

Their character becomes arrogant。This is critical。It's critical。

 and as Robert Green said about seduces in his classic work， the Art of seduction。He said。

 all have a sense of style。And self depre。A quick example is when you go up to a girl somewhere and she lets you know she's not interested。

 most people get rejected and walk away， I just say something like whatever like， oh man。

 I can never get girls。You just make fun of it this whole situation。

Now this is very misunderstood whenever I say this in a talk in a city somewhere invariably。

I have guys coming up to me afterwards saying， listen， I agree with everything you said。

 it was wonderful except。The part。Of making fun of myself， I would never do that。Well。

 that's why you have no girlfriend。Be very clear that I am not talking about neurotic self eacing self degrading humor。

 Allla Woody Allen， not talking about that， that's not what I mean。That's putting yourself down。

 that's different I'm talking about having enormous fun in life with it without her。

 laughing at her and at yourself。It portrays confidence。

It demonstrates that you are used to winning on a level that no amount of posing beside your porsche with your cool shades and flexing your lats could ever do。

She was confidence。Another example that I could give you to demonstrate what you should act like if a girl is pretending to be offended。

 if you've kind of maybe crossed the line a little bit。

 so if I'm talking to a girl and I got my hand on her back and I'm like， you know。

 you're kind of cute， you and I should get together and she'll say something like hold on。

 I just told you I just told you I'm married。"，Ptending to be offended。

 you pretend to be sorry and go， I know， you know， hold out your hand for her to slap it or slap your own hand。

 I can never get girls， say something like that。Trade number eight。

He realizes the massive importance of body language。He studies that carefully。

There was a study conducted in England， a scientific study that says that communication is 93% body language。

In other words， they say that 55% of a person's judgment is based on visual perception。

 that is how you look and how you stand and how you approach her。And 38% is based on your voice tone。

Only 7% of the impression you make on a woman depends on what you actually say。

 that's why opening lines are irrelevant。Now one doesn't need to be a rocket scientist to quickly realize that of 93% of the impression we make has to do with our looking all right and talking in a certain way。

Then women are relying on their senses。To form your opinions about us。Not what we say at all。

Many women will in fact decide whether or not they like us during the first 10 seconds。

It seems incredible that what we have to say to her when introduced。Has so little consequence。

She already has an impression of you。But naturals know this。

He knows that a man falls in love through his eyes， but a woman falls in love through her ears。

Body language is everything。The natural seducer focuses on her， like there is no one else。

In the world。He is a master of his body language and voice intonation， he leans into her。

Inviting her to share herself in return。He smiles with his eyes and his whole being。

This is the essence of charm。The aura that some people give off， he knows this and practices it。

Eye contact is so important。We don't use it enough。Eye contact is huge。Smile and wake her。

Here's an example of the way I would approach a girl。In a club or a party or whatever。

 I always immediately touch them。My hand is on her back the moment before I say anything。

 I always moving in from the side， some guys will approach from the front with their drink。

 whatever and they'll say hi， how are you doing and what's your name， et cetera。

 they kind of do that some guys approach indirectly from behind。So that they don't I don't know。

 I approach kind of naturally from the side and so when I'm talking to a girl I'm not directly talking to her like this。

 I'm on the side like this and I kind of rock in， I don't know how supposed to describe it I'm just like hello。

 what's your name？"，And as I do， my hand is on the small of her back immediately。

That's where my hand is， the moment I talk to the girl， doesn't matter who it is。

 I'm touching her hand is on small bat。And。That's the first thing I do。

 and then I'm talking to her kind of on the side like this。

 and I lean out and I'll come back in again to say something。

It's just the way I kind of do it and when you do that when you're used to putting your touching girls。

 I guess， putting your hands on them， I always do the small of the back。

 I never you know like the shoulder or elbow or hold the hand， I don't do anything like that。

 I just touch a small over the back。It's the way I do it， and it becomes natural。

 they allow it because it's the way you are。If you never， ever。

If you meet a girl and you never approach her in that familiar way。

 and then you try and do it later on in another encounter， for instance， with her， she'll kind of go。

 why are you touching me？But with some guys， it's just natural that they do that。

And women will allow it， if they're like， that's the way he is and they don't even notice it。

Here's an example of what I'm talking about when I say that women will allow men certain liberties that they would never allow other men。

I was standing in a crowded nightclub one time with two beautiful girls who had just met they knew each other。

 and I had one on this hand here and one on this side， and I was talking to these two girls。

And we had a good rap and we were laughing and having fun。And all of a sudden one of the girls says。

 let's get out of here and go in the corner over there or somewhere else。

 because that guy coming through the crowd， we don't like him。And I looked and sure enough。

 coming to the crowd was a guy and he was kind of looking around for the girls and he was heading towards us。

And I said， well， what's matter with him， why don't you girls like that guy？And they said， well。

 we don't like him because。He's always got his hands on us， he's always touching us， we call him Mr。

 grpy。And we just don't like that。I laughed。Because at the very same moment that they said that。

And I pointed it out to them， I had my hand on the small of each of their back with my little finger kind of tucked into the jeans and I had since the moment I met them。

 I had been touching them the whole time and I laughed and I said to them I said， "Liten。

 you call him Mr。 Grooppi， I've been touching you guys since I met you。"。

And they laughed as well because they realized what they had just said and they said， well。

 they didn't notice， they said， we didn't notice you were touching us because with you it was different。

 it seems more natural。And that's a difference， that's what I'm talking about when women will allow certain liberties to men。

Who have good intentions and are having fun。As a opposeder guys。

 we're trying to take something from them and gr up them， Mr。 Groby。Trade number nine。

He knows that women are not attracted to men who are good looking。

They are attractive to men who are attractive。Big difference。You know。

 we have this notion that all successful seducers must have been good looking。

A quick study of the history of the great seducers will disabuse you of that notion immediately。

History is replete with examples of men who are not good looking at all， who are too short。And yet。

 who could seduce any woman they desired。So some of the most notorious woman Is out there were just playing looking guys or even quite ugly。

Look at some of the painting of Casanoa。Not what we would call a very good looking guy。

But Casanova said this about himself， he said this。I was not handsome。

But I had something better than beauty， a striking way of expressing myself。

Which always compelled interest in my favor。Now， considering his first sexual encounter。

 was a threesome with two nuns。I would say he had a very compelling way of expressing himself。

Jean Paul Sart， the great philosopher and even greater ladies man， was notoriously beastly ugly。

 and yet women fell at his feet。He was four foot nine。When I went this way， when I went that way。

 look at pictures of them。Go Google him， it has been written about him that women fell for him because he knew how to explain their soul to them。

 that's the secret。The language of women is words themselves， men fall in love through their eyes。

 women fall in love through their ears。Vololtaire said。

Give me five minutes to explain away my ugly face， and I can bend the Queen of France。No idle boast。

These guys were good。So don't ever let that be an excuse， some guys said to me in New York recently。

I feel like I am too short for women to be attracted。To me。I told him the only thing he was short on。

Was the will to cast off his self limiting beliefs？So those who playing and ugly men。

 and yet they have the ability to mesmerize everyone around them。Women， I have talked to you。

Have a term for guys like this。Now please know this is not something that most men are aware of。

 it is strictly a woman speak。They describe a man like this as being sexy， ugly。

This term is well known to women， but virtually unknown to men。

 there was a salon article that described the term。It said this。

  the sexy ugly guy is one who works on you in spite of yourself。Who shows up in your erotic dreams。

 not because you want them there。But simply because he's asserting his right to be there。

Women know within five minutes of meeting a guy whether or not they would sleep with them。

 they know right away。A girlfriend of mine once told me that women have this thing called the hover Factor。

This refers to a test they have that women have with a guy within 30 seconds of meeting him。

 it goes like this。If she can picture him， hovering over her is in a sexual position hovering over top of her。

She will be receptive to sleeping with him if everything works out that way。

If she can't get that picture of this guy hovering over her。She will never sleep with him， ever。

Here's an example of how powerful what I'm talking about can be。

This happened one time I was in a local pub with a friend。

And we just happened to meet up with another guy that he knew and the guy's fiance。

And she was gorgeous。So we were sitting around a small round table and the guy's fiance was sitting beside me to my left。

 roundund table。The guy was a across from me and my friend was on my right。

So we were sitting there talking and joking and carrying on and having some wine and getting to know each other。

My friend kept engaging the other guy in conversation。

So this girl and I were left talking to each other a fair amount。

She told me she was a massage therapist and she was running her business out of her home。So I said。

 hey， you know maybe she should come over and get a massage sometime， her boyfriend heard this。

And started talking about what a great massage therapist she was and how her business was just starting to take off and that yeah。

 I should go get a massage from her and I should tell all my friends。

So this carried on to the evening and we were had great before I was talking to this girl a lot。

 friendly banter。And then suddenly， three glasses of Piot and noir later。

 while the other two guys were talking and engaging each other。

 she started telling me something or other， and I could see in her eyes。

That there was something else。So I cut her off in mid sentence。She was telling me something。

 I cut her off mids and I said。You realize， of course。That you and I。Are going to get together。

I said this with a dead， serious look on my face， I'd cut her off in mid sense and I said that to her。

She looked absolutely stunned。She stared at me with her mouth hanging open。

And then after about five seconds， she quietly whispered。🎼Yes。Of course。

 I didn't fall through with it。But I just wanted to illustrate to you how powerful。

The mindset of a natural can be。When you have the skill set to be able to amplify attraction and to concentrate chemistry like that。

 it's very powerful， it's a very powerful thing to learn。Now we come to trade number 10。

To an enlightened seduccer。His relationships never end。Think about that for a second。

And natural realizer this， he is connected to the women in his life forever。

All men who are natural are friends with women。There is no animosity towards him。

 there are no hard feelings toward him， and they never say a bad word about him。

Even long after they are no longer together as a couple。How in the world is this possible？Here's how。

A woman would only feel cheated if she thought you promised something to her that you didn't deliver。

A woman will only say bad things about you if she thought。

She was going to get something that she didn't get。We make long term promises。On short term feelings。

But you， were're honest with her， you know， you don't know about the future。

And you gave her room to breathe， you respected her that much。

So his relationship with her never ends。As I said before， sure。

 he may not be with her physically throughout her life。But he has touched her so profoundly。

That she will always carry him around in her heart。

To all of her subsequent relationships and breakups， she will always think of you。

And Natural knows that he might not be the one she is with forever。

But he is the one she will remember forever。And that is a gift。A gift you gift to her。

And it gifts she gives to you。To give you an example of what I mean when I say that to a natural seducer。

 his relationships never end。Let me give you the example of my 40th birthday party。

 my girlfriend threw me a surprise birthday party on that day at my house。

What was cool about it was she invited。A whole bunch of my ex girlfriendriends。

 women that I used to have in my life。There was probably nine girls that came。To this party for me。

And what was cool about it？Was it was a lingerie party。

 my girlfriend knew me so well that she thought what better party to celebrate Zan's 40th birthday party than to have all his ex girlfriendends around him。

We're in lingerie， and I couldn't agree more。 It was one of the。Beautiful days of my life。

 it was profound， I remember looking around， it a surprise party。

 I didn't know it was going to happen， all these girls were there to celebrate me， me。

 and I was standing there。And looking around in the room and all these beautiful girls who have created who I am。

 who have added to my life immensely。And I thought， what a profound moment， this is the goal。

 this is what you want to create in your life， that kind of beauty， yeah。

 people move in and out of your life。That's irrelevant。

They brought beauty into your life and they're still beautiful today， you still miss them。

 you still adore them today， you still delight in them。

 they'll always be your friends and they'll always be with you forever。
