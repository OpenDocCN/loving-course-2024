# 【社交光谱】泰勒《蓝图解码2.0重铸蓝图》初级班：07_7.跳出自己的大脑：沟通自动化_ev

站起来了。🎼这里是社交光谱，我是莱特。这节课呢更多的是实操。这一集呢是关于一个实操的一个课程。关于泰勒去锤炼一个小黑哥啊，你们可以跟着一起来学习和锻炼，来掌握其中的一个技巧。

本节课呢讲了如何通过这个全身心的投入，融入语言，来提升演讲和沟通的表达力与感染力，告诉我们应该怎么去锻炼演讲和沟通，其中关键在于我们要跳出我们大脑的控制，全身心的投入，让语言和情绪啊，自由流露。

强者的世界里容不下半点焦虑。人生如戏，台上台下揭示演员。我们每时每刻都在用言语和行为来表达自己来影响他人。那么现在开始我们的蓝图解码2。0重铸蓝图之旅。

So you remember I said earlier， sharp as attack？And then that gets that initial hook from there。

 we can add in variation in cadence and tone。So。We're going to keep building these one after another after another after another。

 and it's really like maybe 10 things in speaking that if you just kind of lay it in brick by brick and then you integrate all of them。

 you're going to have it， you'll literally have it。

 It's just different tools you can play with that I played with over time right we're going to hit into projection。

 We're going to hit into tone use， We're going hit into giving energy into it。

 So the next one I want to show you and this is huge。😡。

Is how to bring electricity into the way that you're communicating if you want to do a video。

 if you want to meet somebody whatever it is， and this is not what I do all the time。

 but I want you to think of it like yang and yang。😡，Now， by the way。

 as you're seeing the way that I'm communicating now。

 are you noticing the variation in tone in projection， in cadence， in rhythm， Are we seeing that？😡。

Okay， so when you're first doing it， you're gonna be try hard with it。

 You're gonna be like kind of like your bambi baby deer legs with it。

 You're gonna be confused with it， right kind of you know， so you'll be like， hi yeah。

 I am oh you know， it's not gonna be natural right away。 you get it over time。

 It's like playing an instrument。 So as I'm speaking。😡，I can put emphasis。 I can put emphasis。

I don't just need to go louder and more crazy。go得 quiet。Make you feel like I'm telling you secret。

What's the secret？What's the thing no one knows？Why， am I so relaxed， I'm talking right now。

Do I know some of you don't？Where I can get all crazy right you know。

 there's so many different ways that I can do it to switch it up so you can make it like a television show。

 A great public speaker doesn't need to put a lot of music or graphics into their videos or speaking。

 If you look at big corporations， they're usually not gonna to have a world class speaker to do their videos So they're gonna to put a little drum roll behind it righty it's owe it。

😡，You know， graphic comes on oh and from this。You know。

 write some flashy images and they're doing that to actually to add stimulation to it。

 but a great speaker doesn't require that like a truly great rapper could wrap is it called acapella where there's no there's no beat right an amazing rapper could freestyle and you just be going crazy even if just some guy was just doing like you know just like a bit of drums like that and like literally you could be like you know and a rapper could just be going and people be going crazy versus if you're not a great rapper you need to have a great beat so I want to get it where you've got an incredible flow so the next step in this。

😡，Is I want to show you how to add electricity into what you're saying。

 and this is a combination of a basic level meditation practice and then merging that inter speaking。

😡，So。I want you to say with me right now， first thing I want you to do is clear your mind。

 take a nice， deep breath。😡，Notice my kid is there a nice， deep breath。 Okay。

 I'm gonna hold your attention here for days。 It's like a TV show。 The image keeps changing。

 You know， TV it changes the images every， every7 seconds or whatever it is to keep you getting dopamine。

 right， I'm gonna keep changing it。😡，You're not going to know what to expect， and because of that。

 you can be half dumb。And yet you'll be like， wow， when I'm learning from this teacher， I feel smart。

 I can pay attention for hours。Hs。I could pay attention for hours。I could pay attention for hours。

Pa attention for hours， pay attention for hours。Pay attention just for hours。

I' paying attention for hours。 Okay， we can keep switching it up。

And you don't want to make it incongruent， you want to feed energy and electricity into it。

 so what you do to feed energy into it is go present。

 take a deep breath and clear your mind because I'm not thinking what I'm speaking， by the way。

 I'll show you how to do that soon clear your mind Now just say this with me。😡。

I want you to put your full awareness， like a meditation practice that's active and active meditation into the word you're saying。

 So I'm going to say， merge into the word。 And as you do it。I want you to imagine like your。

Hooking up and you're about to climax。 Okay， you're hooking up。 You're about to climax。

 when you climax， you're like， like this。 Why do so many people。😡，Have a need to get off。

It's because they don't know how to get out of their heads。

And of you feel that way where like the major reason that you're attracted to intimacy is because you don't know how to escape your mind。

😡，It's one of the few ways that you can actually escape the heaviness of your mind。😡。

So a lot of the time， they'll say， oh， that person just， you know， wants to hook up。

 they're a pervert。 I think a lot of people that have a high drive to hook up。

 they're burdened by the mind。 And one of the few one of the few escapes from that is the repetitive motion of intimacy。

 Okay， the repetitive motion of intimacy。 What you have is a situation where。

You're not able to get out of your head and you can't get out of your head except in things that you're trained to use to get out of your head。

😡，So if you self stimulate。You don't however you're doing it。

Gurable I don't know what you're using right when you're self stimulating what you're doing is you trained yourself to go into almost a hypnotic trance and that trance is happening from the repetition Okay。

 that's why intimacy in out in out in out sound right I can't go too crazy because we don't want to get in trouble。

 but you see my main point， right？啊。It's okay if I'm making yourroususe guys， even though my guy。

 it's okay。아啊。啊。啊。Okay， you see what you're doing there right， It's arousal。 it's self- arousal。

 You can self- arouse or have a partner in arousal。 What are the common elements there。 Number one。

 you're trained to get out of your head when you do that。 See in intimacy。

 it would be weird to be in your head。 you'd be acting weird So you're trained not to be weird and act like that。

 So it's actually a socially condoned place to get out of the heaviness of the mind right we wouldn't think that in speaking。

 or maybe in socializing， we wouldn't think， oh， that's a normal place to let go of the burden of the mind。

 But to be a world class speaker or marketer or communicator or somebody with social skills。

 you've got to let go of the burden of the mind。 That's part of what makes it so attractive is that it then gets other people out of the burden of their mind。

 If you watch a great speaker， it should it might create intensity， joy， irreverence。

 but but it also creates lightness。 it actually a great speaker。

 you watch them after you're done watching them a lot of the heaviness of your problems。😡，Goes way。

 it offers perspective， it gives you altitude on the bigger picture。😡，Well。

 the way that you do that when you're speaking is that you've got to do what's called go first。

 say that word go first， go first， so you put yourself in that perspective of the bigger picture letting go。

😡，Everything's unfolding exactly as it should in that kind of mode。

 and so didn't quite hit the note there， but I can't close。

 so you see the point is that you've got to get yourself in that mode。

And so you have to merge into the word。Okay， it's like you're being physically intimate with the word。

 you're making love。To the word， okay and。The only place to make love in life is not just like。啊。啊。啊。

RightThat's not the only place you can do the same thing。😡，With your speaking。The same thing。

 you can be hitting a certain cadence。And as you're hitting that cadence。

 people are going into trance and you can be playful， just like you could in intimacy， right。

 you can do a little takeaway， right in intimacy， you can do a little takeaway or you can add energy。

 you can get crazy。 You can get raw。In more ways than one， you could be wrong And okay。

' more than one way。 And see， But look how can you ship。 There's more than one way， right。

 we can dial it back。 You see the playful。 You can be playful。

 unexpected in the moment and adding energy to it。 play with it。Play with it。Feed into it。

 merge into the word。 Okay， sometimes with stretching this can help us。

 So try saying the word merge into the word， Sa to me merge。wordSo okay， join the word。Integrates。

With your sentence， merge into your speaking。性就。Okay。最尖锐的攻击性语言呢能吸引听众的初始注意力。但接下来要在节奏和语调上来增加变化，避免单调。

我们要学会在语言中注入能量，这体现在语调声音的投射，以及节奏和韵律的变化上，就像顶级的说唱选手啊，不需要伴奏，就能即兴创作。我们出色的表达者呢，也可以通过语言本身就能制造出震撼人心的效果。

优秀的表达者可以在不同的语气和情绪间自由切换，时而疯狂，时而平静，却不需要大喊大叫，掌握这些技巧呢，需要时间和练习。刚开始我们可能会觉得不自然。那么下一节课呢就是实操环节的一个欣赏。
