然后我老公也是在一点点的呃受我的影响吧，也在一点点改变。然后现在我跟我老公现在的情况就是夫妻关系现在已经调整的，应该说呃很好了吧。但是有的时候也会有矛盾，呃，但是我呃矛盾过后。

我们两个就是恢复的比原来要快了很多。嗯ん。我先翻译一下。嗯嗯，好的好的，好，不好意思。没关系。 Al son is now 15 years old。

 and he's supposed to study at the third year of middle school。

 But since he has stopped going to school and now he's living with his grandparents。

 paternal grandparents and armed in the hometown。Donbe northeast part of China。

And studying in the local school in the second year of middle school。

 his problem began since he was in the fourth grade in primary school。And since he had problem。

 I had therapy myself for over half a year， but didn't really work out。 So didn't really work。

 So in 2018， I started to learn family education till now。 and for a year。

 I myself have been a family educator。 So during that process， I personally have developed a lot。😔。

Although sometimes my emotions still fluctuates， however。

 I do in improve and my husband in that process also got impacted。

 influenced by me and little by little he was also changing to now couple relationship has been greatly improved。

 although sometimes we still have conflicts， but we can restore our relationship sooner， faster。Yes。

 what is the essential problem with your son？你们的儿子最核心的问题是什么？嗯。他从其实他已经两次辍学了，第一次的时候是在初一的时候，初一的话嗯。

他是因为有一次作业没有完成，就不敢去上学了，然后就基本上就是一年待在家里面。其实这个在小学阶段，五六年级就开始了。他会因为白梦成作业，然后不想去，然后就是隔了几天或一个星期才去，或者有的时候他说肚子疼。

他不愿意去，就断断小学阶段是断断续续的，然后到初一的时候基本上就一整年不去了。然后那个时候正好是疫情刚开始，那一年呢，我跟我老公在家里都陪着他，然后家庭氛围都还挺好的。然后到了初二他又自己去上学了。

然后到初二上嗯初二的第一学期状态都挺好。然后学习也很认真，也很努力，到了二年级，初二下学期的时候。就感觉孩子忽然又发生了一些变化，就是原先。回到家里面都按时完成作业的。然后后来呃回到家里面。

他不愿意写作业了，就自己一个人静静的在那看书。然后因为前期他有辍学的那个经历嘛，就是我跟老公就不太敢去干涉他。然后我就会认为他是不是就是因为因为学业的压力去上学。但是我我也跟班主任沟通过，班主任说嗯。

孩子在学校里面没有看出什么呃就异样的情况。嗯，因为他性格比较内向嘛，在学校里面下课的时候，一直都是自己一个人。呃，看看书呀或在座位上写作业呀，就是很少跟同学在一起。所以孩子现在这个状况。

他也觉得孩子没有什么异样的状态。对 I'm so sorry that I don't speak Chinese。你你得说一段停一段，然后再可以接着说的。

因为你大段说老师就要等很久下来我也翻译没关系 actually， the problem has occurred several times。

 at least twice in the beginning， fifth sixth grade。

 he stopped going to school for several days because of stomachache or not being able to fulfill the homework。

 So he he didn't dare to go to school。 Sometimes he would take a break for a week staying at home。

 And then the second time was in the first year of middle school。

He wasn't able to fulfill his homework again， So he didn't dare to go to school。

 So he stayed at home for a year， a whole year。 That was the beginning of pandemic。

 So he stayed at home with both me and my husband， his father。 It went very well。

 The Family atmosphere was good。😔，And then the second year of middle school， the next year。

HeHe went back to school on his own somehow for some reason。 and the first semester went well。

 Everything was good， but somehow for some unknown reason in the second semester。

 everything stopped to happen once again， He start to have difficulties to deliver homework。

 and instead of doing homework after school， he would be doing some readings on his own in his own room。

 And because of the problem that has occurred before， he stopped going to school for a year。

 So neither me or my husband dared to interfere with his problem And we wondered to ourselves。

 what's the problem， Is it too much stress for him studying at school。

 So we contacted teacher asking what's going on in school。 And teachers asked everything's the same。

 no difference。 he still an introvert boy doing reading on his own in school。

 not much communication with his classmates in the classroom。Okay， so the little that I understand。

到目前为止只有我的一点点了解。Mom is like this。妈妈像是这样。Dad is like this。爸爸再靠后一点， and your son is like this。儿子呢是这样的。

And what you want for your son is for him to be like this。而你们希望儿子也能够像这样。But he's been like this。

但这段时间他一直是这样。And now he's living with his grandparents。现在他跟爷爷奶奶一起生活。Yeah。

 now this puts a lot of stress on the two of you。这就为你们两个人带来了很多的压力。

We could say that three points are stable。我们可以说，如果有三个支点呢，这个架子就很稳。 when there's two points。那如果只有两个支点。

 it's not stable。就不稳了， you're in a situation。Where your heart is involved。你们现在所处的这个情况，你们的心投入进去了。

 and your heart goes out to your son。你们的心去往儿子那里， and you don't know how to help him。To be like this。

而且你们又不知道要怎么样帮助他成为这样。 But now he's outside of the family。但是现在呢他又不生活在这个家里。

 and you're hoping that being with his grandparents in North China。你们希望他在东北和爷爷奶奶在一起。

Will give him an opportunity是这的不是这样的。对我师说嗯，你们希望通过在东北和爷爷奶奶在一起。

会给他一个机会来成为这样not like thathe say not like that。嗯，不是这样的，嗯，我能给你解释一下吗？Can I explain it to you。Yes。好。

继须是是这样的，因为他初二结束过以后，他那个就暑假的时候，他跟我提过，说妈妈我要转学，因为二夏的时候他成绩特别差嘛，他提出转学的话，我没有太重视这个问题。因为我会认为他是因为成绩的原因。

然后等刚呃我来我来翻译一下嗯嗯嗯。嗯。😊，Actually， at the end of the second year of middle school。

 during a summer vacation， my son had proposed to me that he wanted to go to another school。

 be transferred to another school to continue the study。

 because he wasn't having good marks in school， but I didn't take it seriously。嗯，因为快开学了嘛。

办转学是一个非常棘手的一个问题，就没有办好。然后孩子就不愿意去上学了。Because it was approaching the end of summer vacation and the new semester is coming。

 It was a very difficult period for me to make arrangement for him to study。 in another school。

 So I didn't really do it。 And the new semester began。 it was very difficult for him。

 He didn't go to school。😔，嗯，那所以他也不去上学的话，那就只能呆在家里。然后因为我跟我老公要上班嘛，后来那个孩子的姑姑就是说可以让孩子回老家，因为姑姑是在当地一个中学。

当副校长，他可以有这样的一个一个便利条件，所以我们也就同意了，孩子自己也就同意了，然后就回老家，就是重新上了一个初二，现在再继续继续上学。然后呃就是上完句话过一嗯嗯嗯，谢谢嗯。

Because he didn't go to school so he had to stay at home but Boman and husband to go to work so he had to stay at home alone and that was a problem so the aunt from hometown was the vice president of the middle school and she suggested that our boy can go stay there so that it's convenient for him to go to the middle school that the aunt was here it's more convenient for her to make the transference so we agreed in our son grade too so now so since then he started studying in the local middle school beginning at second year middle school it's like redoing the whole year。

Yeah。那个我我是想让孩子就是在那上完初二课以后，回到我们身边来上初三的。但是因为孩子成绩呢呃就是落的比较多，可能成成绩不是很好。然后在老家，因为那边是农村嘛，可能学习压力比较小一些。呃。

也就是我的公公婆婆，包括我老公可能会认为在那边继续上高中会容易一些。呃，但是我是想让他回来，孩子自己呢可能也觉得在那边学习会轻松一些，他自己好像也更倾向于在那边学习。Actually。

 I had wanted him to come back to us after one year of studying there in the local middle school。

So that he could come back to us in the third year of middle school。

But both parenting law and my husband and himself wanted to continue there because it's easier。

 they're less stressful and local classmates and the curriculum was easier for him to follow。

So he didn't really want to come back。It is not easy to be a mother of a child with special needs。

做这样一个有特别的需要的孩子的母亲，并不是一件容易的事情。Let's say that I am your son。比如说我是你的儿子。

And you're speaking to me from your heart。而你在从自己的心出发，在对我说话， and you want to condense the message。同时呢。

你在说的时候，把自己想要传递给我的信息浓缩Im your boy。我是你儿子， What is the simple message that you're communicating to me。

如果你用很简单的话语，简洁的向我传递，你想要向我沟通的，你会怎么说啊？ use a minimal amount of words。尽可能少短的句子。哦，明白。嗯，那个我来老师您好，那个我来说吧，好吧。

就是刚才我爱人介绍了一下我们家孩子的情况，但是他没有说到关键点，我们我们想就是主要是因为我们孩子第二次不上学，是因为在学校里头，他觉得有同学呃，就是在语言上伤害了他，他产生了恐惧，不敢去上学。

老师请您先翻译一下，好吧嗯。May I tell you something else， teacher。

 Because I don't think my wife have told you the key。

And what I see as the key is in the second time that the problem happened。

 there was some hurt feelings that our son received from a classmate in school。

 The classmate said something hurt for to him so that he didn't dare to go to school。

So he's a sensitive boy。对以他是一个很敏感的孩子。对是 has very gentle heart。有一颗非常温柔的心，柔软的心。

 What is the message that you've been trying to give to your son。那一直以来，你们想要传递给儿子的信息。

信息是什么 that you want him to get from you。你们希望他能够收到的来自你们的最核心的那个忠告是什么？我们家孩子他比较敏感，完了哦在初二下学期的时候有有所恐惧。

或者在初三开学的时候，呃就呃不想去上学了，想转学或者没转学成就回老家了，回老家他好像感觉更安全，在那边性格变得更开朗了。上学的话嗯，也还可以。嗯，在一个就是我们想核心想请教老师的事，我们跟孩子的沟通。

因为我我们夫妻俩的话，平时不说关键问题的时候可能不拌嘴。但是一说到孩子啊或者什么的话，我们俩经常会争吵嗯。嗯。

Our son is a very sensitive boy and in the second year of middle school。

 he got scared and because of the fear he didn't go to school the next year。

 So I think he felt safe in the hometown with the local students and teacher so that he got more open there and doing well in school。

 doing okay in school， So I would want to ask teacher for advice for us to have better communication with our son。

 because between us， the couple here we argue over our son or any other topics we can talk well。

 we can commute well with each other。Yes， this is your are too dead。Your son is your heart。是啊。你的儿子。

你们的儿子也是你的心爸爸。对你来说， it seems to me。That you want him to develop his strength。我看到的是。

似乎你是想要培养出儿子的力量 and to be less sensitive，让他不再那么敏感。And this is a place where the two of you agree。

只在这一点上，你们两个人是能达成一致的意见， but you might have different perspectives about how to accomplish this。

至于要如何实现这个结果，你们两个人可能会有不同的意见。嗯，对，我们最大的分歧就在这，就是每一次我们在讨论有关孩子的问题的时候，我们的分歧是很大的。That's right。

 This is our biggest difference。 And every time when we talk about our son。

 there is a very big difference。I don't see the difference。现在我没有看到你们的分歧。I see。 mutual concern。

我看到的是你们两个人共同的一致的关心嗯。在心中想要去解决这件事， and he does not have a lot of insulation。Insulation。

Like a wire has insulation。而且他没有太多的。就像电线外面的那个绝缘的包裹的那个塑料绝缘。

And if the wire doesn't have enough insulation。如果电线没有足够多的包裹。

It doesn't take a lot of power for the wire to short。Have a short circuit。那么绝缘做的不够好。一点超过一定限量的电流通过之后。

那个电路很容易就短路了。And so if I put my hand in salt water。如果我把手伸进盐水， I wouldn't feel anything。我什么都不会感觉到。

But if my skin was irritated。但如果我的皮肤上面有破损， and I put my hand in salt water。我还把这个手伸进盐水。It would burn。

那会非常疼的。 Now， your son seems to be a highly sensitive person。你们的儿子似乎是一个极其敏感的人。

And as two mature adults。你俩是成熟的成年人，You're both strong people。

你们两个都是非常强大的人 and both of you have sufficient insulation。你们两个人周围呢都有足够的绝缘体包裹着。somehow your son doesn't。

但出于某个原因，儿子没有。And so problems at school。所以在学校发生的问题， and then he reacts strongly。他会有非常强烈的反应。

 because he has such a sense of heart。因为他有一颗非常敏感的心。没有。I still don't clearly understand。那到目前为止。

我还没有很清楚的了解到 what is the mutual advice that you're giving your son。你们两个人会给儿子一些什么样的共同的建议呀？Seemingly。好像。

You want your son to be able to do this。你们想要儿子能够快速的恢复。If he gets hurt。如果他受了伤。

And what you want him to be able to do。你们会希望他能够做到这样。Is to bounce back quickly很快速的就恢复过来。

I don't know yet。我现在还没有得到确认，还不知道。Let me see You。 talk about this together。让我来看一看，你们俩一起来谈谈这件事儿。

turn towards each other。面对面做。And disagree about what should happen with your son。你俩面对面做，然后。

发表一下各自对于儿子要怎么样去处理不同的意见分歧。我们希望能帮助到我们家孩子，就是说怎么能让他对别人的一些看法，别那么敏感，能提高他的内心内心强大。这一个就是呃我们希望他就是能能逐步的更成熟一些。

就是说呃对一些呃同学呀，还有其他人的一些看法说法，呃，别。想的那么极端。We would both want our son to be less sensitive and to be stronger。

 to be more mature， to be relatively firm on its own position instead of caring about how other people think too much。

Yes， you basically want him to be more grown up。对，基本上你们想要的是他更成熟，像一个成年人。

 So you're in agreement about what you want for him。就对于你们想要他成为什么样的人，在这一点上是达成一致的。
