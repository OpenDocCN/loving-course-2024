# RSD德里克-游戏十诫：3 特维斯解读：游戏十诫 3.3 特维斯 第三节_ev

Commanment 3。Thou shalt open， like you mean it。By this point。

 you should have seen commandment 1 and have a clear view of the world around you。

And you should have completed the exercise and commandment， too。

 and have a clear sense of who you are， what you want to do with your life and who is the ideal companion for that life。

You'll notice a pattern that our main focus is on achieving clarity。

 reducing the uncertainty of the world around you so that you know exactly what to do。

So we will continue to do this as we redirect our intentions and transition from inner game to outer game。

By choosing to be trained by Drerick and myself， you are on team Drick now。

 And if you're going to be on this team， the way you open women belongs to us now。

 And we want to make that open strong and effective。I will keep this as simple as possible。Seag。

 approach girl。 That's it。Thus far， Ive discussed some very complex processes that will aid you as you go from beginner to advanced。

 But as someone who is a self described overthinker， I am telling you that out in the real world。

 you must keep things as simple as possible。These commandments are meant to stack upon one another。

 so the results of the work you achieve in Commandment 3 will reflect how deeply you considered commandments1 and2。

If you want to change an outcome， you have to change a behavior。To change your behavior。

 you have to change the thoughts in your head。 So for the rest of this commandment。

 I will take you from the work you have completed in commandments 1 and 2 to some thoughts and practices on opening。

We are not discussing opening like you mean it。 So we are making a shift from thinking to taking action。

 and it is important for you to know that all of the world belongs to the action takers。

The one thing that made Derek one of the sickest players that the game has ever seen was while every other dating coach was talking about theory。

 he was actually doing it and as a result， achieved a deeper understanding than any other coach。

You too will learn and improve far more quickly from taking action than you will from sitting around and thinking。

If all the best women and all the money went to the people who SAT around thinking all the time。

 then professors， philosophers and librarians would be multi billionionaires。Napoleon Bonaparte。

 the statesman and military leader that went on to rule most of Europe in the 1800s for over a decade。

 once said， take time to deliberate。But when the time for action has arrived。

 stop thinking and go in。Walt Disney， the most famous animator。

 film producer and entrepreneur of our generation， once said the way to get started is to quit talking and begin doing。

You， too， will have stories to tell， adventures to have and empires to build。

But you will not think your way to success， nor will information be your saviour。

 especially with success with women。Results come from taking action and taking action immediately。

 even before you have all the information and even before you feel like doing it。In fact。

 all of the theory and the information you have collected so far will most certainly be the raw information until it's backed up by testing it in the real world。

Even scientists know that they will have to test their hypotheses before proving their theories。

 no matter how legitimate they may seem。 Even entrepreneurs know they need to test their product on the market before they go into production。

 no matter how much they believe in their own product。

 All this means is that no matter what strategy you take， whether you jump in right away。

Or waste all the time to think or wait until you feel right。You are going to make a lot of mistakes。

Even if you think you're saying the right thing， it will still be the wrong thing until it's proven out。

Therefore， why try to say the right thing at all， especially when the girls expecting you to be real。

 not right。For this reason， I mentioned in commandment 1 that it is much better to be perfectly O with what you are already saying instead of hopelessly searching for the perfect thing to say。

Mistakes are going to be inevitable， and there's nothing you could do to avoid them。

But the good news is that they are the necessary precursors to achieving mastery。

Stoic philosopher Epictetus said thousands of years ago。If you wish to improve。

 be content to be thought foolish and stupid。😡，If you are not willing to be a fool and make mistakes。

 then you will not improve simple。I also mention in commandment1 how a change in your peer group will change your relationship to mistakes。

Studies show that people surrounded by poverty are taught to fear authority and not make mistakes。

People surrounded by wealth and abundance， however。

 are encouraged to make mistakes and have a positive relationship with it。

This is why we recommend that you change your peer group so， so much。

 But it is no accident that their wealth， income and even mastery are reflected by their positive relationships to making mistakes。

Poor people think， fear the authority。 Don't make a splash。 work harder， and you'll be fine。😰。

Rich people think， let's give this a try。 Mists are funny。I'll have to mess up before I get it right。

Now Ill still have to work harder。Pain plus reflection equals progress。

The difference between the novice and the master is that the master has failed more times than the novice has tried。

So before starting to take action， you must give yourself complete permission to fail and permission to make as many mistakes as you need to make。

If these mistakes are going to happen， which they will。

 then what is there the warrior complain about。It is something that is out of our control。

You will be rejected， embarrassed， shamed， social pressured on occasion kicked out， made fun of。

If you expect to take these actions to get what you want， what is there then to complain about。

In fact， it would be more productive to think about them less as mistakes rather than just collecting data points。

Consider yourself to be a social psychologist experimenter in his lab。Observant， engaged。

 maintaining emotional composure。Your lab is the world。

You don't need to care too much about the feedback。 If you need it to work， it won't。

You are simply looking at it as collecting data points for your model。

 which is simply understanding how to have sex with beautiful women。

We started with commandments 1 and 2 to set a foundation to build this model。For example。

 how do you react to a rejection？Oh， it's the wrong girl。 Of course， you responded this way。

 Add the data point to the model。How much action can you expect to take before you have a working understanding of this model。

The answer is about 4000 interactions。If that sounds like a lot， that's 20 women per night。

3 nights per week and five women per day for the other four days per week。 All this for one year。

For these first 4000， give yourself permission to make the mistakes and to learn。

Don't think about the number。 Just do the work and do your approaches。

The less you care about the outcome， the easier it is to go in and just check the box。

An alternative strategy for giving yourself permission to fail is to lower the threshold to success as much as you can so that you could start taking action immediately。

Think of it less as doing pickup and more of just being social。As a bare minimum to taking action。

 just say hi and then wish her well。 Hey， how's it going。 Hope you have a good day， why。

Because you're working on your social skills and you did something， if you avoid taking action。

 nothing else can happen。The strategy will be useful for the four days you go out and talk to five women per day。

Just say hi。 Wish them all。 Hope you have a good day。

Maybe feel a bit stupid about it or stupid about something else。 But you do it anyway。

 And you do the same thing to morrow and the next day and the next。 And with each day。

 your baseline of comparison gets a little higher， and that's magic。 That's compound interest。

 Do that for a year。 and your life will be completely different。😊。

Any time I personally got good at something， whether it was my music or my academics or my work。

 I didn't question doing the things to get there。 I knew that they worked。 so I just did them。

I didn't think I was supposed to get some result。 I did them just because I was supposed to。

I follow Derek's instructions the same way on boot camp， and I've never looked back。

This is a slow learning process， you'll have to be patient。

 therefore this overall concept cannot be understated， give yourself permission to fail。

Some girls will be open minded to you， and others won't fine。

 But give yourself permission to take as long as you need to mess up and then gain proficiency。Now。

 you may be wondering what you are literally supposed to say when you open another female。

If you are thinking about what you are supposed to say。

 you are violating commandment 1 and ignoring Comment 2。When game was taught many years ago。

 people were taught structured content， openers， scripts， routines， stacks。

Most people think that in order to get good， they must learn lots of pickup lines。

 prepare funny and interesting things to say and memorize loads of tactics。However。

 the results speak for themselves。 The guys with the most information finished last。

If you are thinking in that negative way， you are a victim of the rampant complication syndrome。

 which afflicts most guys in this game。 You don't need years of practice to get laid。 In fact。

 you don't need 4000 approaches before you can start getting laid。 Oftententimes。

 clients will get laid the first night they come on boot camp， despite very little experience。

Contrary to opinion， you don't have to learn 1000 different things。 Action is everything。

 Ta action is everything， Doing something， approaching the girl by saying something dumb even will get you started on this transformation。

To get women， unlike diffusing a nuclear bomb or say， hacking into the Pentagon。

 you need to employ just the right actions， not vast amounts of sophisticated manoeuvering。Remember。

 some women will like you no matter what， and others will not。

This game could be boiled down to the simple act of walking up to a girl and just starting the conversation。

 At times， it doesn't require more than five minutes before she starts showing interest。In fact。

 girls show interest in most guys after they start approaching really hardcore。 You'll see this， too。

The feeling that you need to have openers， scripts。

 routines or other tactics is a clear violation of commandment 1 because you are putting the value of the woman above yourself。

Remember that you are the most important person in the universe and you have all the content you could possibly talk about from commandment to。

As I've mentioned before。The blockage to enlightenment is attachment。

 So burn off this belief and lose the idea that you need to have routines， scripts。

 tactics or even opening lines。Why does the opening line need to matter so much。

Suppose I was a guest on a talk show as a dating consultant。 The first question they would ask is。

 what's your pick line。Is that the value I provide as a man， my pick line。

The rest of the world seems to think that there needs to be an excuse to start talking to someone。

 But I have come to learn that you don't need much of an excuse at all。

 You really can just go up and start talking。I'll give you a couple of frames， tools。

 and even some exercises later as training wheels。 but your ultimate goal is just to be able to see the girl。

 approach the girl and just start a conversation。So now you may be wondering that since you don't have any scripts。

 routines and tactics， and you should say exactly what you want to say。

 How can your brain seems to shut down when you go talk to the pretty woman。 Furthermore。

 how do you fix this。The brain processes reward chemicals like dopamine much differently when people are watching you do something as opposed to doing it by yourself。

Therefore， you'll end up behaving and making decisions as a function of how many people are watching you。

This is where a daily meditation， a fitness routine。

 and giving yourself permission to fail will help you keep a clear head。

When you see an attractive woman， your base assumption might be that you need to have something perfect to say。

As a result， the brain will filter out all the things that you think won't be good enough to say to her。

Unfortunately， that filter leaves you with exactly zero things to say。

 so the result is that you don't approach her or you remain tongue tied when you do。

What you must realize is that she is human， just like you。When your brain shuts down。

 your thought is oftentimes， I must say or do something funny， interesting to get her。This， again。

 is a violation of commandment 1。You don't need to say or do anything special。As Deerrek would say。

 you don't need to impress her， but rather impress upon her what type of man you are。

What does a girl think when she sees you doing this， trying to impress her。

It communicates to her that you don't deserve her。This why the assholes to type a guy that gets these girls because their dismissiveness broadcast at any moment they could just walk away from the girl。

This doesn't mean you should be a jerk， by the way。 If you're not a jerk， don't try to be。

 I've tried this。 So no need to walk down this road。 express value and be willing to walk away。

Simply say what you want to say when you go up to the girl。

 The price you pay if you need it to work is that it's not going to work and you'll end up saying nothing at all。

Oftentimes， you know what you will end up saying until you actually go up to the girl in the first place。

We'll talk about this later。Now that， you know， you can say what you want to say。

 you may be wondering how to deal with your approach anxiety。

We've talked about valuing things we can control and dismissing things we cannot control。

Emotions are something that happened to you， not consciously produced。

 If we could control them and make them go away， we probably would have already。

Approach anxiety is one of those emotions。It is something that occurs quite naturally in all men。

 And if you feel it， even quite strongly， understand that it simply means you are a healthy human being and not that there is something wrong with you。

The difference between the guys that get good at this and the guys that don't isn't the level of approachproach anxiety that they experience。

 But rather， what they choose to do with it。Consider a study done on callversion。

 which is phenomena no different than approach anxiety。

It is the anxiety someone feels before making a call to someone they don't know， in this case。

 to collect donations for a campaign。The researchers looked at two groups。

 people that had call version and chose to wait to collect more information before making the call and people that had call version as well。

 but picked up the phone anyways before they even felt ready。

Even though the first group had more information， they averaged about $40。

000 of donations by the end of the year。Where the second group that made the call anyways at the end of the year average over $200。

000 in donations。The 40，000 R group invested more time into thinking what to do instead of emotionally allowing themselves to just trust themselves。

The $200000 group didn't use information， but they used the very anxiety they felt to propel them forward。

 Ma that anxiety their greatest asset。The old aage says。

 although you can't get rid of the butterflies， you can get them to fly in formation。Personally。

 if I'm rusting or haven't been going out for a while。

 I will admit that I myself am scared every time I go to meet a new woman。

 I have no idea what's going to happen， and I can't seem to shake the anxiety off of me。 However。

 it is exactly the emotion I utilize to give me my edge。

 So I'll use that energy to help propel me forward by going for it anyways。Again， to conquer fear。

 you must become fear。 someone one who is strong and be the force that will protect in the time of danger when everyone else is frightened。

😰，Here is the ultimate solution to approach anxiety。one。Your brain needs proof， not promises。2。

 all feelings of anxiety stem from a fear of death。3， you will not die from talking to the girl。

4 when you talk to the girl， your lack of death will inspire you to talk to another。And five。

 repeat this and you will find that it is very easy to feel like going to talk to another girl。

The explanation for why this works probably warrants another hour of discussion。

 but I won't get into that。 What is important for you is that this is a very simple process that you can repeat every night forever。

 This is what can get you the entitlement that Sha talks about in his commentary。

 meaning the lack of emotion。Note by entitlement， we don't mean entitled to the result。

 but rather a lack of any major emotion when going to talk to women。 Don't forget。

 we are just talking to women。 We're not going to war。 We're not robbing a bank。

 We're not jumping out of an airplane。Compared to these things， this is nothing。

Take a moment to appreciate the things you already have and to consider what life would be like without them。

Everyone wants to feel better， but no one considers how good they have it already。

Even when we are all exhausted， Drek would tell me and the other team when you're 80 years old and can barely breathe。

 You will wish you felt this exhausted。 Also， don't forget you have a larger goal to accomplish。

 What is more important going on in your life。If the girl you are about to talk to is your biggest problem。

 then you need bigger goals。 There is a lot to remember from above。 And if you try to remember。

 you will lose out in the field。Furthermore， for every solution we provide。

 you will certainly find a way to invent another problem， as I've discovered on boot camp。

What do we do， There is a very， very simple solution to all these problems and any other potential issues regarding opening and starting a conversation。

 It is the one thing you need to remember when you are walking around and about to open another woman。

 and it is the very subject of this commandment。That one thing and that solution you need to remember is to open like you mean it。

What does this mean open like you mean it？When you walk into a group， you don't want to sneak in。

 You want to explode onto the scene， projecting your voice 10 per cent above the energy level of the environment。

 letting the words come out of your mouth， fueled by the enthusiasm of your approach。

 You want the fucking rock。😡，You want to make your presence known。 Let them feel you have arrived。

 You bring a tremendous amount of positive energy that will prepare you for the next 20 minutes。

 cuttingtting through all the nonsense internally and externally。😊，Then， you just glide。

The woman or women you are talking to will carry you on with their questions and implicit interest。

 Those 20 minutes will turn into 40 minutes and those 40 minutes into an hour。

Storming into a set as if possessed by Satan himself with lots of energy will carry you for a long time in that interaction。

Opening like you mean， it means that there is a symbolic firecracker in your ass。

 and it's about to go off and create a real fucking mess。

 And the only way to put it out is to fucking get in there and talk to that woman。😡，Done properly。

 short and shallow exchanges will be reduced to a minimum with lengthier and therefore deeper exchanges。

 you will get laid far more consistently。The actual words that you use to start conversations are。

 for the most part， irrelevant because you are going to jump straight into your own topics。

You can start with anything from hi。 My name is Travis to hey， what's up， follow by Gu。

 Check this out and then jump into anything you've been excited about as of recently。

Upon first impression， you might see this as slightly uncaibrated like you're expected to go into an interaction with your arms flailing and a wild energy。

 The energy level you give off must be about 10 per cent above the environment that you are currently in。

 not 50 per cent。This will differ from environment to environment， but overall。

 you are going to ultimately be noticed by the girl you are talking to and you are likely going to be noticed by other people。

Most guys out of fear of failure， go the opposite direction。

They try to sneak into the conversation by making the low key approach and testing the waters with weak body language。

 only to communicate to the group that they don't deserve to be there in the first place。

They find themselves swimming against the current from the get go。 And the animal kingdom。

 this is the common beta male mating strategy to be sneaky， approach softly， approachach from behind。

 risk nothing。 Don't stand out。A woman will see this and be disgusted。

 Under approaching an a tiid matter has0 value whatsoever。🤢。

Since these low value interactions lack momentum， they must keep forcing these conversations uphill。

Unable to get deep into interactions， those guys end up spam approaching with zero results。

You want to avoid such frustration。 You must aim to have longer exchanges if you expect sex to happen。

At the time of this recording through the 73 boot camps I've assisted。

 thousandshou of clients have seen and the thousands of approaches I've done myself。

 I've come to learn that people act like mirrors。This is known as the mirror neuron effect。

Simply defined as this。 Whatever you feel， she will also feel and vice versa。

People reflect everything you give them。You make your approach friendly。

 They will indulge you with their bonding。You behave in an angry manner。

 Then they will turn irritable。😡，If you come along with low energy， they seem to get down as well。

People will kick back whatever you choose to give them， and they return it multiplied tenfold。

 If you give them negativity， expect only the worst as a payback。On a closer look。

 they seem to copy your feelings， your approach and even your body language。This is not uncommon。

After you have been physical with a girl for a while， she starts to reciprocate by grabbing you back。

 not only her， but also her whole group， and they will give it back tenfold。

They seem to get into the energy you give them and multiply it by 10。 By the way。

 the opposite is also true。 If you give them negativity， you will get a thunderstorm back。

 So beware of what you give up。If people reflect your behavior back。

 then it makes sense you want to give them something positive to work with。

 You must find a reason to get excited and share your excitement with the other people。

 You will find it very hard to fake this。 You must make it true for you by sticking to what you have defined in commandment to。

Only you will know what makes you most excited in your life。Keep in mind， opening like you mean。

 it is not harsh。In fact， it is mostly relaxed， but you are doing it with an energy and a vitality。

 Moreover， I want you to project an easy， relaxed vibbe around people。

 No expectation of something in return。😊，Most guys approach with outcome dependence or desire to control others only to succeed at freaking people out。

You don't open like you mean it because you need it to work。

 You do it to start a conversation in the most effective way possible。Opening。

 like you mean it is a social practice， not a pickup tactic。

You will find it hard to relax around people if you run around the club with a pickup agenda in your head。

A negative attitude will self sabotage you out of your groups。

People will pick up on your weird vibe and they will run from you like the wind。

Staying easy going around others pays extreme dividends when you aim to stabilize an interaction。

Aim to relax people around you by behaving like you got nothing to lose。To do this。

 you must let go of validation seeking from girls。Opening like you mean。

 it doesn't mean strong armying the girl into talking to you。

 It means that you open like you are 100% committed to the interaction as an invitation for her to also be 100% committed。

Opening， like you mean it is how you dominate your own emotional state。

 If you were going into a boxing arena， what happens when you give only 98% of your effort instead of 100% of your effort。

I'll tell you what happens。 You lose， and you lose badly。

Opening like you mean it kills your approach anxiety because it hijacks that energy and uses the anxiety to create urgency and excitement。

 especially when you first get to the club， opening like you mean it will help you get over that initial resistance。

When you open like you mean it， you don't have to consciously think of the words that will come rushing to the surface from the initial energy of the interaction。

 why。The internal change in your own physiology from applying this energy will allow the conversation to carry forward。

All you have to do is let go and trust your brand to give you the right words。On this note。

 you can't create a new thought while holding one back。 Whatever the words are there。

 you have to trust them。😡，If you tried to remember anything you wrote down in commandment。

 too in your communication， you will certainly disrupt the flow of communication between you and the girl right in front of you。

Stay present。 You have to trust that it is there and let the momentum of the open bring that identity out of you。

More on this in commandment 5。When you open like you mean。

 it should feel like you're just riding a roller coaster when you're doing this and will help propel you get the necessary momentum in a particular interactions and the necessary momentum across the whole of the night。

I'm not going to give you some tools and exercises before going out so that you feel as prepared as you can before starting to go open like you mean it。

They are training wheels and you will use these until you no longer find that you need them。

Martial artist Bruce Lee， had once said。Like every one else， you want the way to win。

 but never to accept defeat to die is to be liberated from it。 So when to morrow comes。

 you must free your ambitious mind and learn the art of dying。

You will learn this art by taking some time to write down some default responses when talking to women in specific scenarios。

You might have written these down in commandment， too， in which case， you'll just copy them over。

If you don't have a set of default responses when you talk to women in specific scenarios。

 you will fall victim to those various scenarios when you become emotional and reactive to them。

 You will be under the thumb of circumstances， and circumstances will dictate how you feel and how you respond or live your life。

Many guys have no default reaction to a girl blowing them off or being rude to them。

They become reactive and a victim of circumstances。But you have a choice。In reality。

 you can create your very own default behavior to a situation like that from laughing your ass off to saying。

 you know， thank you for being a great sport。You can create those choices。

 you can have your agenda and enforce it。You can influence the situation rather than letting the situation influence you。

Your approach must be strong， so you must be able to handle what comes your way。

You will only be able to do as much as you are able to handle the worst case outcome。

Take time to consider these potential outcomes and write down your default responses to these situations。

Sit down。 and for 30 minutes， visualize some of these responses playing out。

Visualization is a powerful tool。This will help you play these default responses out in real life。

If you find yourself constantly surprised by the real world， then your model is wrong。

 and you will need to practice these visualizations after you have taken more action。

Here's another tool。 a default opener。Opening like you mean it means declaring your intentions from the beginning。

Most women will appreciate a man who can go up and say something honest。

 so that is where we will start。For now， your opener is this。 Hey， you're a pretty girl。

 I want to come say hi。 I'm Travis。 What's your name。Obviously， you'll say your name， not Travis。

I choose this because this is Derek's default opener and one that has proven to be most effective。

Say it out loud for yourself。 Hey， you're pretty girl。 I want to come say hi。 I'm Travis。

 What's your name。It's an incredibly useful tool since it gets her attention。

 lets her know why you are talking to her and offers some info。

 your name and then asks for hers in return。When you wait for her to reply。

 she'll either be curious and offer you her name to which she's interested to hear more or at least open minded。

Any other response other than her name， I'd encourage you to keep plying anyways。

 more on this in future commandments。 Otherwise have a default response for whatever she might say。

What you must understand is that only 7 to 10% of what is being communicated is the actual words themselves。

What the girl in front of you is looking for is eye contact， vocalinality。

 relaxed body language and a good energy。😊，As an exercise。

 say this default opener over and over for 10 minutes straight until you are comfortable with it。

Try it in a mirror。Try conveying different messages with the vocal toality in which you say it。

The best tonality is one of positive dominance。 Hey， you're pretty girl。 I want to come say hi。

 I'm Travis。 What's your name。Practice saying it like you mean it。When you first start going out。

 use this as your only opener until you can generally start conversations with it。

Remember to open like you mean it and not say it like a script。If you can't get this opener to work。

 then you might have some other problems you might need to have looked at。Keep in mind。

 you are saying this opener because you are a man who is going for what he wants and is looking to express value。

 You are not saying this as a defensive measure or to take value。 The girl will know which one。

Once you're comfortably opening conversations with this opener。

 you can start branching out to different openers。 In fact。

 most openers are just some variation of this one。What do you say after the opener。

Understand that the game is something that flows through you。Here's an exercise to explain this。

 This is something you could do before leaving your home。For 10 minutes， speak without stopping。

There are no other rules or restrictions than that。 Just speak without stopping for 10 minutes。

This is an exercise to practice speaking freely about whatever it is that you want。

If you take a moment to pause and think， start over。Say whatever is on top of your mind。

Say whatever it is that you are thinking and free associate into something else。

Bruce Lee had another saying。Challenge means one thing。And that is， what is your reaction to it。

 How does it get you。If you are secure within yourself， you would treat it very， very lightly。

If you say you do not have such doubt。And you do not have such fear。

You would certainly treat it very， very lightly。 just as to day， it will rain and to morrow。

 the sun will come along strong。This exercise will make you secure。

What this exercise does is give your brain proof， not promises that you are able to hold a conversation。

 because if you feel self sufficient that you could talk and talk and talk。

 even though it might sound like nonsense， you would be very comfortable going into a conversation about whatever you need to talk about。

Note。It is not necessary to do this exercise in front of the girl。

 She will likely think you are crazy。Just talk to her when you end up seeing her。

 you often see something you can observe about her or something she reminds you of。Finally。

 set goals for yourself that you know， you can strive for and achieve。

Goals that might be out of reach， but certainly are not out of sight。

Sometimes that means just going outside， or it means just being in the environment where there are other women。

Set achievable goals for yourself and resolve to always be doing better than what you were doing yesterday。

Always 1% better。Now， you are just about ready to start going out and talking to other women。

Here's an additional tool for some of your very first approaches。Remember。

 you must take action and give yourself permission to make mistakes and just look foolish doing so。

 Have fun with doing this。 Don't take it too seriously。

 It's a skill set you must build without your ego and take it all very， very lightly。😊，Also。

 you don't have to remember everything。 Just trust yourself and open like you mean it。

Walking up to women with such mental chaos makes you exude failure。

All that you need is that you believe you can do it。 You must believe that you are the shits。

 Remember that swagger。Redduce all other mental clutter。 Just keep this whole thing simple。

When you see the first girl， here is a process that you will remember。Step 1。

Resolve that you're going to talk to her， no matter what。2， don't give a fuck about your feelings。

 And since you're going in anyways， you might as well be in the best mood that you can muster。😡，3。

Give yourself permission to fail。And four open like you mean it。

This is a process I'll use on boot camp when I haven't warmed up yet。

 Or if I need to do a demo when I've been coaching for most of the night。 I'll look at the girl。

 and I know 100%， I'm going to talk to her。I accept my reality and don't give a fuck about my emotions。

That being said， I'll put myself in the best mood I could be in and give myself complete permission to mess up。

Then I'll very harshly push myself in and then open with a strong enthusiasm。So put more simply。1。

 I will talk to her。2， fuck my feelings。😡，3 onmni ship4， no pressure。Five， open strong。

I will talk to her。 F my feelings。 I'm the shit。 No pressure。 Open strong。😡。

I've run through the cycle enough times that instead of going through these steps。

 it just comes up as fine。When you arrive to the open， relax completely。Hey， you're a pretty girl。

 I'm Travis。 What's your name。Now， the million dollar question。

 what do you say after you delivered your opener。Instead of thinking what to say。

 simply allow your mouth to move and the words to just come out。This is a focus on relaxation。

 a focus on giving yourself permission to fail， a focus on not needing it to work。

 A focus on accepting no false gods before you。Just look at her and wait for the words to come out。

You'll figure this out when you get there。This is an opportunity to inject personality immediately。

Avoid the temptation to start asking a bunch of questions， Make statements， observations， beliefs。

 what you are feeling， what you are thinking。 Let her know what is on your mind。

Have fun with it and delight yourself with what comes out。Allow the mo to move。

 the more filters you could turn off， the better。If you did commandment too correctly。

 executing this commandment will unlock your answers in real time。 It is important to be honest。

 right away。By turning those nasty people pleasing filters off， you arrive at a new freedom。🤢。

A freedom to express yourself without holding back must rule your actions。

Say whatever you feel like saying without caring about the consequences。

Give your honest opinion on things without dreading some pushback。In fact。

 nobody will know about it the next day。Last but not least here's a macro strategy for when you first enter into the club。

Start talking to girls right away。It doesn't matter so much what you say。

 What matters more is that you do it and that you do it like you mean it。

You can only say so much to the first few girls， since your brain will not be primed to be in a social mood yet。

You were there the chat not to get something。Regardless， open like you mean it。 convey interests。

 likes and dislikes。 Spak freely of what is actually on your mind。

 If you can't think of anything to say， say， I can't think of anything to say。

One of my first ever closes I had on boot camp。 I opened with， I'm a usually very charismatic man。

But I can't think of anything to say， but I wanted to come say hi。

We were making out within the first minute。I once went up to a girl in the Las Vegas nightclub。

 And when I got to her， no words were coming out。I thought to myself， oh shit。

All that managed to bubble up was I'm here。 You're there。 There are lights over there。 and yes。

I pulled that girl， later on。Trust the words。 Trust your instincts。

When you have finished talking to the first girl， it is important that you quickly find another。

You'll find that you will let go more and more with each new girl。

You will get over the rejection aspect by encountering it continually and continually over the course of the night。

Furthermore， give yourself positive affirmations throughout the night。

 Find something funnier about each interaction。😊，This will be hard to do it first。

 but make it a habit by consciously trying。 This is a muscle you will have to build。

Keep it as simple as that。 Start talking to girls immediately， Open like you mean it。

 minimize time between your interactions and give yourself positive affirmations。

It is at this point I can comfortably say you have all the tools you need to start going out and getting results。

If you are confused and still don't know what to say。

 force yourself to start talking to the girls right away and open strongly anyways。

Similar could be said that a guy that waits until he is ready versus a guy that approaches right away is the difference between 5 and 56 partners in a single year。

 So start immediately。Emotion will be created through action。You will not think your way out of this。

 You will never think your way out of this。 So just fucking， go。😡。

Have that urgency and open like you mean it。So before we get started。Answer this for yourself。

How quickly do you want to get through your first  four thousand00 data points。One year， 10 years。

 20。Do this now。 The time is ticking。Resolve to show up to your own success every day。

 at the very least。Never give up。Get in there。Start where you are and accept that reality。

 Give yourself permission to feel whatever you have to feel and make as many mistakes as you need to。

Make the night about having fun。Don't take this too seriously。

 Have that carefree attitude that other people would love to be a part of。For now。

 don't worry about the result。 Just do good approaches。Don't worry about the results。

 They will find you。Although you're having fun， it's going to be a tough process。

 growthrowth is not a fun process。 It's going to hurt， but it should not break you。

 set goals for yourself， set achievable goals for yourself， and build on them。Remember the process。1。

 I will talk to her 2， F my feelings，3， I'm the shit，4， no pressure，5 open like you mean it。😡。

I leave you with a quote from one of the greatest painters of all time。

 Vincent Van Gogh and his relationship to getting started。😊，He said。I tell you。

If one wants to be active， one mustn't be afraid to do something wrong sometimes not afraid to lapse into some mistakes。

To be good。Many people think they'll achieve it by doing no harm。And that's a lie。

That leads to stagnation， to mediocrity。Just slap something on it when you see a blank canvas staring at you with a sort of imbecility。

You don't know how paralyzed it is。 that stare from a blank canvas that says to the painter。

 you can't do anything。 The canvas has an idiotic stare that mesmerizes some painters so that they turn into the idiots themselves。

Many painters are afraid of the blank canvas， but the blank canvas is afraid of the truly passionate painter who dares and who has once broken the spell of you can't。

Life itself， likewise， always turns towards one infinitely meaningless， discouraging。

 dispiriting blank side on which there is nothing any more than on a blank canvas。But however。

 meaningless in vain， however， dead life appears the man of faith， of energy。

 of warmth and who knows something doesn't let himself be fobbed off like that。

He steps in and does something and hangs on to that。 In short， he breaks。 He violates， they say。

The world is waiting。 So jump in。 Get started to day。It does not have to be perfect。

 but you do have to open like you mean it。
