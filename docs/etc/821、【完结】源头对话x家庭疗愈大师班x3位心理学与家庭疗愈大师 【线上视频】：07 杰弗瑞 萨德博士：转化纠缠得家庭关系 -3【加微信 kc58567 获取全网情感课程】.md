 do we have it。好。Do I have one any more time？我们还有多的时间吗？Yes， j， we have half hour about， okay。

I wanted to share my screen。好，我想分享一下我的屏幕。And I wanted to make a couple of brief points。

我想要简短的来说明几个关键点。Can you see my screen now。嗯哼， yeah。😊，Okay， so as I said， therapy started with Freud。所。

就像我刚刚提到的心理治疗始于弗洛伊德。And when Europe was destroyed after World War I。当二战毁掉了欧洲之后。

And there was a society that was conducive。当时有一个非常有建设性的社群。

 therapy developed from an individual basis。心理治疗起步的时候是集中于个体的视角。 and it was really in the 1960s。

真的是到了1960年代的时候， therapy developed。家庭治疗被发展了出来。 There are many different schools of therapy。

当时存在很多不同的治疗学派， and none of them is right。而且并没有某一个是唯一正确的。

 all of them have the potential to be effective。每一个学派都有有效的潜力。Now， this diagram is a car。中间那个图是一辆车。

The front wheels are thinking and behavior。前面的两个车轮是思维行为。The back wheels are emotion and physiology。

后面的两个车轮是情绪情感以及生理基础。 but the car works in a context。这辆车呢是开在一个情境当中的。

 if you change the thinking or the behavior。如果你把思维和行为换掉， both of which are conscious。

这两个都是有意识层面的 that may change the direction of the car。那么我们就会换改换这个车行进的方向。

 If you change the physiology by giving medicine。如果你通过服用药物来改变生理基础。

 that may change the function of the car。这可能会改变这个车的功能。If you change the state。如果你改变状态。

 that may change the function。这也可能改变功能 but the front wheels are more conscious。

前轮更是意识层面的 The back wheels are more unconscious。后轮更偏向于潜意识的层面。But if you change the context。

但是如果你把情境改变掉， which is a systemic perspective。情仅指的就是一个系统性的视角， the way the car works。也会改变这辆车行进的方式。Now。

 systemic effects do not live in the world of。A cause and effect。那，系统性的效果呢是不存在于一个因与果的逻辑世界中的。

 This is an example in nature。In biology。举一个生物学上大自然的例子， These are four heart cells。这四个是心脏的细胞。

And if you put them in a solution。如果你把这些细胞浸入到某一种溶液当中。Nopes。8。Well that's not working very well。Okay。

 the heart spell it's coming。We'll start to beat together。They will coordinate。心脏细胞会渐渐的开始协调。

然后以同样的节奏速度来跳动。 systemic effect。这就是一个系统性的效果。The same thing happens with fireflies。蜻蜓也会发生同样的情况。

They start萤火虫萤火虫也会开始渐渐的以同样的节奏速度。闪光。It's a systemic effect。🎼这是一个系统性的效果。 same thing happens with birds。

🎼天空中的鸟群也是一样的， and the same thing happens with fish。🎼鱼群也是一样的。🎼，There's no leadership。在这些群体当中。

不存在某一个领导 systemic effect。而是系统带来的效果。The same thing happens in physics。在物理学当中也会发生同样的事情。Okay。Yeah。Yeah。

Yeah。They coordinate。他们会渐渐的协调同步。あから。お。No。The same thing happens with people。人也会发生同样的情况。

This is a systemic effect。这是一个系统性的效果。And we can make some assumptions。我们可以做出一些假设。That。

One of the assumptions is that people need to be understood inside their relationship。

其中一个假设就是需要把人放到他的人际关系当中去理解。 There is no right way to be in relationship。并不存在某个单一的存在于人际关系当中的所谓正确方式。

 As Chloe said， there are many different cultural and multi generational influences and loyalties。

就像刚刚可以说的，存在着很多来自文化的、来自代际之间的因素影响因素。 the main problem with couples。夫妻之间主要的问题 is conversion。是如何改换忠诚的对象？

 I try to convince you of my perspective。我试着想要用我的观点立一场来说 to convince me of your perspective。你也想要说服我。

Nothing happens。这样的话什么都发生不了。But this is the most common problem。然然这确实是最常见的问题。

 and these are due to personality differences。这些源自于个性的不同。

 and there's always going to be regrettable incidents。于是呢总会发生一些让人遗憾的事情。

The main problem is how to repair quickly。主要的关键在于如何快速的修复。 when we're in the world of systems。

当我们身处于系统的世界， are not in the world of cause and effect。我们并不是处处于起因和结果线性对应的世界。

And marriage makes a relationship compulsory。当存在婚姻的时候，婚姻让关系变成了一种必然的存在。

 in itself creates interesting problems，于是他本身就会带来一些很有意思的问题。That's a big topic to address。

这是一个有待讨论的很大的话题。Now， principles for intervention。那用来干预的原则。Is who has the most anxiety。在于去辨认谁的焦虑感变最大。

 who has the less anxiety。谁最不焦虑？My， my philosophy。What the哲 is like a doctor doing a physical examination。

有点像是一个做身体检查的医生。 This area is sensitive。我说你这个部位很敏感， from the outside。我从外面开始暗起。

Start with the person who has the least anxiety。先从系统当中最不焦虑的那个人开始。Try to disperse the concern。

试着去分散一下担心 so that it's not just in one individual。于是呢就不会只集中在一个人身上， shared by the family。而是可以由家人共同去承担。

Find a way to address strengths。找到一种方式去讨论力量优势。And define goals that are achievable。去定义出那些可实现的目标。

 understand that there's an identified patient。理解系统当中存在一个被指定为病人的人。

 and that is clearly indicated that has a systemic function。就好像刚刚Cloe也指出，被在系统当中指认一位病人是有一个系统性的功能的。

And we need to understand relationship patterns。而且我们得要能够理解关系中的模式。And social roles。理解社会角色。

Can you identify a social role。你能辨认出某一个社会角色吗？It's very customary。That in a family structure。

 someone will over function。因为很典型的情况是，在家庭的结构当中，往往会有一个人过渡功能。有些人呢功能不足。These are social roles。那些全都是社会角色。

It's valuable to make some comments on the quality of relationships。对关系的质量做一些评论是很有价值的。

 not only internal to the family， but also in relationship to the therapist。不仅是去评论家人之间关系的质量。

也去评论和治疗师之间的关系的质量。 and one thing that I could not do。有一件我不能做的事情。I prefer to talk with people。

Using their name。就是我更喜欢直呼对方的姓名来跟对方交流 up their function。而不是去跟他的功能交流。

So if I could have used the three names。所以如果我能够使用那三个字的名字， be better than talking about husband。

 wife and son。嗯，三个人的名字，那会比我说呃先生、妻子、儿子、丈夫这样的功能的称呼会更好 their functions。因为那些称呼指指向的是他们的功能。

When there's an opportunity， have family members talk directly to each other。在适当的时机邀请家人之间彼此直接的交流。

And an important。Idea is to reflect on hierarchical differences。还有一个很重要的也很有帮助的理念，是协助他们去反思不同等级之间的差异。

There was balance。有什么样的平衡？The mother was more involved。妈妈投入程度更高。His mother。因为他是妈妈。

But father was involved too。嗯爸爸也很投入的， and I couldn't determine that there was a unusual a lack of balance in the strength of the mother and father。

我并没有辨认出爸爸和妈妈之间的力量强度上有某种失衡。And we were talking about developmental differences。我们之前也谈到发展性的差异。

I was as a young man， developed very late。我年轻的时候成熟的很晚。I didn't go into puberty until I was 18。

That fits a statistical pattern。也是啊。也是很符合统计学上的模式的。没有。There are some books about my approach。

有一些书当中说明了我采用的方法 and a workshop next week。下周也会有一个工作坊。My approach is more experiential。

我采用的方法更是体验性的方法 based in hypnosis。以催眠为基础， but not necessarily using hypnosis。

但是不见得会直接使用催眠 Hypnosis is a model of how to be experiential。催年是其中一个把工作做成体验性的工作的方式。

 and I'm always grateful to Mike and to Grace for organizing my programs。而且我也始终非常的感谢迈克grace为我主办课程。

This is a series that will continue。这是一个我们会持续开展的系列课程。We start in May， and we continue in October。

从5月份开始，然后在10月份继续。So those are general comments。所以刚才呢就是一些一般性的评论。Thinking systemically。系统性的思考。

Princiipples that are not logical。这些原则都不是逻辑性的原则， but they govern the way in which systems operate。

但是这些原则统率着系统运作的方式， This is not a necessity for being a good coach。而这也不见得是要成为一个好的教练不可或缺的东西。

 but it is something that intrigues me。但他确实引发了我的兴趣。

 So I work at developing my understanding of systems。所以我也在努力的持续发展我对系统的理解。

 So if we have a little time。如果我们还有多一点时间， I'm glad to answer questions。我很乐意回答一些问题。Yes。

 maybe one to two questions。Yeah。Thank you。And thank you， Mike。Thank you。OK嗯，让信来我看到嗯对我看到同学们打开视频，并且举手。

那我邀请704钉子。So let me invite one of the participants，704。 Thank you。Hello。啊，你好。嗯，那那我现在是可以提问题是吗？

 shall来 ask my question。可以啊，那那我想问一下，就是嗯就是说我我对自己的认定是一个比较也是比较高敏感，比较特殊的一个人。呃，就是我也渴望一个良好的人际关系。但是因为种种的原原因。

我我和家人，还有朋友也比较少，就是。我老是觉得就是我跟心理学的老师在一起交流，或者听你们说话，我是感觉是能理解的。或者说在一个呃比较相像的维度吧。然后我和我自己身边现实生活中周围的人。

我觉得他们是理解不了我的呃，可能受限于他们的这个呃教育经历这个年代等等的因素。那那我我就想知道我我我我应该怎么样去让自己拥有一些比较良好的，能够互相理解的这样这种人际关系。因为因为我父母就是对我来说。

实在是他们年纪和我差异的比较大。然后思维比较固执。我我这个就就不知道该怎么和他们去和你们这样比较和谐的一起对话。就是我老觉得他们理解不调我，他们他们他们也觉得我理理解不了他们。

I am a very sensitive and special person， and I long for good relationships。 For some reason。

 I don't hang out well with my friends or my family。

 But when I talk or listen to psychology teachers like you guys， I feel very understood。

 and I can understand you。 But people in my real life， they don't really get me。

 maybe because of various reasons， different psychological backgrounds， educational background。

 different generation。So I would really like to ask you。

 how can I have better relationships with my parents， with my real life people in my life。

 because my parents are much older than me。 We have very big age differences。

 and they're very stubborn。 they're much older。 so it's really difficult for me to have harmonious communication with them。

 we don't get to each other。Yes。I was working sub I was working secretly。我在秘密的工作着。

To see if I could get you to smile。嗯，来看我能不能让你微笑。Finally， at the very end of your question。

 you smiled。😊，最终在你提问提到尾声的时候，你微笑起来了。Throughout your question， I was smiling at you。😊，在整个你提问的过程当中。

我都在朝你微笑 with the hope that I could get you to smile back at me心中希望着你也可以回给我一些微笑。

 but you are so intent on asking your question。然而你的注意力非常的集中在你提的问题上面。

 you didn't see that I was smiling。那一开始你并没有看到我在笑。You are so focused。你非常的集中聚焦。对。You miss my cue。

错过了我的信号。 But finally， at the end， you smiled。😊，但是最终结束的时候，你笑了。Now， there is probably a book in China。

很可能在中国能买到这本书。I'm a highly sensitive person。叫做高敏感人士。If there isn't a book。如果没有这本书。

 then this is a task for you。那么要把这个任务交给你。I want you to write the book in Chinese about being a highly sensitive person。

 and someone needs to be the expert in China。得要有这样一个在中国的这方面的专家。

 I know who an expert is in the United States。我知道在美国谁是这方面的专家。

But I don't know who the expert is in China。但我不了解在中国学习这方面的专家， and it can be you。有可能就是你。

And this can be an interesting area of exploration。而且这会是一个很有意思的可可以去探索的领域。 a lot of other people。

你知道你可以帮到很多其他的人， because you're one of millions。因为你是那数百万人中的一员。Now， the principle is。

原则是 if you have a lemon， make lemonade。如果你有一颗柠檬呢，做一杯柠檬汁，柠檬茶。What is the virtue of a perceived fault？

一个被视为是过错的这个错误，他的美善，他的美德在哪呢？ And when you write the book on highly sensitive people。

当你去写这本有关高敏感人群的书的时候， that it gets published in English。我也希望那本书能够被翻译成英文出版，I can learn from you。

这样我就能够向你学习了。The best thing to do is to teach what it is that you want to learn。最好的做法就是去教你想要学的东西。Yeah。

So who else One more question嗯还有谁啊可以再再问一个。啊，是啊。嗯，好的，谢谢啊，非常感恩哈，我有这个我有这个机会，非常感恩嗯。😊。

Thank you for the opportunity。嗯。想起来会有一些沉重。It might be a little heavy to talk about。嗯。

我在想就是 be a little brief。而且得要简短一点。Okay。叫H嗯，本来是比如说聚焦在孩子的问题上，但是孩子他只是我们家庭中的那个症状表现。那么实际上我自己的探索呢。嗯。

是我跟我先生的关系这个上面。Before the focus was on a child's problem。

 but then we realized it's just one manifestation of the real problem and the real problem I discovered is with me and my husband。

 our relationship。是。嗯，我在回顾我们结婚30多年。然后经常是他去到一个城市，然后我移过去几年以后，他又。看上去是因为生活生机，他要去到另外一个城市，我再移过去。我算了一下。

已经有4次这样。现在我们仍然是他在另外一个城市。我在一个城市带着孩子。We've been married for over 30 years and I noticed the pattern is that he would move for work or some reason to another city then I would follow him to that city and live there and seems that the reason is he needs to make a living so I would tack along and we have moved for four times but still now the situation is he's working elsewhere and I'm with my child our child staying in another city。

Oh。Fed。Wai I'm asking you wait because your tears are more important than your words。我之所以请你稍等。

是因为你的眼泪比你要说的话更加的重要。は。Your tears have a message for you。你的眼泪有一些想要传达给你的讯息， tears are a communication。

你的眼泪是一种沟通。嗯确实。Here is as far as I can bend。我的手这样弯，只能弯到这个角度， I can bend here。可以弯到这里。

But I can't bend any further。但没有办法再继续玩了。This is where I'm comfortable。这个角度是我舒服的。

 this is what I can do。这个也是我能做到的，that's as far as I can go，但我也只能做到这里了。

You have some hard things to think about。你有一些很困难的需要去思考的东西， you have some heavy things to think about。

你有一些很沉重的需要去思考的东西。I think it would be very difficult for you to do that alone。而且我认为你要独自去思考那些会非常的难。

 when you have somebody who you can talk to。但是当有一个你可以交流的人。

 you'll be better able to understand your own thinking and feeling。你会能够更好的去理解你自己是怎么想的，有一些什么感受。

I'm sure that Mike can help you find someone to talk to。而且我敢肯定市民可以帮你找到一个陪你一起聊一聊的人。

But trying to solve everything inside your own mind。Is probably going to be less effective。

当你试图所有的一切都放在自己的心里，脑海当中去独自解决，很可能效率不会那么好。To have a trained listener。你只需要一个受过训练的倾听者。Who can help you to。

Sort out your own thinking。他可以帮你去梳理你自己的思考。To find out how much you can do this。来帮助你去了解这样的角度，你可以弯折多久。

You've been a very dutiful wife。你经历了很美丽的一生。You've been very accommodating。一直以来都非常的适应。Up to a point。

但会到某一刻到某个时候。And your tears seem to say that you need to think about things。In a very direct way。

而且似乎你的眼泪正在告诉你，你是这样一种很直接的方式来想一想， you can't keep doing this anymore。已经不能再继续这样下去了。We had to stop。
