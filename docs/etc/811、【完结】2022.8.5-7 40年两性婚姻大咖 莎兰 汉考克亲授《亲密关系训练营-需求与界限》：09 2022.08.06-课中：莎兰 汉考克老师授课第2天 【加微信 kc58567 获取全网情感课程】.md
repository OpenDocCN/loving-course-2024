Your make。嗯。No， yes。Wonderful， okay。Okay， fantastic。Nhao everyone， oh， everybody looks so good。😊，P。对。

Can you hear me， Alice， yes， yes。Wonderful。So my translatorators there， hi。Hi s， hi everyone。

 so I would like to begin。With a short meditation just to bring you into。

A place where you are grounded and solid in yourselves， and I will explain why we do this。那么在开始的时候呢。

我们先来一个非常短暂的静心冥想，让大家能够扎根安注于内在。我现在跟大家解释一下为什么要做这个进心。Yes we talked about boundaries。

 so I would like to give you an example of a good boundary and what also is not such a good boundary。

昨天我们聊到了界限，今天我会给大家一些例子去讲一讲好的界限和坏的界限。So yesterday we talked about emotions。

And there has to be boundaries around our emotions。那昨天我们也聊到了情感和情绪。那我们说到这点呢，一定要在情感和情绪的周围建立好良好的界限才行。

A good boundary is that you can hold your own emotions without spilling over。

良好的界限意味着你能够非常中正的保持着自己的情绪，而不至于把它向外溢向外撒。See， sometimes when we're so emotional。

 there's no boundaries around it。 It has no container。很多时候当我们情绪化的时候呢。

周围是没有一个非常良好的界限以及容器的Now when we're a child， it's understandable because children don't have boundaries around their emotions。

当我们还是个孩子的时候，这样的情况是可以理解的。因为孩子在自己的情绪周围没有办法建立良好的界限。But part of being an adult is that you feel your emotions。

 but in a way that has a container，但作一个成年人，就意味着我们能够感受到自己的情绪，同时又能够有一个容器在保持着他。

Then boundaries are something very beautiful and emotions are。😊，Make us even more attractive。

那界限实际上是非常美好的事情，而这种充满着情感和情绪的状态，会让我们的状态会让我们自己啊变得更加的有吸引力。

So when our emotions spill over and we can't contain them， if you're in a relationship。

 that's very difficult for your partner。那当我们在情绪化的时候，没有办法去有一个界限来像容器一样的保持住的话。

对于你的伴侣来说是非常艰难的Now all of us know even I sometimes have really trouble when I get very emotional。

 And then I have to think， wait a minute。 That's the child。

 Let me see how I can put a good boundary around my own emotions。我们每个人都会遇到这样的情况，包括我自己很多时候当我在情绪化的时候。

我都会想稍等一下，这个是我内在的孩童的感受，让我给他包裹住一个非常安全的界限和容器。Now， the opposite of this is people who can't feel anything whose emotions are really suppressed and who are what we would say blocked。

 cut off。那么还有一个我们知道的与之相反的情况，就是感受不到任何情绪的人。我们会说这样的人他是卡住的，他是身心分离的。Thank you。 That's the other extreme。

 We would call that people who are emotionally walled off。 their emotions are behind a thick wall。

那么这另一个极端呢，我们把它叫做是情绪被一堵啊，后墙给挡住了，隔离住了。So people are asking me how should we look at our boundaries so the first boundary that we're going to do today is the boundary around your emotions so you're not cut off but you're not spilling over everywhere。

那么人们会问我啊，我们如何建立自己的界限呢？我的回答就是，首先我们要围绕着自己的情绪来建立界限。在这样的平衡的情况下，我们并没有失去跟情绪的连接，但是也不会让情绪向外撒向外移。

So I want to give you something very， very beautiful today in our meditation。

 they are three ways that you hold your hands so that that supports you to find a good beautiful boundary for your feelings。

 energy and emotions。那么今天在进行当中啊，我会教给大家三个非常美好的方法，用这样的三个双手连接的方法来保持自己的生命能量、情绪和感受。And these exercises。

 you can do them by yourself。At home， on the subway， any time you need them， they calm you down。

 they give you grounding， they put you in a good space。那进行练习呢，我们可以在家里面坐，在地铁上坐，随时随地都可以坐。

它能够让我们进入到一个非常平静的能量状态。 So first of all， I would like to show them to you。

 Then we're going to put on music， and I will guide you through a process of using these hand positions。

 This is the first one。 your fingertips lightly touching see。那这是 triangle我们的第一个动作像是一个三角形。

非常轻柔的食指的指尖相触。 and then you take your hands in this triangle and you put them in your lap。

然后带着这样的一个手型啊，放在你的腿上。And what these exercises do is they relax the right side and the left side of your brain so you really calm down个练能够同时放松你的左右脑让你进入到一个平静的状态里angle with your hands and in your lap so this youre relaxed in your shoulders。

这样的一个十指相触的手型，三角形放到大腿上，肩膀放松向下沉。And when you do that， you're going to breathe very slowly like this。

非常缓慢的呼吸。像这样。Okay that we did yesterday， so that's our first position our second position watch is you hold up your right hand and you take these three fingers and you put them on this part of your right hand。

 you see。那么这个呼吸昨天已经学过了啊，Here。首先呢我们让左手啊伸出中间的三根手指，然后放到右手的这个部位。

right hand left hand on right hand and you hold your hands左手放到右手上，然后这样放到大腿上一样的。

And it's very beautiful， it lets you connect to your heart and to your tanier they balance your heart and your belly。

这是一个非常美好的姿势它能够去平衡你的心灵和丹田。It's really good then we change it。

 you hold your left hand you take your right hand you do the same thing on the other side so we balance the two sides now然后我们再做相反的一测啊现在是右手放在左手上右手的三根手指放在左手上 and what happens is you balance yin and yang it's really nice it's very it's like how you give to yourself it's a way that you give love and attention to yourself。

那，通过这样的切换呢，我们就能够去平衡自己的阴阳，这是我们能够回馈自己，照料自己，关注自己和爱自己的时刻。OK， so let's do it together。

 I will guide you through the three stages。O， please can someone give me that lovely music。

I just wanted to say two things before I start my teaching for today。那今天在开始教导之前，我想说两点。

That I received some questions that some of you asked to your small groups。那我收到了大家发过来的一些问题。

And I thought your questions were really wonderful so after the teaching I want to try and answer at least 15 questions我觉得大家的问题非常的好所以在我们讲完课呢我想要至少回答15个左右的问题 and I want to thank you because I think your questions reflect really deep intelligence that you really understand what we're talking about here。

我想感受感谢大家的问题呀，因为大家的问题能够反映出你们的理解力非常的有深度。大家能够呃领悟到我所讲的内容是什么？Okay， so first of all。

 before I go on to talking about needs because our subject today is needs yesterday was boundaries today is needs and tomorrow we put it all together那昨天我们的主题是界限今天呢是需求明天两者将放在一起讲。

I want to clarify something I said yesterday because I don't want to confuse you and what I said about the affairs yesterday。

 I want to make it clear today那么在正式的进入讲课之前呢，我想澄清几点不想让大家误解关于外遇的部分。

So it wasn't completely right what I said yesterday so I apologize if I was unclear so let me try and be clear today昨天并没有说的完全清楚如果昨天造成了一些误会。

我在这里向大家真诚的道歉那今天呢我想更加清晰完整的再讲解一下这点。There are two aspects when people have affairs。当人们有外遇的时候，有两个方面。

And the first aspect is if you feel that you don't get the love where you are and you feel attracted to someone else。

 that's understandable that you would want to experience a happy situation where you could feel happiness and love that's absolutely clear。

第一个方面啊，也就是第一个情况是在你当下的关系当中，你感受不到爱。同时呢你遇到了一个让你感受到爱和连接的人。在这个时候。

你特别希望能够在与他的关系和连接当中去感受这一份爱 and it's totally natural that we would want to feel loved and alive and excited about life and positive that's totally understandable在这一点是非常自然。

也是可以被理解的。我们想要感受到自己的活力感受到自己的生命力兴奋以及这种爱。 However， in general， an affair usually means something secret。

 something hidden。然而，外遇它总是意味着某一些东西是秘密进行的，它是呃隐藏起来的。And when things are hidden and there's dishonesty and secrets and lies。

 this can be very hurtful to people。当有一些东西它是隐藏秘密，具有欺骗性的时候呢，他就自然而然的会伤害到某一些人。So in general。

When we talk about growing and healing， we try to encourage people to be honest and not hide and tell lies and。

Betray people that that's really never good。而当我们说到成长和疗愈的时候，他就一定是在坦荡和诚实的情况下进行的。他并不是一个欺骗的谎言。

And you know， it's very difficult with affairs because we generally are afraid that somebody will be hurt or somebody will be angry。

 so we don't talk about it， but when we don't talk about things and we tell lies。

 it hurts other people， it crosses their boundaries， they feel betrayed， they feel unsafe。那一般来说。

当外遇是在这样的一个隐秘的具要欺欺骗的情况下进行的时候，我们就不愿意去探讨他，不愿意去谈论他，那么他就成为了一个谎言。这样的谎言会给其他人带来非常大的伤害。

这就跨越了一个界限给别人造成非常大的情感上的伤害。 So what I was trying to say yesterday。

 if you in a marriage where there's no love， there's no connection and something comes into your life and you want to follow that。

 then it's really important to talk to the person that either you're married to or living with and tell them。

 honestly， this is what's happening， This is what I feel， how should we do this。

 how can we manage this。 Now I know that sounds very difficult。

 but it is the only way that we don't hurt each other。那昨天我跟当我告诉大家，当你在一个没有爱的关系当中，遇见了一个跟你有连接的人。呃。

我指的是当你在这样的情况下，你需要非常真诚的告诉自己现在的伴侣，探讨一下现在的情况是怎样，我们该如何面对如何处理，如何践行。我知道这非常听起来非常的困难。但是这是唯一的一种坦诚的方式，不伤害他人的方式。

Because you know I didn't want to give you the idea that oh it's okay just go out and have an affair。

 no that's not correct it's being responsible for yourself。

 taking responsibility for your needs and respecting all the different people involved。我不想给大家留下一种印象。

就是说遇到外遇了就去吧，什么都不管了。我想说的是，在这样的情况下，我们需要全然的为自己负起责任，并且能够顾及到自己当下生活当中的方方面面。So I hope that's clear。

 Is that clear， I think so。那我希望呢现在的解释让大家能够更加的清晰，你觉得更加清楚了吗？So this brings us to another point。

 which is。When we want real intimacy， the foundation of intimacy is authenticity。

那这个话题呢就把我们带到了亲密这个话题上，亲密的基础就是真实。Is showing yourself。

 is saying things that come from deep inside you and being visible， showing yourself to people。

也就是当你展现自己的方式，或者与别人沟通的方式，都全然的来自于你最真实的生命的底层，或者你心灵的底层。Now， this is very difficult。

 I just need to close my window one second。稍等一下，老师关一下窗子。嗯。嗯。

This is very difficult because mostly how we were brought up。

Did not really encourage ourselves to be authentic。呃，这是非常困难的。因为我们被养育的过程当中呢。

并没有被鼓励说自己要呃变得真实或者真实的去与别人相处。When we were young we had to adapt。

 that was our style to survive in our families， all of us did it。

 no matter where you come from in the world， we all did it。当我们还是一个孩子的时候，我们就需要去适应外在的环境。无论你在世界上的哪一个角落。

这都是我们会不得不去做的一件事情。And I'm saying this because it's going to move into the talk about our needs so children look at their families。

 they learn to look at what is mother feeling， what is father feeling and what is it that I need to be so that I feel loved or I feel that I belong in this family system。

我这样说的原因啊，是因为当我们还是个孩子的时候，我们会在家庭当中去观察母亲的感受，父亲的感受，然后再去想我要以怎样的状态在这个家庭当中存在。

It's natural children are very dependent， they're very vulnerable。

 we learn to adapt by seeing how the family system works and what we need to do to fit into that system我们就想只有这样我们才能够得到爱。

这是非常自然的一个孩子他是非常幼小以及脆弱的他需要去观察家庭系统的运作方式，然后再让自己去适应以及适合这样的家庭 And if we were in families that had difficulty around needs。

 we learned very early that we should not express our needs。

 that it wasn't really welcomed and it wasn't really safe。如果我们在一个对于需求并不重视的原生家庭长大，我们就会学习到我不能去表达自己的需求。

不能够安全的去提出自己的需求。We all learned this， so we learned。To survive， we had to。

push down our needs that it wasn't a safe place to look to our parents for our needs我们就学会了在自己长大的过程当中。

需要压抑自己的需求，这样才能生存下来。我去表达自己的需求是不安全的。Actually， as children。

 we look more what do our parents need from us， not what do we need from them事实上当我们还是个孩子的时候我们更加重视的是父母希望从我这里要满足的需求是什么。

也就是他们的需求是什么 So our attention is always if I can give my parents what they expect what what do they expect how can I fulfill their expectations and make them proud所以我们的注意力往往都是在外面去观察着我父母对我的期待是什么。

我将如何去满足他呢让他们感觉到骄傲 Then maybe they will love me and be happy that I am their child。这样的话，也许他们就会爱我。

而且会因为我是他们的孩子而快乐。And we have to remember that the family system is all that we know that is where we learn everything about love and about relationship that's where we learn it我们需要去知道啊。

当我们还是个孩子的时候，我们的家庭系统就是我们所有的世界就是在这个世界里我们去学习爱以及关系。And even if our parents don't say directly what they expect。

 we feel it， and we try to give them what they expect。

 whatever that is so that we fit in and we belong in that family system。即便我们的父母不会明说。

但是我们都会深切的去感受到他们对自己的期待。无论他们的期待是什么，我们都会想要去满足，以便于自己能够适应这样的家庭。So part of that fitting in。

 we had the feeling that if we express our needs， it's not respectful to our parents。那就是因为这样的原因啊。

为了适应这样的家庭，我们会觉得当我们表达了自己的需求，就好像是并没有尊重自己的父母一样。So that's where we have to have a lot of acceptance for ourselves that by the time we become adults。

 we really have no idea what we need就是因为这样的原因，我们需要去接受这样一个事实当我们成年之后我们可能根本不清楚自己的需求究竟是什么。

And where it gets really interesting is that a child needs two things。

 it needs to fit into the family and belong and feel safe。非常有意思的是啊，在其中包含着两点。第一点是一个孩子，他需要能够去适应自己的家庭。

感受到这种归属感以及安全感。That the child also needs to grow to become more independent and more。

Individualivual但除此之外呢，孩子还需要能够去成长，变成一个独立的个体。I'll give you a little example， say you grow up。And。

You want to。Learn the piano。给大家举一个例子啊，比如说你长大了，你想要学习钢琴。Or you want to be an artist。

 You love to paint或者你想成为一个艺术家，你喜欢画画。But your mother wants you to become good in mathematics and good in science。

 What is she going to do？但是你的母亲呢，希望你好好的学数学和科学，你该怎么办呢？

The part of you that wants to belong wants to fulfill your parents' desires for you。你那一个想要归属于家庭的自己呢。

特别想要去满足自己父母的期待。So the part of you that wants to express yourself and follow your own inner desires。

There's a conflict between being yourself and fitting into the family and all of us have had this in small ways or even in big ways那么这个时候呢想要全然的去表达自己跟随自己内在心灵召唤的部分呢却又觉得非常的两难了所以我们每一个人都或多或少的拥有这样的冲突 so part of our difficulty with our needs is what do we do when our needs are in conflict with other people's needs how do we what do we do。

所以当我们自己的需求在跟他人产生冲突的时候，我们该怎么办呢？Because this is the difficult part of me let's say you're a girl and you fall in love with a boy and you want to be with that boy这是一个需求非常艰难的部分啊比如说你是一个女孩子你爱上了一个男孩子。

你想要跟他在一起 but your parents don't approve of that boy they want you to have a different boy。

但是你的父母呢并不喜欢他，他希望他们希望你跟其他人在一起。So you're in trouble。 you want to go here and your parents want you to go there What are you going do and whatever way you go difficult难那边想去那边你想去另一边论你怎么样好难press want parents are really抑难希避所有的些冲突这就是压抑需求的原因。

P your hand up if you understand that a little bit。如果你能够理解我刚才所说的，请举收。

I see a lot of hands and a lot of hands it's right， you know we have these。😊，Two human needs。

 one is to be ourselves and follow our own desires。

 and the other is to fit in and belong to our families。我看到了很多手举起来啊，我们都有这样的情况。我们内在有一个渴望，想要全然的表达自己，做自己。

还有另外一个渴望，想要去归属以及适应自己的家族。So you see the problem with desires。

 needs a very difficult because we have two sets of needs， one is for independence。To be ourselves。

所以说到渴望啊，也情 take the hands down and I'll go back to gallery。嗯。

我们请工作人帮我们把手先放下 and this shows up when we get into a relationship because we want to be ourselves and we want to have freedom。

 We want to have independence。那我们的渴望和需求呢都是有这样双重的面向。一方面我们想要做自己，一方面我们就想要去归属。在我们的关系当中，这样的情况就出现了。

我们非常渴望想要成为一个独立的自己。And on the other side， we want to have love， we want to feel harmony。

 we want to be close to someone。All through our life。

 we have to balance these two different deeds in ourselves。我们既想要独立的自己，自由的自己，我们又希望能够去归属一个人。

去感受跟他之间的连接和爱。我们终其一生都在平衡着需求的这两个面向。Now， if those of you who've done some understood my work。

 this leads us into a very interesting。D嗯，我想说啊呃比较了解我工作的同学呢，应该都会明白啊，就会把我们带入一个非常有意思的模型里面。

Because those needs are not equal inside of us， some of us need to be close and need more love and need to be in。

Connection to people and that's our。Predominantly， that's our stronger need。那么这两个需求呢，在我们的内在。

他们并不是完全一样的，并不是平衡的。对于有某一些人来说呢，他们可能更想要去感受到一种归属感、连接感和爱。这个对他们来说是更加原始的一种驱动力。And those people。

 the drive for love， for relationship， for belonging is their strongest need。但对于另一些人呢。

他们可能更想要感受到呃这种呃属于个人的这种爱和归属感可能更加的强烈。 and their need for independence and freedom and self expression is their smaller need。

他会觉得我的个人表达，或者我的独立性和和自由可能相对弱一点点。So the people who need love， we call them the dependent。

The people who need love need love more than freedom we call the dependent because they really need somebody else嗯。

那某对于某些人来说呢，他们可能对爱的需求更多，相对于自己的自由，他更加需要爱。我们把这样的人呢叫做是依赖型的人格。And the other people who need more freedom。

 more independence， more space for themselves， they don't need。Love so much。

 We call them the antidependent。那么我们说这些更加需要自由，更加需要自我表达的这样的一些人呢，他们是反依赖性人格。

 And it's so important to understand these two。 So I want to explain this in terms of two types of people。

那么了解这两种人格非常的重要。所以呢我详细的给大家解释一下。 And this also relates to how you learned about your needs and about love in the family of origin。

那么这个也关乎于我们在原生家庭当中如何学习爱与需求。And this is so important to understand because when you get into adult relationships。

 these two parts the dependent and the antidependent are always present in an adult relationship当我们成年之后进入到了一个关系里面。

我们就能够看到这个依赖性和反依赖性永远都是在这个关系当中会呈现出来的。So how it works is this， the dependent。

Comes from a family where as a child， they did not get enough love。

 they did not get enough attention。那这两种人格是怎么互动的呢？首先说一下依赖性人格，这样的人往往在原生家庭当中没有得到过足够多的爱与关注。

 whatever the reason or they got too much pressure from the parents。And too much discipline。

 but not enough love， not enough touch， not enough attention， mostly not enough attention。那因为某种原因啊。

这种依赖型人格，他们在原始家庭当中得到了太过多的管教，而没有足够多的爱与关注。呃，重要的是关注的部分。

 They really came out of families where their emotional needs for contact， for being seen。

 for attention。 These needs were simply not met enough。在他的原生家庭当中，这种被看见、被温情的抚触连接和关注的需求都没有足够的被满足。

 And this often happens when either the parents are working very hard and they have no no time for the child。

那当然有几种原因啊，有一种原因可能是呃其中一方父母或者父母工作太过的忙碌，没有办法去注意到这个孩子。 or perhaps where the father has to work in another town and the mother is。

So has it such a difficult time to manage。Everything that she has to do so she doesn't have the energy or the time to give the child as much as it needs。

也有可能啊父亲在比较远的地方工作。母亲一个人没有足够的精力和时间顾及到方方面面。这个时候孩子就没有得到足够多的关照。

 the truth is we have to understand that when were a child。

 we need and we need a lot and that's okay because that's how it is when you're a child。我们需要认识到啊。

当我们还是个孩子的时候，我们是有很多需求的，这是非常自然的。因为我们还是个孩子。So when we grow up in these kind of families where we don't get touched and we don't have time with our parents and we don't feel special and we don't feel loved and we don't feel wanted。

 we come to adult life hungry for love， starving for love。当我们成长在这样一个原生的家庭当中，我们没有得到足够多的爱，足够多的看见。

足够多的辅助，以及被喜爱的感觉。在我们成年之后，内心就带着这种对爱的如饥似渴。And when we look for a love partner。

 we look for someone who can give us what we need， we want to be close with another person。

当我们在寻找自己伴侣的时候，我们寻找的是一种被爱的感觉。我们希望能够跟一个人亲密。And we believe that finally。

 if we can find the right person。All our problems will be solved。

 We will at last get all the love that we did not get as a child。这个时候我们所持有的信念就是若能找到那个爱我的人。

我所有儿时没有得到的爱都会被满足。We have a very romantic idea about love。

 we really think here finally I will be happy。我们会对爱有着一种过于美化的浪漫的幻想，会觉得说在这里，终于我的一切都会变得更好了。

So we build up inside us a lot of hope and a lot of romantic dreams about the love that。

We'll finally be happy。在这个时候，我们在内在就构建了很多虚假的希望以及浪漫的幻想，觉得说我在这里拥有了爱，一切都会幸福了。

 So when somebody shows us a little bit of love， a little bit of kindness or a little bit of affection。

 we immediately attached to them。 we grab a hold of them。这个时候当某人给我们一点点小恩小惠，一点点的爱，我们就会马上去抓去。😊。

We attach very quickly and very strongly，嗯么会非常迅速以及啊稳固的抓着不放。

And we want to be with that person all the time every day we don't want to be separate even for a minute it's so intense那候 contact all the time那这候我们感受非常强烈我们无时无刻不想跟这个人在一起我们想永远的跟他在一起。

希望跟他能够接触亲密。So we have a very， very big desire for love， very big need for love， attention。

 affection那这个时候我们对于爱对于关注的需求非常的巨大，非常强烈 okay， the opposite is a child who is mistrustful of love。

那么与之相反的呢，是一个不信任爱的孩子。This is a child who very early in the family。Was。嗯。Used for the parents' needs。

那这样的孩子呢，在原始家庭当中经常是需要去满足父母的需求的。A very common example is if the mother and the father are not getting along so good and that relationship is distant。

很好的一。呃，当父亲和母亲的关系非呃不是很好，两个人之间有一段距离的时候。Then the parents look to the children for the parents emotional needs。

那这个时候父母呢他就希望能够借诱孩子去满足自己的情感需求。 Mostly it is that the mother looks to the son to be the replacement husband。

 not sexually， of course，通常情况下是母亲会把自己的儿子当成丈夫的替代品。It's not a sexual relationship。

 but it's a deep emotional relationship so that the young boy feels that he has to take care of his mother's emotional needs。

这当然不是一个性爱上面的替代和需求，而是说在情感上，这个母亲会把自己的儿子当成是丈夫一样的去满足自己的各种情感上。

 he feels responsible for his mother not for himself。那这个时候这个孩子感觉到我应该为自己的母亲负责，我要忘掉自己所有的需求了。

 and it also happens from fathers to daughters， but not as much。那很多情况也是父亲跟女儿之间有这样的关系。

但是比起母亲跟儿子就没有那么的多。So we call this a role reversal that the child becomes the parent and the parents become the child。

 it's a very confusing energy in the family。那我们就把它叫成是呃叫做是角色的转换，或者呃角色的这种倒转啊。就经常会在家庭的情况下出现这样的情况。

And these children grow up very fast， they're never allowed to play， they always have to be serious。

 they always have to be little adults， they can never be children。

Carefree playing with other children， they always have to be like an adult really。

 they miss their whole childhood and that's very sad。这样的孩子，他可以很快的速度成年，因为他们从来没有被允许自由自在的去玩耍。

他们总是要非常的严肃正经，像一个小大人一般去做事情。So when these people get into relationships， they' much more walled off。

 they much more。Anxious about getting attached。那么当这样的孩子啊，这样的孩子成年之后进入到一段关系里，他往往是一种情感隔离的状态。他非常的焦虑。呃。

对于这种两个人之间的连接，他非常的害怕。 It's not that they don't want love。 They like love， but they don't want bonding。

 They want to have love and then run away and have love and then run away。

 They don't want to stay attached。并不是说啊这样的人呢他不需要爱，他同样是渴望爱的，只不过他特别害怕因爱而来的束缚。所以呢当他喜欢爱，他就会走进爱，然后马上又逃跑了。

走近又逃跑，忽近忽远，他不希望自己被束缚。So you can start to see how these needs play out if the dependent person wants to be attached all the time and the minute the other person needs to separate the dependent person panics because they feel abandoned。

我们能够看到这两种人格在一段关系里的这样的关系的形态啊，这个依赖型人格呢，他特别想要去抓取，想要爱，想要去连接，无时无刻不在一起。而这个反依赖型人格呢，他特别害怕自己被束缚，他就想逃离。

但是当这个反依赖性人一逃离依赖型人格，他就会觉得非常的恐慌以及害怕。 So this is very。

 very difficult when you get somebody who needs to be close all the time and somebody who finds that literally suffocating they can't breathe这个局面啊是非常困难的。

一个人无时无刻的都想要关注，而另一个人感觉到自己都要窒息了。So what do we do about that Well， this is where the question comes。

 how do we manage our own needs so we don't if we're a dependent。

 how do we manage our own needs so that we don't。ACcross the boundaries of the other person and make them want to run away from us。

那问题在这个时候就出现了，我们将如何去处理这样的局面的。作为一个依赖型人格啊，我们就需要去学习如何去管理自己的界限。这样我们不至于去跨越到他人的边界，让对方感觉到窒息。

So this is where two people have to work out together when we get into a relationship。

 what are your needs and what are my needs so I want to go over with you what are basic needs why do we go into relationship。

那么在这样的一段关系里呢，双方都需要非常认真的去了解自己和对方的需求是什么。那么在接下来的时间，我就将跟大家一起去感觉一下我们基本的需求都有哪些。You know。

 one of the things we have to understand is that when we get to relationship。

 it's not just about finding somebody who can give you what you need that that is a wrong way to look at it。

首先我们需要去知道，一段关系，并不意味着我们需要去找到一个满足自己需求的人，这是一个非常错误的建定。 You know， relationship is not a business deal。

 It's not a transaction。 You give me this。 I give you that， and it's all good。 We write a contract。

It's much more than that。关系他跟交易不同，他并不是两个人遇见签了一份合约，你给我这个你给我那个关系完全不同。

You know the human being is an intimate creature， it wants closeness。

 we are built that way it's in our DNA， it's not something that we learn it's in our DNA to have closeness with another person that's what we are we're not reptiles。

not人类它本身就是一个非常渴望的生灵。我们对于这种关系的渴望，对于亲密的渴望，它本身就在我们的内在。它在我们的基因里面，这并不是我们后天习得的一种需求，我们并不是这些爬行动物，我们也不是蜥蜴。

我们是一个内在渴望亲密的人类。 You know， when the early psychologists were studying our needs our needs for closeness。

 they had two monkeys。那么在早期心理学家研究人类对于亲密的需求的时候呢，他能找到了两只猴子。

 One monkey only got food but no touch just got food， but no human contact。那其中的一个猴子呢，他只有食物。

但是没有任何的抚触和爱。The other monkey got food and a lot of human content。那么另一只猴子呢，它既有食物，也有很多人类对它的付出。

The first monkey after two weeks with no human contact， only food died。那么第一个猴子呢，它只有食物。

没有任何人类的关还及复出两个星期之后就死亡了。We don't manage without human warmth。

 so human contact is really necessary for us to thrive， to survive。所以这种人类的温度以及人类的抚触，对于我们的成长以及绽放来说，呃。

繁盛来说是必不可少的。But when we get to human relationships， it's not only about having your baby needs met or your child needs met。

 it's about your adult needs also。但是当我们进入到一段关系里，我们要知道的是啊，他不仅仅是要关乎于去满足我们儿时的这些婴儿一般的需求。

我们更多的是要关注在自己作为一个成年人的需求入后得到满足。 Our child needs or mostly needs for security。

 We want to feel safe and we want to feel secure。我们儿时的主要需求是安全感。

Our adult needs are needs to grow to develop our potential。但是我们成年的需求更多的是成长，以及去发展自己的潜能。

 and our adult relationships， part of our adult relationships is to support each other。

 to grow up and to develop our。Our intelligence， our creativity， our power， our passion。

 that's why we're together to become more， not to become less。所以成年的亲密关系有一部非有一部分非常重要的原因，就是我们能够彼此支持。

彼此刁琢，能够更多的活出自己的潜能，而不是让自己变得更加的黯淡无光。这是成年的亲密关系，一个非常重要的意义所在。Our relationships。

 if we only want to be a baby or a young child， our relationships will sooner or later。Collapse。

 they won't grow。 They won't go。Stronger and more powerful， and more alive。在一段成年的关系当中。

若我们仅仅是停留在自己幼儿、婴儿般的需求，那么这段关系很快就会失去他的生命力。因为作为一个成年人，我们内在自然的驱动力就是能够去成长，去发展，让自己更多的活出自己。

So we want to create relationships that are dynamic that work together to be more intense and more powerful所以我们希望能够进入到或者说建立起这样的一段成年的关系。

它是充满活力的它是能够彼此助力和支持的。So we do that by developing the two parts of ourselves。

 the part of us that can be soft and loving and open。

 and by developing the part of us that can stand on our own feet and be independent。

所以因为我们要去建立这样的成年人的呃关系，我们就需要去培养自己的两个面相。一个面相是非常轻柔有爱的。另一个面相是我们能够全然的掌控自己生命的力量，为自己去负责。

让自己变得更加的强大 and in an ideal family When our parents really understand the needs of a child。

 the needs for love and the needs for independence。那么在一个家庭当中，当父母能够去了解孩子的这两方面的需求，一方面的需求是呃希望安全感与爱和连接。

另一方面是他有这种独立的成长，成为个体的需求。 because you know， maybe our parents， they didn't really understand。

 but when you become parents， you have to support the child's needs for love。

 but also support the child's needs to develop their own independence and their own trust in themselves。

 So they're not always so dependent， they they can become。They can trust themselves。

 they can stand on their own feet。也许我们的父母他对这些方面并没有太多的了解，但是我们自己作为父母，我们需要去尽力的支持孩子的这两种需求。

一方面是对于连接爱和安全感的需求。另一方面我们需要去支持他，能够去独立的呃以个体呃能够去独立的信任他自己内在的这一个来自于个体的声音。这样的话他就不会成为一个过度依赖的一个人。Yes so。嗯。

I'll do a little exercise with you in a minute， so the dependent person has to learn to be more on their own feet。

 more able to look after themselves so they don't come to relationship。

And suffocate the person they're with。所以依赖型的人格呢，他更多的是需要学会如何的去关照自己，去满足自己的需求。这样的话他就不会走进一段关系里，让对方感觉到窒息了。

And the antidepend has to learn to give good boundaries。而反依赖型的人格呢，他需要去学习如何能够建立好良好的界限。

You see in the family， the child cannot say to the parents I don't want to be what you want I'm going to give you a boundary。

 it doesn't work that way， children have no boundaries。我们看到在家庭当中，孩子是不可能跟父母之间划清一个非常清楚的边界的。他没有办法说。

我不想听你的这个话，我就想跟你之间有这样一个界限。So antidepends， when they come into adult relationships have to be able to say。

 I can open up to you， but I also need space， I cannot be here 24 hours a day with you。

If they could be clear and put up clear boundaries， they would not be so afraid of being intimate。

那么反义性反意赖型人格在一段关系，若能够有良好的界限啊，他可能就会说我非常的爱你，但是我不能够24小时都无微不至的照顾你，我也需要自己的时间。当他能够这样建立自己界限的时候。

他就不会对于亲密过多的恐惧了。Is that clear I hope that's clear so that's what we're working with how to work with all our different needs。

 the needs for closeness， the needs for contact and the needs for independence and space and freedom。

那这个就是我们去面对这两种需求的态度，一种是对于爱连接安全感的需求，另一种是对于这种独立空间成长的需求。我希望大家能够理解，希望刚才讲的清楚。

 So I'd like to do a little breathing exercise with you to show you a little bit about。

Coming close and coming back to yourself let's take a two minutes break for the bathroom and then I'll be back and we'll do some just some little exercise会一短呼的练习让我们去练习一下如何走近走远这样一个练习会有两分钟的上厕时 bathroom some questions and do some exercises'll have a 15 minutes分钟息答环节会有一长的休息。

To feel that you are。Complete in yourself。 See， even if we've been a dependent。

 So how I want to do this is I want you to。Take。Imagine that you can take all the love energy from the universe and bring it into your body。

或者说灌输进自己的身体里。And then you bring it to your heart。🎼来到自己的心。🎼And you tell yourself。

🎼And we do that a few times you fill yourself up。🎼我们来重复几次，把自己装满。And bringing it down to your heart。

🎼装满，然后双手来到心口。And this is especially important。😊，🎼When we didn't get all the love we needed in the family。

🎼特别是当我们在家庭当中没有得到足够多的爱，这个练习就变得非常的重要了。It's an exercise to say， I take all。

The beautiful energy from the universe。And I bring it to my own heart。🎼我能够接受到所有宇宙美好的能量，并让它溜进我的心灵。

Beautiful anyway。Bring it to your。把他带到你的心灵。🎼This is especially important when you are a dependent and you imagine that you look to someone else and you want to get everything from them。

🎼当你是当你是一个依赖性人格啊，这个练习就非常的重要。特别是当你看着你的伴侣，认为自己的所有的需求都应该经由他满足的时候，你就应该多多联习这个。

🎼And then we do the same for the earth， you go down to the ground。

 you take the energy from the earth。🎼S大我们也会做同样的练习啊。从大地带来能量放到自的心中。🎼下一步接收了大地的能量，从下接收能量放在心中。🎼去。And then。

It says if。🎼You come to meet somebody。🎼And you have energy， you're not a beggar， you see？

🎼So you have energy in your heart。 So let's touch our hearts。好让我们双手放在心口，当你能够多做这个练习的时候，你就不会是一个爱的乞讨者。

你会充满能量 and feel that I have something to offer to share with somebody else就感觉到我是有一份东西能够与其他人分享的。我能够给予。

And then I'd like you to imagine。🎼Close your eyes and imagine in front of you is somebody that you really。

🎼Are attracted to。🎼闭上双眼去观赏，在你的面前是你非常喜欢的人。And。🎼From your full heart。

 from a place where you have energy。You offer yourself。🎼那当你感受到了自己满满的心，充满着活力和能量的心，你就把双手张开向前去伸。

🎼And you have the feeling I want to share my love with you。🎼并且内心去感受我想跟你去分享我的爱。

I want to be an equal to you。🎼我想要跟你成为平等的。🎼I offer you。Love and I receive your love。🎼我想把爱给你。

我也能够从你那里得到爱。🎼So let's feel this movement I offer you love好，让我们去感受一下这个动作，向外给予爱。🎼。😊，🎼好再把爱带到自己的内在。😊。

🎼That's real adult connection， you come from a place of fullness。这是一个真实的成年人之间的连接。因为我们是由内在的圆满而付出的。

And you offer。🎼Your gift。把你的礼物送给另一个人。Without conditions。没有任何的附加条件。 And this you take that。

🎼然后再把你接收到的拿回来。🎼And you feel that。🎼This flow of。Giving and receiving is a beautiful way。

To meet someone。🎼你会感受到这种狮与兽的流动，是一种非常美好的遇见他人的方式。So what I'm going to ask for for my music person。

 we're going to have some dance music just a little bit and we're going to do the same movement in the dance we're going to offer our heart and we're going to take it。

🎼Take somebody's energy back so you learn to flow with another person。

 So make the movement a bit bigger now， bigger movement。好，邀请我们的工作人员帮我们放一个舞动的音乐。好，让我们把身体的幅度加大。

Okay and make contact music好大起立请请大起来。ok， let me have some dancing music好，让我让我们听一下这个舞动的音乐啊，放一些舞动的音乐。在。

I'm waiting。好，先等待我们的音乐，大家活动一下。That's it， do that movement。就是这样的动作。

我们音乐可以慢慢停下了。😊，Beautiful。太美了啊，大家。So what I want to show you with that is that connecting with yourself and connecting with another person is a dance。

 is like a dance。我想让大家感觉到的是啊，与自己的连接以及连接他人，就像一场舞蹈。Its playful。

 it's not you grab hold of someone and you bite them and you never let them go他是他是非常顽皮的，并不是说你抓这个人咬一口。

永远都不放他走了的感觉。Because if， you know， for dependence， when you get too attached too quickly。

 too intensely， you frighten the other person， they feel afraid你是一个依赖性人格。

It makes them feel anxious and they want to run away就你是一个依赖性人格。如果你太过用力的，太过迅速的去抓取对方，对方会受不了，他会想逃跑的。

And when they try to run away and we chase after them， that makes them even more shut down。若他开始逃跑。

你又开始追他的话，就会让他更加的关闭。So this what we're doing is it starts with you feeling connected to yourself and connected to the universe所以我们所做的这个练习呢是能够让你去感觉与自己的连接与宇宙的连接。

So。I just want you to take a moment to feel that in your own。Because， you know。

I want to give you information， but I want you to feel that information in your bodies。

Coming to your bodies。大家知道吗？我确实是需要给大家一些资讯，但是我希望大家能够在自己的身体当中去感受这些资讯。Yeah。

What I'd like to do before I take your questions is ask you to put your hands get in the triangle。

好现在大把食指的指轻轻的相触变成一个三角形 Put the triangle in your lap。放到大腿上。Bring all this energy into your body。

把所有的流量 into your body。去接收所有来自宇宙的能量，从头到脚。And very important now， feel your feet。

 feel your legs come into your body。非常重要的是要感受你的双脚、双腿连接大地。进入到你的身体里。Yeah。It's。Just feel your body。

 your feet， your legs， your seat。去感受你的身体，感受你的双腿、双脚，还有你的坐骨。And just breathe a few times in yourself。

And then I want to start the questions。好，就这样重复几轮呼吸，回归自己。安顿下来之后，我们等一下开始答疑。是。Okay。

So I just before I take the questions， I would like to just have one or two of you say how you're feeling。

 I would like you to unmute。好，在答疑之前呢，我想邀请1到2位同学去分享一下你的感受是怎么样。嗯，你可以直接。

Do we ask are Alice just like one of them？Yes yes let me just hear from a few people how they are because then I know how the group is going before I take the questions so i'd like to hear from a few participants just some how are you feeling cool那请 Alice帮我们选一下几位同学分享一下他的感受。

好的嗯，如果你要提问，请Yes， I could take three or four people before4位就可以了。嗯，好，那我们先请OK， Alice。

 let somebody talk to me。嗯。四班的临。四班的 Lin Tong，他在演讲者的 could you please shift to the speaker's view？

 She's already on that。Sure。Thanks， sure， hi。你好你好，我本来是想提问的，所以蹭蹭的就把手给举起来了，然后先Q的这一趴。嗯， actually。

 I wanted to ask a questionO。😊，啊，那个我也谈一下刚才的感受，就是两个手给出去的时候。我不乐意，我想赶紧的回来，然后让我给一个手是OK的。

My feeling in the previous practice was that I feel I'm reluctant to give with both a hand。

 one hand is okay for me。That's okay， you know， that's okay。

That might make you feel safer it gives you a little bit more safety that's okay， you know。

 you need to go slowly so you could feel more safe and I would say that's really okay that's very honest I really appreciate your honesty我非常欣赏你的真实啊这一只手可能让你更加有安全感所以我觉得非常的好这个需要一步一步来慢慢。

And I find that very intelligent actually because。You need to be very safe before you put all your hands in you hands safe。

您的感觉是非常有智慧的。我们首先需要感受到安全感，才能够双手的去给予，非常好。我之前就是像老师说的，就是从小呃爷爷奶奶带大的，然后是管的非常严格。呃，大概在可能35岁以前，我都是这种拼命的呃想要爱呃。

甚至可能前两年那个某些督导或者助教都会说我有一种飞蛾扑火的感觉。I I'm that kind of child who was raised by grandparents and heavily disciplined and I was longing for love a lot before 35 and many people including classmates and teachers。

 comment on me that I am like a mot flying to the fire。You know。

 you have to be kind to yourself as a child you didn't get as much as you needed， that's true。

That's true。So what do we do， you know， it's a big question when we didn't get what we needed as a child。

 how do we deal with it as an adult？那么这时候呢我们都需要对自己好一点，我们需要去认可自己童年，没有得到足够多的爱。但当我们成年之后，就需要去思考这个问题。

我们将如何去处理来自于童年的这些缺失呢？So let me ask you something when you think about your childhood and that you really。

Didn't get what you needed， how does it make you feel？我想问你 make you emotional。当你在想到童年自己缺失的时候。

你会有什么样的感觉呢？会让你突然间的情绪失控吗？嗯，会的，我现在已经就是不是在这个现在的这个直播的话，我估计就已经泪流满面。现在只是控制眼泪没出来而已，然后他就出来了。然后那个嗯。

我我小的时候就是爷爷奶奶就是除了说管教特别严，好像每走一步做任何事说任何话都是可以跳出毛病来的。然后更多的是躯体上其实都会有侵犯，就是会有这种打骂。所以对于我来说这个我出去现在长大之后从来都不点菜。

就我不知道要点什么菜。然后在工作中如果下属有挑战的话，其实对于我来说也是比较难解决。我不知道是要关爱他们，还是说要给他们这个ruse，让他们去好好的去。我我现在就变得很看上去很佛系。

让他们自己来选择他们的工作上的这个去留。但是这种我觉得很没有力量。 actually that makes me really emotional。I would be drown by tears。

 if it's not in the online sessions。 when I was little my grandparents。Extremely picky me。

 and sometimes I was physically disciplined。And when I reach adulthood。

 I never order any dishes in restaurant because I don't have any individual ideas about choices and I dont have I don't know how to manage my employees when they have troubles I don't know how to connect with them and so my attitude is kind of chill out but that makes me feel really weak。

No， you're not weak， actually you're very conscious okay。Let's let's go slowly实际上你你不是像你说的那样，没有任何的力量。

你是非常有意识，非常有觉察的，让我们1。1点的来。 So the first step for you and all of us who felt as children we were neglected。

 the first step那对于这些童年的时候，感觉到被忽视的孩子来说呢，第一步是这样的。Is when you get close to somebody， a man， a friend。

 it's very important that you say to them， I am a child， I was a child。

Who didn't get as much love as I needed So I a big need当一人或者一位朋友，我在跟他交往之前呢非常重要的。

我们需要去表达清楚我一个童年没有得到过足够足够关爱的人。所以呢我可能需要很的关 can。Let's do it together。 I am a child。

 I was a child who didn't get what she needed all。 Let's start with them。 let me hear you让我们来吧。

你说这样的一句话 needed我是一个没有。得到足够多的关爱的，或者说我的需求没有被满足的这样一个孩子。Slowly dad。

 I was a child who didn't get what she needed。's good slowly very generous一个童年没有得到足够关爱的孩子。

That's right。Okay， good， good， that's good， and I have a big need inside and I have a big need inside。

我内在有很大的需求。😔，我内在有很大需求，我靠这里好痛啊，i feel so so much pain heres not over那现在呢我们要避免线路啊，跟避陷入过多情绪 over你太过情绪。

你就去了跟自的连接这样可以 and to cope with the emotions do showed好跟我一起轻柔的做这个动作 just make like this。就用这样的方式对待你的情绪。

就是这样的 emotionsgo through your hands好，让这个情绪流进你的双手。good work ，good work，很好，非常好。

And I am trying to manage my own needs， trying to manage my needs。 That's all you can do。我正在管理我的需求。

我正在管理我的需求。Good well done， that's the first step There are other steps。

 but I just want you to start with the first step有很多的步骤啊，但是现在呢我们就做第一步。And just a little I did， yes。嗯。

沙老师，刚才你的那个练习，其实我有一点感受到，就之前呃那个evenlig，然后有解答我一个问题的时候，让我去扎根。所以后来我就去跟一个太极的老师去学了这种就是站桩与天地的连接。我不知道是不是有这个关系。

大概从上一个月开始，我渐渐的找到了一点点这种既可以独立又可以去爱的这个状态，就是我突然有一天躺在床上说了一句话，就是哎呀我要开始自己为自己负责了，就是从那一刻开始，我觉得我人生有一点变化。

不知道是不是跟那个太极有关。 need was feeling a lot in your exercises also Dr。

ligan told me maybe I need more grounding so I learned stance with one of the masters and been practicing for's wonderful's so great。

You know， I think you're doing really well， I think you're doing really well。那山姗老师说非常的棒啊，他觉得你做做的非常的好。

我可以好奇一下后面的步骤嘛，除了说承认自己是个be a。你没 don't need translations，老师说你不要着急啊。😊，Don't be in a hurry。

 you know this work to heal from the childhood it's a lifetime's work we don't do it in two days it's you take your whole adult life to keep working with parts of your childhood。

童年的疗愈是一生的功课，不可能两天一蹴而就的s betterI need to just check with Alice for a moment because I should be doing a demo soon。

 So I need somebody to help me with my structure。 thank you so much。非常感谢。😊，请问一下爱ice，我们还有时间？Alice。

 can I have Alice for a moment or Sherry？Alice Alice I Should I do that now Alice said you can do demo or Q A。

I think I should do this one demo then we'll take a break then we'll do QA休再 and one question to Alice do I answer the questions that I got printed today or should I just ask participants questions but let me do the demo first let me do the demo then we take a short break you you were great。

Hello， are you， Jerry。你是jerry吗？jery可以解除一下静音。Okay， Jerry。

 I think I'd like you just to tell me what you think is important for me to know。那jerry。

 no我想你能跟我I have some information， but I like to hear it from you directly那jery我已经了解你一些情况了。

但是我想直接从你那里啊听一听你觉得有哪一些重要的讯息是我需要先了解的，你可以告诉我。嗯，我觉得我的性格里面有一些。比较自我，然后在关系中比较逃皮冲突的那种成分。嗯，然后我不太会跟妻子处理这个亲密关系。

嗯。反正挺孤独的，有时候觉得其实挺冷。I think I'm quite self centered。😔。

And I tend to avoid conflicts im such a loner and don't know how to deal with intimacy with my wife Okay。

 you know， Jerry， I think it's so good if you take a moment to go back and you tell me a little bit about how did you learn about love in the family do you can you relate。

How you are as an adult man。With your difficulty to， you know， as you say， feel more protected。

 not be able to express my love。Can you tell me something about your family。

 about your mother about your father， were you an only child did you grow up with your family give me some family background可以跟我聊聊你的原家吧现在的种作为一孤独的人好像不太容易表达自己那么你的父亲母亲家庭是怎样的呢？

嗯，我呃我有一个妹妹，我们家是4个人，然后呃。我妈妈呃从小我记忆中我妈妈比较情绪化嗯。对我大部分时间是很溺爱的。哎，有的时候甚至我还记得小时候。我早上不喜欢吃鸡蛋，他就一定要强迫我吃那种那种溺爱。

有的时候有一种这样的感觉。嗯，然后有的时候他又比较情绪化，情绪化的时候就嗯就会就。诶。就会让我感觉到啊。其实那个情绪化有可能不是对我是对我父亲，但是我会感觉到嗯。

那种察言会让我自己慢慢形成一种察言观色的一种呃一种习惯。嗯。然后我再。嗯，家庭里面我觉得我奶奶对我特别的疼爱。嗯，好，就先让我先让我翻译这个部分给老师啊，让他先了解一下。嗯hi Sharon。

 my family is a family of four。 I have a younger sister。 My mom is quite emotional。

 and she tends to spell me a lot spoilre me a lot。bo you a lot。 Are you the early boy。😊。

so a lot of attention came on you所以他给你过多的关注。And shes also actually the way she's being emotional is directed to my dad。

 but which led me into observing。Her change of mood。

So when you say emotional towards your father in what kind of emotion。

 positive emotion or negative emotion negative。后面。What like anger or想愤怒还是。对，是生气和抱怨。

Complaining and complaining okay okay， so when you as a young boy watched your mother complaining with your father。

 what happened inside you， what did that make you feel当你看到母亲对父亲抱怨的时候你内在有什么样的感觉。我觉得我不想成为父亲那样子。

I don't want to become someone like my dad。That's right。That's red。s明白了。It's red。

Say that I'd like you to say I want to make it a bit more strong， can we do that a bit more strong。

 I want you to say as if you would say it to him。Dad。

 I don't want to be like you I don't want to be like you那 Jerry呢，你说这句话说爸爸我不想想你't want to be like you。

不想想你好了。我不想像你。I want to be different。我想要变得不同。😔，行我跟你不一样。Take a deep breath， Feel it。深呼吸一下。

Now it's very complex because。When you watched your parents in conflict and your mother complaining to your father。

Who did you want to protect？Did you want to protect any of them？当你看到你母亲对父亲抱怨和指责的时候，你想要保护的是谁？

你有没有想保护他们其中一方的渴望？嗯，我潜意识里面可能觉得。保护父亲吧。Subconsciously， maybe my father。 I'm not sure。 so。 I think so。

 I think so。 I think。Okay， so let's imagine your father sitting next to you。

 I want you to put your arm around him because on the one hand， it's very complex。

 you didn't want to be like him on the other hand， you wanted to。就 tell a daddy it'sO啊有一点复杂。

一方面呢你不想活成像他一样，但是一方面你又想告诉他，父亲就非常的争常，没有关系。You mentioned， you just put your on。去想象你把你的一只手放在他的肩膀上，告诉他。

爸爸真没关系。啊，这没关系。How does that make you feel now？你现在有什么感觉？😔，感觉。Take your time， take your time， Jerry。

 take your time， just take your time to feel yourself。I relaxed a bit， I that yes， yes， yes。

 I think it was very difficult for you to see that very difficult。我觉得看到这一点非常的不容易。 know。

 when a child observes the parents in conflict。There are。

 there's always somebody you want to protect， either you want to make the couple back together。

那么当一个孩子看到自己的父母这样的时候，我们总会有一方是想要保护的，或者我们想要让两个人能够重归于好。

Or you want to protect one parent from the other一会我们想保护其中一方。

So you learn to observe conflict you see and as you say I now as an adult man。

 I want to avoid conflict这个时候呢我们就学会了察言观色那之后变成一个成年人之后，可能就想要去逃避冲突就像你说的那样。

That's the first thing you said to me when you were talking about your partner， your wife。

 I don't want any conflict。那，这是你跟我说的第一句话。当你谈到太台的时候，你也说自己总是想逃避冲突。对。嗯。

So that comes directly from the family， you see， you saw conflict in the family。

 it was very painful for you。所以这是来自于一个充满冲突的家庭，我们所承受到的那种痛苦。嗯。😊，Yes。So okay。

 so let's bring it now to needs， you see。What if you had a need that you could say to your partner about conflict or about anything？

What could you tell her， what would be important for you to tell your partner？You know。

 because you grew up in a family there was conflict between your parents that that was very hard for you。

 you know， for so many reasons that we can't go into everything here。那因为你成长在一个充满冲突的家庭。那在这样的基础之上呢。

如果当你面对着你的太太，你想要告诉他你的一个重要的需求，那么这会是什么呢？So we could do a lot of work around your family， your mother。

 your father， but basically it comes to you as an adult。

 what would you say are your needs as an adult man？我们当然可以 sayI need。Calmness， I need。Gentleness。

 what， what could you say， What could you say about yourself？那关于你自己你想说的是我需要的是。我的我是一个。嗯，比较呃比较温和的人。

我也希望被温和的对待。我希望被伴侣认可和肯定。嗯，还有一种被需要的感觉。I'm a really gentle person。 I want to be treated gently。

 I need your acments。 Yes， beautiful I need your。I need your respect。我需要你的尊重。Now。

 if you want to make it stronger， I think it's really important to say I come from a family where I saw a lot of conflict。

我们可以让让这个表单更有利一点。And because of that I as a man now need see if you put those two pieces together it's very impactful so you acknowledge your family but you don't get stuck there see以得更有力一点我们可以说我来自于一个充满冲突的家庭所以我需要把后面的部分再加上但我们这两者都能融合在一的我们既能认可自己的原生家庭又能表达自己的需求 because when you can do that and I'm going to ask you to do it with me you honor the child in you and you also the man。

这个时候我们就既能荣耀内在的孩子，又能荣耀自己作为一个男人的身份，我们来一起做。Now let's do that I come from a family where I saw a lot of conflict and it hurt me。

我来自于一个充满冲突的家庭，非常的受伤那这句话继续荣耀内在的孩子之后再加上。但作为一个男人呢，我需要。让我们试一下。我来自一个充满冲突的家庭。我。深深的不想。在重复那样的冲突。我希望自己的家庭是和谐。

我希望被肯定。被认可。I'd want to repeat my family。I want a harmonious family。 I want to be recognized。

 acknowledged。😔，Right， and what's important is。Do you feel safe in your marriage to express your needs and your boundaries because that's where it has to go can you can you say to。

I also want to talk about what I lead。你是否觉得在你的关系当中呃，你感受到足够安全，能够去表达自己的需求呢？这个才是非常重要的。he said。

I don't feel safe。 express that。那 maybe you aren't safe， maybe you aren't safe。

So and I don't know enough about you， so what would you need to feel safe in order to feel safe。

 what would you need？Because I believe that you don't feel safe and you didn't feel safe as a child either。

在你童年的时候，也没有这样的安全感。那为了在现在的关系当中感受足够安全，你需要向你的伴侣表达的是。So let's start with something simple。

 I need to feel safe in my marriage， I need to feel safe。If I want to open up my heart。

 I need to feel safe让我们从这个简单的开始吧。如果你想让我打开我的心，我需要感觉安全才行。如果你需要我打开我的心，我需要我安全才行。Good， that's good。

 isn't it， doesn't that feel good。很好感觉好吗？😔，经好多了。So much better now。That feels really good， you see。

 because you ordereded your family， you see how you got what happened in the family。

And how it affected you。那当我们能够这样诚实的去看见自己原生家庭，对自己影响的时候。

And I think this is a very important piece that I need to feel safe， if I want to open up my heart。

 I need to feel safe这一点非常的重要啊，如果我要打开自己，我要感受安全。嗯。So tell me one thing that you need so that you feel safe。

 just even one thing I feel safe when。你跟我聊一聊。😔，有哪一样东西一样就可以让你感觉到安全。在什么情况下，你会觉得安全。和谐。

When there is a harmony。在家庭氛围很和谐的情况下，我觉得很安全。When the atmosphere in the family is harmonious。

 I feel safe。Good。If you can you imagine that your wife would understand that。

 even if you can't say it， do you think she could understand that。

 she could understand that you had such a fmin？你觉得如果你不说这些话的话，你的太太能理解吗？是否能理解你原生家庭的情况，你现在来感受。不一定理解。

因为我也是老师刚才问了之后。我才挖掘到我父亲那一部分。对我的印响。Maybe not， because I just。😔。

Realized how my father affected me by your question。Right， right strongly it very strongly， you know。

 you you're a very sensitive man and I'm sure that your partner could appreciate that I don't know what her wounds are I don't know what her family is。

Do you want to say， I don't know if you even want to talk about your partner。

 but it seems to me that you have the possibility， if you can have a safe space to express yourself to her。

 she could understand why you need calmness and why you need harmony。那你的父亲对理响非常的大啊。

那我不知道你的太太他的原生家庭和他们他的伤痛。那你觉得有没有这个可能呢？就是如果你向他去表达你的这一份呃需求，他能够去理解你为什么需要被温柔的对待，为什么需要和谐的家庭，他能理解吗？我我相信我如果说了。

他应该能理解。I think she probably could understand if I say this to her。😔，I think so。I think so。

I think so and you know it's okay to say I need to speak to you。

 but I need you to be very gentle with me that's a very hard thing to ask for。

But it's important to say I need you to be very gentle with me我也这样认为，那么你可以告诉他。我需要你对我非常的温柔，我想对你说一些话。

 You know， when two people get together， it's so important that each part of the couple understands the family。

 history of each other， because then you know what made you so the way you are。那在一段关系当中啊，有一个非常重要的部分。

就是双方需要去了解对方家庭的历史。这样的话我们才能知道是怎样的家庭造就了现在的你。So how do you feel right now？现在你感觉如何？我觉得我认识到了这一部分。

我以前可能对妻子的那一边的情况相对来说是了解的多一点，他可能不太不是特别了解我们这边的情况。Now I come to realize this fact。

 maybe I I understand my wife a little bit better than she understands me I need to my feelings to her tell her your story she what happened。

Now part of being intimate is that you know your partner's story and their history and they know yours那亲密关系的很重要的一部分就是两个都需要去了解对方的故事 then we can be more respectful to each other这样的话我们就能够更好的尊重对方了。

Okay。Thank you， Cherry。I mean， we could do much more， but this is a good start。那当然我们还有很多的工作是可以做的。

在这里呢，在这里现在这个状态是一个很好的开始了。已经 just just one more thing before I let you go。 You know。

 one of the things that we do when we were when we had a trauma as a child and when you see your parents in。

😊，Disarmony， it's pretty traumatic。那在我们童年的时候啊，当我们呃在一个创伤里面，或者看到父母之间的这种不和谐的时候，是非常受伤的。

Often because we couldn't resolve the trauma in the family， it was not possible we're a child。

 they're adults。😔，但往往啊在原生家庭之中，我们是无法去疗愈自己的创伤的。那时候我们还是个孩子，他们已经是成年人了。

We often create adult relationships where we recreate that trauma so that we have a better chance to heal it但之后呢在我们成年之后。

我们就会去再一次重现自己原生家庭的场景，为的就是给自己二次的疗愈机会。And therefore we have to work with that， we have to talk about。

 you know this is how my trauma was from my family。

 this is how my trauma is now and I want to change that。那么这个情况呢，就需要我们更好的去表达自己童年的经历和故事。这样的话我对方就知道哦。

我需要疗愈的是这个部分。And I really wish you luck。我祝愿你我祝愿你能够幸运。😔。

Thank you for your sensitivity and your openness。感谢你这种非常敏感的心，以及非常敞开的勇气。谢谢老师。Thank you， my teacher。

So let's take our 10 minutes break now。Around we come back。We'll do Q&A， okay。11点04分回来做问答，10分钟休息一下。

We'll take a 10 minutes break now I said okay Alice and then we'll do Q&A all right well that。

那我们现在休息1分钟啊 so I'm going to start with some of the questions on my list because they're really great questions and then if we have time we'll take participants questions。

嗯，那我们现在呢就从我收到的这些问题开始解答。如果还有时间的话，我就现场再选几位同学提问好吗？Gted。And just tell Sherry to。

Did she just answer me Okay， yeah。This okay got it all right fine so now I know what to do Okay so i'm going to take the questions that were sent to me the first question is what kind of needs can be satisfied by ourselves and what kind in an intimate relationship。

第一个问题就是什么需求应该是自给自足的，什么需求是需要通过伴侣关系来满足的。And then the question says， if we can satisfy all our needs。

 why do we need an intimate relationship那这个问题中说啊，如果我们所有的期待所有的需求都能自己满足的话，为什么要还要关系干嘛呢？All right。

You know， an intimate relationship is about being intimate。

 it's not only about getting your needs Nancy。那大家要知道啊，亲密关系的核心是亲密，而并不仅仅是满足自己的需求。

An intimate relationship is about sharing yourself， your energy， your intelligence， your your dreams。

 your。Your heart， it's about sharing。 It's not about getting the亲密关系呢它是围绕分享来建立的，分享你的心，分享你的情感，你的梦想。

你的生命力。 Now， it is also about giving and receiving love。 So if we have a need for love。

 then the relationship satisfies that。But we cannot come to a relationship。Like a hungry child。

That's what you call your child needs。Cannot be satisfied in an adult relationship。Hard。

 but it's true。Your child needs have to be healed through looking at your family of origin。那么亲密关系啊。

当然也包含着爱与被爱的关系。所以当你有爱的需求的时候，自然而然也会得到满足。不过呢当你呃成为一个如饥似渴的孩子，带着这样的状态走进亲密关系的时候，你是不会得到满足的。

我们的亲密关系需要发生在一段成年人的关系当中。我们童年的创伤，需要透过去观察，去疗愈自己的原生家庭，才能够做的。

So what this means is you don't deny your childhood， like the work with Jerry。

 you take your childhood into your adult relationship。

 but you don't let it run your adult relationship see，也就是说啊我们不能够去否认自己童年的创伤但是我们也不能够让他去主宰我们的生命和关系。

就像刚才 Jerry的个案当中展示的那样。You come into your relationship you say， this was my childhood。

 this is what happened。But I'm not that child anymore。 see我们在关系当中会说，这是我的童年，这是我过去发生的事情。但是我已经不再是那个孩子了。

So healing your childhood is acknowledging your childhood， this was my childhood。

 that was my parents， this is what I got， this is what I didn't get， that's the fact。疗于童年。

首先从承认自己的原生家庭开始，这是我的父亲，这是我的母亲，这是我所经历的这是我得到的这是我缺失的。 And tomorrow I'm going to talk about how do we bring to a partner。

 Our needs and boundaries in a relationship， That's our work for tomorrow。那明天我们将讲讲在一段关系当中。

我们如何带入自己的需求和界限。 next question I worked on already。 what's the difference between boundaries and selfdef。

嗯。那么另外一个问题啊，我已经看了一下，也就是说怎样区分健康的界线和呃不健康的过度的防御这两者之间的差别。 When you have selfdefense。

 you cannot let somebody in。 you cannot this movement that we've been doing， you cannot have。

 if you only have walls。 So if you feel that there's exchange of energy and exchange of。And。

You expressing yourself， you're talking about your feelings， then you don't have walls。

 you have walls when you you cannot make real contact。当我们过度防御的时候啊，我们感受到的是一堵很厚的墙，在我们与他人中间隔离开来。

我们感受不到与对方的交互，我们也无法自行的表达。那当我们能感受到这个情感的流动的时候啊，它就是一个健康的界限，反之则不是 Some boundaries are healthy。

 But actually， I want to talk about that tomorrow。 What does good boundaries in a relationship look like because there's internal and external boundaries。

 but I'll talk about that。 That's my theme for tomorrow。那明天呢我将跟大家聊一聊健康的界限是怎样的那当然这个界限分内在的和外在的。

这是我明天的主题了。My next question， someone says， I always wanted to find love and get married。

 but I've never been able to get into a relationship， what must I do？有一个同学问啊，我一直很想顺利的恋爱结婚。

但是一直没有走进恋爱关系，该怎么办呢？It's a wonderful question。Well， the first thing we would say is。

What stops you is it that you don't have confidence。

Is it that you're waiting for somebody to come to you？首先我们要问的一个问题是啊，是什么阻碍了你，你是没有自信吗？还是在一直等待别人靠近你呢？

 you know， in order to have a relationship， we have to heal a little bit of our shame。

 because if we don't have our shame， if we don't heal our shame。那为了要拥有一段关系，我们首先要需要疗愈自己的羞耻感。

因为啊如果我们不疗愈这个羞耻感的话。We don't feel that we deserve to be loved we carry this。

Shame around us that says you are not lovable and you don't deserve to be loved。

 And that stops us without our knowing。 that stops us from actually finding a person to be close。

 It's the shame that stands in the way。若我们不去疗愈自己的羞耻感的话，我们就会觉得自己不配被哀，不值得被哀。我们就会携带着这份羞耻感。呃，在生活当中。

他一直阻碍着我们走进一段关系里。这个羞耻感会成为我们呃接受爱得到爱的障碍。 Now shame is not something we are conscious of it is this thing that is like。

It's an invisible force that's like stands in your way of doing what you want and being what you want。

那么羞耻感呢，他很多时候是不被我们觉察的，他有一点像是这种不可见的力量一样，他阻碍着我们去做想做的事，成为想成为的自己。

 and every time we in our families did not get seen or loved。Or respected。对。每一次我们在家庭当中没有被看见。

没有被尊重和爱的时候。It translates in our understanding of ourselves as I am not worthy。

 I am not good enough to be loved。都会在我们的内在被翻译成我是不值得的，我是不配拥有爱的。This is natural， a child。

When it doesn't get loved or doesn't get。Its needs met。

 it interprets it is I didn't get what I needed because I'm not worthy。

 that's the way a child's mind works。当一个孩子的需求没有被满足，或者他想得到的爱没有得到的时候，他的诠释就是我是不值得，我是不配的的。So deep down。

 when we start to work with our needs and we start to acknowledge our needs and express our needs actually at the same time。

 we are working with our shame So either you first work with your shame and you get to your needs or you work with your needs and you heal your shame but they go together shame and needs go together我们的羞耻感跟需求两者是相辅相成互相影响的。

当我们能够深深的去看见自己的需求并认可它我们已经开始在疗愈自己的羞耻感。所以这条路是双向的，我们可以经由需求去疗愈自己的羞耻感，也可以先疗愈羞耻感，再走进需求。

So this question is really good， it's a really deep question because ultimately。

Healing our family of origin and working with our needs and boundaries is working with our shame。

所以这个问题也是非常深刻的。因为去呃疗愈自己的原生家庭，或者说就自己的需求和界限进行工作，都是在疗愈我们的羞耻感。

And the other way shame works is when we have shame that is unhealed。

 which means we don't know about it， we keep recreating the same trauma again and again。那修耻感还有一个特点。

当一个羞耻简羞耻感啊，他未被觉察和看见，也就是未被疗愈的时候，他就将一次一次的去重复去创造，再呃让你去感受到修耻的场景。You see， this is how it works。

 whatever is not healed， keeps repeating until we start to really deal with it properly。

所有未被疗愈的一切都会不断的重复出现，一直带到你能够正式的面对他去对待他疗愈他为止。U。Okay， if a marriage must end。

 how do I make my child feel safe and secure and minimize the damage of divorce on him？Good question。

嗯，如果一段婚姻必须结束，我要怎么建立孩子的安全感，把对孩子的伤害程度降到最低。很好的问题。You know。

 I think this is a great question because sometimes we try to protect children by not telling them the truth。

有的时候呢我们会啊去向孩子隐瞒离婚这个事实，以便于来保护他。And children see things they feel things。

 so it's really you don't have to tell the child all the details it's not their business。

 but you can tell the child mommy and daddy are not getting on so well。

 so we have decided to be separate。那么孩子他是能够感受到，也能够去看见的。虽然你不需要去向他坦白所有的细节，但是你可以告诉他妈妈和爸爸相处的不是很好。

所以我们决定先分开一段时间。Now it's also important to tell a child it's not your fault。

 you were a beautiful child。Mommy and daddy just had problems。

 It's not your fault because children take everything personally。

 They feel everything is their fault。非常重要的是啊，你们需要告诉孩子，这不是你的错，这是爸爸和妈妈两个人的之间的事情。呃，你是呃没有任何关于你的这个错误啊。

因为如果你不告诉他的话，孩子他会把所有的责任都拦在自己的身上。 Now， the most important thing is not to make the child choose between mother and father。

 because sometimes when there's a separation or divorce。

 The one parent talks bad about the other parent and splits the child。To make a choice。

 mommy or daddy， that must not happen。 That's terrible for a child。而最重要的是你不需要你一定不要让孩子去在你们两个中间选择一个。

很多时候，当离婚发生的时候，父母啊会去强迫孩子去选择其中一方。这个对孩子来说是一种撕裂的痛苦。So you have to say to the child。

 Mommy and daddy both love you， you will always have mommy and you will always have daddy。

So will not lose mommy or daddy。你会告诉他，爸爸和妈妈都很爱你，你永远都会有爸爸，永远都会有妈妈，你永远都不会失去我们。

 and you will always be our priority。 That's the most important thing。而最重要的是最重要的是你要告诉他啊。

你永远都将是我们两个最重要的。That's a good question。 Okay， so here's another1。 I think this is really good。

 My mother has many expectations and needs on me。 It feels like she's putting her whole life on me。

 and it is too heavy for me， How do I get rid of this burden？有一个问题非常的好啊。他提到母亲对我有很多期待，很多要求。

好像要把他的生命整个人生寄托在我这里，我的负担很重，怎么摆脱心理负担呢。Unfortunately， this is quite common in the family system。

In China and。I think it's so important to realize that loving your mother and respecting your mother doesn't mean that you need to be boundaryless。

不幸的是，这在中国的家庭系统当中非常常见。这个时候我们需要意识到，爱和尊重你的母亲并不意味着你需要毫无界限。 And it's very important to say， mother。

 I love you。 I respect you。 I will always be there for you， but I also need to have my own life。

这个时候重要的是，我们要对母亲说，妈妈，我很爱你，很尊重你，我永远都会在那里。当你需要我的时候，但是我也需要有自己的人生。 And you know， mostly。

 I think the mother understands that。你知道吗？我觉得大部分的情况下母亲都会理解的。So if you can be centered。

If you can be loving。Respectful， which you must be with your mother。You can also have good。

 clear boundaries。若你能够非常忠正，并且带带着爱和尊重面对你母亲的话，那么你就会拥有一个非常好的界限。And you can be clear this I can do。

 this I cannot do。你就能够清晰的去告诉他，这个我能够做那个不能。And it's very important when you set your boundaries to stay with your boundaries。

呃，而且重要的是啊，当你画下了界线，就需要去保持自己的界限。Because what happens when often when we give our parents a boundary。

 we feel so much guilt and so much pain that the next day we say， oh， don't worry， don't worry。

 I will do whatever you want and we collapse and that's not good。😊，很多时候，当我们一旦与父母划清了一些界线。

我们内在会有非常多的负疚感和痛苦。然后第二天我们就会说哎呀算了吧，就忘记那个吧，这样的话我们就更加的崩溃了。

It's very important when you set a boundary that you stay with that boundary。

 you don't give it away again，所以一旦我们画下了界限，就需要去坚持自己的界线，不要轻易的放弃，这个非常重要。Okay。Heres another way。

I left my last relationship because of my partner's betrayal。After that， I became scared of。

The opposite sex。 And now I cannot get close to them。 That's a good question。嗯。

有一个很好的问题说我上一段关系的结束是因为先生出轨了，但现在呢我非常的害怕异性。Okay takes， it's a great question， you know。

 many times when we've been really hurt and really betrayed。😊，You know， we want to protect ourselves。

呃，这是一个很好的问题啊。当我们感觉到自己非常受伤的时候呢，我们呃就需要就一种需求想要去保护自己。And for a time。

 it's good to protect oneself and not immediately go in another relationship在一段关系之内好好的保护自己。

不急于进入另一段关系是对的。But it's important to understand why that betrayal happened。

 what happened in that old relationship， what mistakes were made。但重要的是，我们需要去了解在上一段关系发生了什么，为什么会有出轨发生。

What was your partner's part in it， What was your part in it那在这个故事当中，你的先生他扮演着怎样的角色，而你的部分又是什么？

When relationships end， it's a fantastic time to look at yourself and grow and change because every relationship teaches us something。

每一段关系的结束对我们来说都是一个绝好的自我观察，自我学习的时机。因为每一个关系它都带有着呃。对我们来说非常有意义的功课 and many people never overcome a breakup。

 They stay locked and stuck in that breakup。 So it's important to learn your lessons。

 What did that breakup teach me about love， about myself， about needs， about boundaries。

那很多人呢他都无法从某一段关系的结束当中走出来。他一直卡在那里。所以在这个时候我们需要去观察这个关系，这个结束他教导了我们什么？关于爱的关于自己关于接闲于需求。

 And then it's exciting to have a new relationship because you can say。

 I don't want to do the same that I did before， I want to do something new， something different。

那当你能够把这一个部分了解清楚之后，你就会非常兴奋的准备好进入到下一个关系里了。这个时候你就可以清楚的知道，我不想再重复过去的模式，我想做一些新的东西。Here's a great one。

 I have mentally accepted the fact that my husband had affairs。

But my body kept rejecting him for intimate contact and it's been like this for many years now。

有一个非常好的问题啊，这个问题说，我在理智上接纳了老公的出轨，可是身体却一直抗拒和老公亲密，已经有很多年了，是处于这种卡着的状态。You know。

 this is a great question because your body has a deep wisdom， your body is saying。

 I cannot open to somebody who mistreats me， who's cheating on me。这是一个很好的问题啊，因为你的身体拥有着巨大的智慧。

你的身体似乎在告诉着你，我不想去接纳这个欺骗着我或者对我不好的人。Your body's very intelligent your body has a wisdom your body has a boundary it says if you're going to cheat and be with someone else I don't want to be with you so that's a way of respecting yourself so I would say。

Let me trust my body， my body is clear。所以实际上你的身体是非常有智慧的。就好像他说呃如果你要出轨的话，如果你要欺骗我的话，我是不想接受你的。所以在这样的情况下。

我想说的是去信任你的身体吧。其这其实上是对自己的一种尊重。So， you know， this is a wonderful place where two people really need to talk about what's happening。

Iち。real communication嗯，那这实际上也是尊重自己身体带给自己的一种界限。那在这个情况下啊，是两个人去沟通很好的时机。但我看着这个提问的状态，似乎两个人之间没有充分的沟通。So。

The big question is what would I need to say and what would I need to ask。

 what would I want to ask myCar？所以在这里我们需要思考的一个问题，就是我能够跟他说的是什么，或者说有哪一些诉求是我需要跟他提出的。

And if I can't talk to my partner about my needs and boundaries， what can I find out？By myself。

 it's a great time to look at yourself and ask yourself， what do I need in this relationship。

 what are my boundaries and what must I do？若你不能够很好的跟自己的先生去表达自己的这份需求的话，你也可以借这个时机好好的自我观察。

去好好的自我问询我的需求是什么，我的界限是什么？这个时候我应该做的是什么？嗯。Here's a good one， why am I always attracted to married men？

这里有一个很好玩的问题啊，小明说着我总是会被已婚男性吸引，为什么呢？Now this is a complicated question。

 on the one hand is a simple answer， well if you relate if you really want to be with married men。

 then you're not really ready for a real relationship because what can you have with a married man only a little bit？

那么这是一个非常复杂的问题啊。不过有一个答案似乎可以回答你这个答案就是如果你总是被已婚的男士吸引的话，那么说明你没有真正的准备好接那一段关系。与一个已婚的男人能有怎样的深度关系呢？仅仅是很表浅的一点。

不是吗？But on a deeper level， this can also mean。Am I still trying to get my father's love because often？

When we attract it to married men， it reflects the triangle in the marriage between your mother。

 your father and yourself。But that may be a bit too complicated for now。嗯，在一个更新的层面啊。

它也许显示着实际上你是在呼唤着父亲的爱。因为这种跟已婚已婚男人的这种三角的恋情，他影射的是父亲、母亲和你之间的这种关系。

So I hope that's good some things to think about we have a half an hour left and I would like to take Q&A from the people in the workshop now so。

And maybe manage a few people， so if you want to ask a question， please。

icecho people for好那我们现在还有30分钟的时间啊，30分钟的时间呢去选择一些现场的问题来答疑请田园帮我们选择几个问题。do I have some people好的。

那我们第一位请五班的周博。Hi， Sharon， please ship the speakers for you。Speak of you， okay， sure。

 but I'm on speak of you。I see herYes， I see her clearly， I don't speak hi。😊，嗯，是这样子的，我有一个问题，我。哦。

我最近我今年结束了我21年的婚姻。但是当我想象我要进入一段新的关系的时候，会发现。我好像没有办法相信我是悲爱的。然后今天在练习里面，老师让我们做一个给予的那个，我会和你分享爱。

我当时就觉得我手里有个很很沉重的羞愧。我好像觉得我好像不配不配合别人去分享。rry I'm getting cells完整清楚了让我翻一下H Sharon。

 I just ended my 20 year marriage this year。I realized it's difficult for me to trust that I deserve to be loved。

 and when I open my hand to give love in the practice， I could feel the reserve。😔，Heavy shameness。

 the sense of shame in my hand。嗯。我非常抱歉，因为我刚我现在在机场，刚刚那个广播已经强到了。

I apologize for the noises for I'm in the airport。嗯。U。Okay。Let me think about it you know。

 it's important to take some time to heal yourself because probably the shame comes from the family it's not you know we carry the shame but the shame belongs to the family system。

嗯，我觉得你需要一段时间来疗愈自己，我们都会携带着来自于原生家庭的这一份羞耻感。但你需要知道这一份羞耻感是被你携带的，但是它却不属于你它属于你的原生家庭。

 It's so important that you see when we born a little baby。 It doesn't have shame。

 We learn shame in the family。当你还是一个出生婴儿的时候，你不会有任何的羞耻感。所有的羞耻感是我们在原生家庭当中习得的。

And it's really good to explore your shame so you don't carry that shame into the next relationship。

应应该好好的去探索一下你的羞耻感，这样的话你就不会无意识的把它带进你的下一段关系里。And we really start to heal our shame when we look at our needs and our boundaries。

 that's really what shame is is bad， no needs and bad boundaries， that's shame。

若能若我能好好的去观察并且认可自己的需求和界限的时候，我们就能够去转化自己的羞耻感。什么是真正的羞耻感呢？就是没有需求，没有界限。 So when you could start even small。

 what do I need。What I what I I not willing to compromise see because when we have shame。

 we make compromise after compromise and we end up feeling more and more unworthy。

 So some compromise in a relationship is good but not too much not give yourself away。

所以这个时候呢我们可以从一点点的改变来开始，也就是去感受一下我的需求是什么？我不愿意妥协的东西是什么？若我们有一种羞耻感的话，我们会在婚姻当中一再的妥协，直到自己感觉到不值得不配的。

所以这个时候去感受你不愿意妥协的需求有哪些？Okay。It would be good to get some support right now so you can get support to find out what do I need now I don't want to repeat a shame relationship。

 what do I need for myself。在这个时候呢，你需要得到一些支持，呃，通过他人的支持去好好的感受一下我需我的需求是什么。这样的话你就不会再去重复一段充满羞耻感的关系了。

 So take some time now alone to really deepen your healing。

 And I think all what we're doing in this workshop is very， very good for healing your shame。

所以你可以花一段时间啊去加深你对自己的疗愈。我们在这个工作坊当中所做的所有的事情，对于疗愈都是非常有益处的。And I look at you。 I see a beautiful woman。

 You， you can， you can do it。 You can do it。 You have to work through your family stuff。

 What shame did I get in my family。我我看着你的我看着你的时候，我看到的是一个非常美丽的女子，你是可以做到的。你可以去感受一下，看着你的原生家庭。

究竟我的羞耻感是来自于哪一个部分？😊，ok好吗？Good work， good lucker Thank you， Sharon Shea， you're welcome。好的。

那我们下一位请一班的韩语。hello ，你好。老师好，嗯，我想向老师提问一个问题，就是。嗯，我家里面有三个孩子嘛，我有一个哥哥，还有一个弟弟，我在家里面是最受宠爱的孩子。

但是不知道为什么我还是有很严重的遗器创伤，在亲密关系里面是属于依赖者的那个角色。所以想啊老师帮我解答一下这个问题。我先搬啊谢 Actually。

 I am in the family of three kids。 I'm the middle one。

 a younger brother and older brother actually de me a lot。

 but I found I have a really severe trauma of abandonment。 And I'm this type dependent type。

 So why it is happening like so。😊，Do you know where your abandonment comes from？你是否知道一器创伤来自于哪里呢？

Can you connect to anything？你能够连接到一些与此相关的经历吗？相关的经历吗？嗯，就是我想到我从小到大，我一直害怕失去我的妈妈，然后她外出的时候，我总是不放心。

或者是我也曾经梦到好几次都梦到过他离开我或者是去世之类。然后在梦中会哭着醒来被吓死的那种状态。One thing that I'm sure that I'm really。

 I was really afraid of losing my mother。I would be really panic pan panic when she was on her business trip。

 I had many nightmares about losing her。So did she go on a lot of business trips？他会经常出差吗？他会经常出差吗？呃。

也没有，就是小时候我们也是生活在一起的。Not really we were living together all the time together all the time right I don't I'm not quite sure where your fear of abandonment comes from。

嗯，我不是特别确定你的这种一器创伤来自于哪里。Did your mother show you love， was she very close to you？你的母亲他会向你表达他对你的爱吗？

他跟你会非常亲密吗？呃，小时候的话他给很多爱，但是我就觉得他管的很严格，然后他会跟爸爸吵架，然后有好多的抱怨。然后就很害怕他们会分开。呃，还有一点就是妈妈在我小的时候，他身体不是很好，然后会经常生病。

这样。m嗯。My mother was not in a good health condition when I was little and she was。

 she would be quarrelling with my dad。 I was afraid of。They were they would be separate。Okay。

 now I understand so we would call that insecurity a lack of stability。

 so the the fear was that the love could disappear at any moment。嗯，那实际上呢这个他更多的是叫做不安全感。

所以你害怕的是一种不稳定的感觉。你可能会觉得这一份爱好像随时会失去。It's a little bit different than abandonment， but not so different。

 it's more instability。实际上跟这种一气创伤是不太一样的，呃，但是差别也不是非常的大，都是有一种不稳定的感觉。No。

 and that creates a very deep fear because。You can't trust， you don't feel safe。他会创造非常深刻的恐惧。

因为你会觉得自己无法信任，觉得自己不够安全。And you saw your parents have conflict。而且你经常看到你的父母之间有有冲突，对吗？s right是吗？

So when a child sees parents with conflict， it's terrifying。

 it makes the child so afraid because there's no stability。那当一个孩子看到父母之间要冲突的时候，他是会非常恐惧的。他会觉得一切都是不安定的。

So if you understand that you're needing to hold someone is so that you feel secure。

Then you can have more kindness for yourself and you can explain to the people in your life。

I had a lot of instability in my family and I am very afraid。如果你能够看到啊自己对于这种稳定感的需求，或者喜欢抓取别人的这种习惯。

是有自己的原生家庭的原因的话，你就能够对自己有更多的同理心，给自己更多的空间，也就能够跟身边的人去解释。我小的时候有一个非常动荡的家庭氛围。所以我需要更多的安定感。Yes。

 there's a lot of fear in the system when you don't know what's going to be。

 it's very deep what you say。那这样的家庭系统啊会充斥着非常多的恐惧感。所以你所表达的这个部分是非常深刻的。So。

There's nothing really to do about it， it's about understanding yourself， accepting yourself。

 being friendly to yourself， don't judge yourself that that really doesn't help。

那在这里呢我们需要做的就是首先要去了解你自己，去跟你自己做朋友，去体谅你自己，不要去评判自己。I mean， I could say more。

 but I think that's a good start当然还有非常多的方法，但是在这里呢用这样的方式来开始就足够好了。Okay， thank you， Sha。 thank you。

 Thank you。Thankk you。 You're doing fine， actually，你做的非常好了，已经。😊，好的，那我们下一位请二班的夏风。Hello。你好哎你好，谢谢给我这个机会。

呃，我刚才听到老师讲呃依赖性人格跟反依赖型人格，我没有听得太清楚，我自己可能会属于什么样呃呃依赖型人格还是比如说呃我现在的状态就是我一个人的时候觉得挺舒服的。但是呢嗯就会在要求那个伴侣的时候呢。

嗯也会很很焦虑。我我就不太清楚。就比如说我在原来在家里是最小的一个孩子，有上面有两个哥哥。然后相当于是比较忽，第一是比较忽视的状态。然后呢也比较认可。然后我就不太清楚这个我想呃更加了解一下这部分。

I actually really enjoy being alone， while sometimes I anxiously control my partner。

You were talking about dependent and undepend。To which catalog do I belong。

 I'm a little bit confused Im in my family of arranging I'm the youngest I have two brothers。

 I sometimes am' being neglected， but despair spoil me a lot also I think you're healthy。

 I think we all have a little bit of dependent， a little bit of antidepend and it flows。我觉得你是非常坚定的。

So to me， you look quite healthy， quite normal。我觉得你看起来非常的健康啊。因为我们每个人呢都有一点依赖型人格和反依赖性人格。

这两种人格状态在我们的生命里是切换和流动的。This is what I want to talk about tomorrow we have both we have inside us dependent and antidepend。

 but some part of us。iss more conscious of the dependent and less conscious of the antidepend but a balanced person has both那么这也是明天我想讲的话题。

也就是我们每一个人的内在同时有依赖和反依赖这两种特质，只不过有的时候我们可能更加觉察到的是其中的一种。那么这两种啊，在健康的人的身上都是不断的变换，不断的切换的都有一点点。

And a healthy relationship moves between some days you're dependent。

 some days you're antidepend and some days your partner is dependent。

 some days he's anti dependent and it goes like this。那么一个健康的亲密一个健康的亲密关系也是一样的啊。有的时候你是依赖，有的时候反依赖。

有的时候你的伴侣是依赖和反依赖的，这是非常好的。就像是一个这个八字形呃永恒的这个符号，它是不断切换和流动的。😊。

That's really good it's unhealthy when it's always stuck youre always the dependent in your partners always the antidepend and there's always conflict that's not healthy that's not good我们所说的不健康的关系就是永远是僵化在一种模式卡住在一种状态。

永远是依赖或者永远是反依赖这样呢就是不健康的关系。So you sound pretty balanced to me。我听你的描述，觉得你是很平衡的。

good family那听起来你也是家庭生活过得非常好's really great not so much problems嗯这是非常好嗯，没有太多的问题啊。😊，The work。ok。

 thank you。I take one or two more then I'm going to do a little meditation to end so let's take two more。

好，让我再回答两个问题，最后进入到冥想和静心。嗯，那我们下面请三班的宠爱。Noello。你好你好你好，老师。嗯嗯谢谢这个慧珍给我这样一个机会啊。嗯，我想问一个问题，就是在亲密关系当中，嗯。

我有的时候总是不自觉的去把老公的感受和情绪呃凌驾于我之上。有的时候总是想不自觉的做一些事情来满足他，让他认可我来获得他对我的爱。这一点我有点苦，有点有点不舒服。但是我有的时候还是不自觉的去这样做。

有的时候认为自己不够好。觉得自己好像不值得呃，他说他爱我，感觉自己好像在不自信，就觉得自己好像不值得他那么爱我有这种感觉。我想问老师怎么办 I addition my question is。

 in my intimate relationship， always take the feelings and emotions So my husband as priorityity in the cost of neglecting my own。

 and I always please him and I want to do something to make myself to be of his love。

 And sometimes I don't feel I deserve his love。 What do I do。Well， that's big， okay。

 let me think about it， you know， you see it very clearly。

 you see how you minimize your needs and you make his needs more important。你看的实际上非常的清楚。

你看到你把自己的需求啊感受降到最低，去把他的当成是最重要的。And that's the definition of a dependent。

 a dependent always makes the other person more important。

 they make them big and we make ourselves small。It comes from shame， you see。那这个就是一个依赖者的状态。一个依赖者呢。

他就会让自己变得卑微渺小，去更加重视其他人的需求和感受。实际上这一切都是源于一种羞耻感。So there's a pattern。

 there's a pattern of minimizing yourself， making yourself small。

 which is very much a dependent structure， that's what dependents do。那么实际上这是你的一个习惯性的模式啊。

也就是呃去降低自己的需求和感受，这是一个依赖依赖者的状态。And one of the big fears of the dependent is if we as dependents start to change things and give more space for our needs。

 will that end the relationship will the partner leave。

 that's always the fear if I do something different， the relationship crashes。那么依赖者他一直会有这样的一个恐惧。

也就是如果我满足了自己的需求，或者给自己更多空间的话，我的亲密关系会结束吗？And that may happen， I don't think so but。

Sometimes a relationship to be healthy needs to be balanced。也许这样的情况会发生，但是我想说的是，一个健康的关系，需要一个平衡的状态才行。

So one thing you can start is to。Take a little bit more。Space for your needs。

 it's not changing everything， it's just。Small steps， see。那么你现在可以做的是给自己的需求和感受更多的空间，并不是说去改变一切。

仅仅是做出一小步的改变。And it might be helpful if you have a partner you can talk to， I don't know。呃。

如果你有一个人啊能够去聆听，或者说你的伴侣，能够去聆听你的需求的话，这是非常好的。但我不知道是不是这样的情况。To explain to your partner。

I am now becoming aware of a pattern in our relationship。你可以跟你的伴侣啊倾诉一下，说我觉察到了我们的关系有一种模式。

It's not blaming him or blaming yourself it's we have a pattern and I would like to change that pattern just a little bit。

但这并不是说去责备自己或责备他，仅仅是告诉他，我们有这样一个模式，我想要尝试去改变。And I think you have the possibility。

 you have the intelligence， you have the mental clarity to say I need a little bit more space for me in our relationship I don't want to end the relationship but I want to。

Shift it a little bit。我觉得我看到你的状态，你非常的聪慧，而且非常的清晰，你是可以做到的，可以向他清晰的表达。我希望能够有更多的空间。我并不是想结束跟你的关系。

但是我希望能够有一点自己的空间 and start with something small so you don't destabilize the relationship。

to start with something small嗯，我们可以从一点点的改变来开始，这样的话不会让关系失衡。嗯，谢谢老师，我现在正在尝试改变，感觉到表达出自己的需求之后，内心非常舒服。

也感觉到就是自己感觉自己就是爱更爱自我现在尝试一段时间但是还没有完全的做到自的受和情绪是最重要的这个这个地步，但是也在改变我对自己也很有信心。

谢老师Thank you my teacher actually I'm trying this for a while now。

 and it feels quite comfortable to express know seem like a really strong don't look like a very passive woman。

 You look like quite a strong woman to me。 so I think you can do it。😊，你看起来是很有力量的一个女子，并不是那种被动的。

所以我觉得你能做到。这个是address you我相信你。Good work谢理老也相信我自己I also trust myself。Thank you。 That's great。 Allright。

 let's take one more and then we'll do a little好再来一个之后做一个小小的精选。那请5班的袁单。😊，Hi。You。嗯。T them to unmute。

 there we go。来呃，元旦可以了可以了可以了，有点紧张，而且很惊喜。Ami little nervous， and really surprised。Okay。嗯，我现在有一个状况是。嗯。

Okay。嗯。Yeah。就是我先生在两年前。嗯。发生了出轨的事情。呃，这个事情经历了一年多，然后我是去年知道的。嗯。这个过程非常非常的艰难。Yeah。Last year。

 I found out my husband had an affair two years ago。And knowing this is quite difficult for me。😔，嗯。

No。然后。我发现嗯孩子在这里面也被卷入了很多。Our kid was inevitably involved。😔，他的身体出现了很多的状况。そ。

Our kid has been through many physical illnesses。は。嗯。嗯。嗯，那s a big one嗯。这个看起来 one child你们只有一个孩子吗？OK。嗯。

Okay， did you find out or did your husband tell you，你是自己发现他出轨的还是他告诉你的？我我发现的，I found out。很多很多的谎言。

Nualize。Yeah， yeah。Can you talk about it now？你现在能聊一聊吗？可以。嗯。我新生的外遇的对象，甚至来了两次我们家。

She came at least twice to our home。😔，Oh， that's a boundary crossing。

我这个太that is boundarythat's notO这个太跨越界限了，这个是不允许的。You know， when the boundaries are crossed like that。

It destabilizes the family， and the child feels the。The shock of the boundary crossing。

 even if the child doesn't know what's going on。当这样的家庭的界限被跨越的时候，整个家庭的氛围都会失去稳定性。即便孩子他的意识上并不知道。

但是他能够感受到这一切的不安定。So clearly。You and your husband need to red draw the boundaries。

 You have to to re set the boundaries because the boundaries are。Are not good。

 they're not good in the family system， in the home。你跟你的先生需要重 respectful to you as a woman。

你跟你的先生需要重新建立起一个稳定的家庭的界限。因为现在这一切都是不稳定的，摇摇欲坠的。呃，并且你的先生透过这样的行为，也是对你极大的不尊重。

So there are many things that you can do， but the first thing is to create a boundary。

That protects you and your child。那这个时候有很多的事情是可以做的。但首先就是你需要去创造一个保护自己和孩子的界限。是的，这个事情发生了以后。

我发现我是有力量去创造这个边界，保护我自己和孩子的。Yes after this incident I realized I actually I have the strength to reestablish the boundary to protect myself and my kid and your home。

 you know， we talked about the first boundary is your physical space， that's your home。

 that's not that's not respectful to you。而且不仅是如此啊，还要需要去保护你的家。我们也聊了界限的不同层级。第一个界限就是我们身体的界限。

那这个身体的界限也象征着我们的家。And you have the right to be safe in your own home。而且我们是有一种旋律去感受到在自己家的安全的。

 So I don't know what your relationship with your husband is like， but it's very important that。

You start by claiming back， this is my home， this is my space， and I want a boundary。我不知道你跟先生的关系是怎样。

但是首先重要的是你需要去拿回自己属于家庭的界限，这是我的家。And if he doesn't want to do it for you。

You have to tell him he must do it for his child。如果他不愿意为你去做这件事情，你就必须要告诉他你要为了孩子而做这件事情。嗯。

And then it might need a。Somebody to help you。Talk about your marriage， first of all。

 you have to talk about the boundary。That's the first step to be safe then you have to talk about so what。

 what is our marriage， what is our marriage， what does it mean to you， what does it mean to me。

那么首先呢我们需要需要去呃重新建立这个安全的界限。那么第二步就是你需要去聊一聊这一段婚姻，你可以跟他去聊一聊这个婚姻对我来说是什么。对你来说又是怎么样的？

The problem is when we have an affair in coming into a marriage。

 we focus too much on the affair person。Instead of looking at what is our marriage， what can be。

Is our marriage alive， Do we want to keep it， Do we want to let it go？Don't worry we have to do that。

嗯，当外遇出现的时候，我们往往会犯一个错误，就是把太过的关注放到这个呃出轨的这个对象的身上，而忽视了两个人之间的关系和婚姻。所以这个时候呢。

我们需要去好好的感受一下我们的这一段婚姻是想要继续还是想要去停止？And you really don't need to feel afraid that is a really。

 that is the situation that you really have to say。Not okay。而你不需要有任何的恐惧。在这样的情况下，你一定要站出来说，这是不可以的。

Do you feel you have the strength to say to your husband？I not in my physical space or。

I need to be safe。你觉得你有你觉得你是自己是否有这样的力量去告诉你的先生，你不可以去侵犯我的私密空间，或者说我的家。你觉得你可以这样做吗？No。是。Have I lost her。

你是说有这样的力量，对吗？She disappeared。the connection is not good enough。😔，I don't want to leave her that this。

嗯。😊，嗯，工作人员联系一下 see if she's receiving a chat嗯，我们工作人员试着在聊天区私聊他一下，然后问一下他是不是有力量去去做这件事情。因为老师不想在这个关键的时期结束。

 I would want to make sure that。That in the afternoon thats one of the Ts follows her through with this跟 if she works in the helps boundary for的请一位朋友去帮助他一起去创造一个健康的界限 so I Ive come my end for today。

那今天已经到结束的时候了。I wanted to do a meditation， but the questions were really important and I didn't want to hurry the people我本来想做静心的但是问题非常的重要所以我不希望够做的太匆忙。

So tomorrow we're going to put needs and boundaries together and talk about。How do we do this。

 what does it look like and？I'll give you some exercises and we'll do some questions and。

I hope you're learning something。那明天呢我们将把界限和需求放在一起，明天会回答一些问题，也会带大大家做一些联习。那我希望今天大家学到了一些东西。

So I want to thank you again， everybody for your。Courage and your。

Willingness to do the work and to look at yours and have a very beautiful day and I'll see you tomorrow那我先感谢大家的勇气。

以及大家想要去成长自己的这一份意愿呃，祝愿大家今天下午练习的愉快，明天再见。So就到这里了谢谢大家 everybody。谢谢大家。那在老师下。
