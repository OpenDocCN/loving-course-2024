Commanment 8„ÄÇThat shall make the sex happen„ÄÇSo in this section„ÄÇ

 we're talking about what it actually means to take the girl home and we're going to get into a lot of details on what causes this„ÄÇ

 how this usually happens and what you can do to expedite this process„ÄÇ First„ÄÇ

 a little disclaimer for 95% of youÔºå I'm preaching to the choir for the rest of you realize that if a girl says no„ÄÇ

 stop or tells you to walk awayÔºå you have to respect her wishes„ÄÇ I've never been to prison„ÄÇ

 but I imagine it's not the best place to meet your ideal girl„ÄÇ

 What you're going for is enthusiastic consent„ÄÇ that means the girl wants this as much or more than you do„ÄÇ

 and that is something that me and Derek do particularly well„ÄÇ

 So if you are getting signals that that's not the caseÔºå do not push it„ÄÇ

 you are expected to lead and you are expected to listen I'm about to go through a lot of details on how to inject sexuality„ÄÇ

 escalate physically etc ce„ÄÇ And this is one of those things that is a little bit different for every person„ÄÇ

 So I'm going to be focusing a lot on the overarching principle„ÄÇ

So you can build the details for yourself„ÄÇ If you have a particular problem in this area„ÄÇ

 This is something that we can fix hands on in a person to person scenario„ÄÇ First part„ÄÇ

 leading in small chunking„ÄÇ So throughout the interaction„ÄÇ

 You need to be constantly leading the girl„ÄÇ What does this mean„ÄÇ

 This means not sitting in one place for an extended period of time„ÄÇ

 not just standing by the bar for an extended period of time„ÄÇ

 you need to get her used to the fact that you guys are moving around„ÄÇ

 getting to know each other in different contexts„ÄÇ How does this actually work in practicality„ÄÇ

 It means at the beginningÔºå you might move her 2 feet likeÔºå ohÔºå just come over here over here„ÄÇ

 Then you might move her to the barÔºå Get a drink„ÄÇ You might move her to a couch a little further away„ÄÇ

 You might move her to the exit„ÄÇ You might move her to the dance floor„ÄÇ

 You are starting off slow to get that yes ladderÔºå and then you are increasing the amount that you are leading her around„ÄÇ

 This gets her use to you leading„ÄÇ and it makes it so that's not an abrupt thing where you are all of a sudden leading her outside the club„ÄÇ

NextÔºå physical escalation„ÄÇ Once againÔºå I'm going to give you underlying concepts„ÄÇ

 This is something where a lot of times people give very specific details„ÄÇ

 but that's not how it works in real life„ÄÇ In real lifeÔºå you make this a part of your natural style„ÄÇ

 understanding what the rules are„ÄÇ So this is the similarities of the guys I've seen that are the best at this and what their physical escalation actually looks like„ÄÇ

 Numb oneÔºå it starts earlyÔºå Why do we do thisÔºå Because it gets her used to the idea of you guys touching„ÄÇ

 There's nothing creepierÔºå Then all of a sudden touching her during the middle of the interaction when you've known her for 30 minutes„ÄÇ

 and you're just all of a sudden making this grand moveÔºå It's veryÔºå very awkward„ÄÇ Second„ÄÇ

 goes from low intensity to high intensity based on compliance„ÄÇ What this mean„ÄÇ

 You might start by a handshake playing thumb war„ÄÇ Then this gets a little bit more intense„ÄÇ

 You might hug her later on in the interactionÔºå later on in the interaction„ÄÇ you might kiss her„ÄÇ

 E cetera„ÄÇ You're not all of a sudden grabbing her hugging her„ÄÇ

You're not all of a sudden kissing her you're going from low intensity to high intensity and you are doing this based on how receptive she is So if she is less receptive to this„ÄÇ

 you do it slowerÔºå if she is more receptive to thisÔºå you do it faster once again„ÄÇ

 do not do anything things that these girlss are actually saying stop to but be aware of what she's feeling and based your speed of how fast you are going up the escalation ladder on that„ÄÇ

3„ÄÇIncreases during times of high energy„ÄÇ This means that there are natural ebbs and flows in the energy throughout the night„ÄÇ

 which I will get into laterÔºå but you want to be increasing your physical escalation during times of high energy„ÄÇ

 because this is how this naturally works in the real world during a high energy time„ÄÇ

 You might be hugging her„ÄÇ You might be lifting her up„ÄÇ You might be dancing with her„ÄÇ

 you might be kissing her during a low energy time„ÄÇ

 it makes it quite awkward if you are trying to up the physical escalation„ÄÇ

 when there's nothing going on in the interaction„ÄÇ Ner 4Ôºå Two steps forward„ÄÇ One step backwards„ÄÇ

 This makes the physical escalation more fluid„ÄÇ So you are going forwardÔºå let's say kissing her„ÄÇ

 et cetera„ÄÇ and then you are going backwards„ÄÇ being the one to stop the make out first„ÄÇ

 being the one to let go of the hug first„ÄÇ This shows you that you are not needy that you don't actually care if this works„ÄÇ

 This is all just a natural part of the interaction„ÄÇ

 and that you're not the type of guy where this never happens to you„ÄÇ

 and you have to hold on to it or else you might lose your one chance at getting a girl„ÄÇ

5 fluid and flowingÔºå appropriate to context„ÄÇ So this should be something like a lot of guys will put their hand on the back of a girl's back„ÄÇ

 and they will just leave it there all night„ÄÇ There's nothing creepier than this„ÄÇ

 What a guy does when he is in this process Natural„ÄÇ

 He might put his hands on her back for a couple seconds„ÄÇ Take it off„ÄÇ

 He might hug her for a couple of seconds and then let go„ÄÇ

 He is naturally doing this in a fluid and flowing manner„ÄÇ It is not static„ÄÇ

 He is not making one move and then thinking about what is the next move„ÄÇ

 He is just doing this all is kind of a tapestry„ÄÇ a natural part of the interaction„ÄÇ

 that is flowing with a conversation with the energy with everything else„ÄÇ And it is just in organic„ÄÇ

 free flowing part among all the other parts„ÄÇ6Ôºå build sexual tension„ÄÇ

 You'll see a lot of guys that will have these extended makeouts in the club„ÄÇ

 And you think they're doing great„ÄÇ at the end of the night„ÄÇ

 they don't actually take those girls home„ÄÇ So what is happening there„ÄÇ Well„ÄÇ

 when you are doing this physical escalation„ÄÇ You are building sexual tension„ÄÇ That's the entire„ÄÇ

Point is that you might be making out a little bit and then you stop and it builds a little bit of that sexual tension„ÄÇ

 You guys might be dancing and it might build a little bit of that sexual tension„ÄÇ

 but you have to think of sexual tension as a balloon„ÄÇ

 So you are blowing into it by escalating physically and then you are eventually building to the end of the night by letting all of the sexual attention go letting all the air out of the balloon at the middle of the night„ÄÇ

 There's nothing else to be discovered„ÄÇ There's no mystery to this at all„ÄÇ

 There's no will they won't they there's no wondering what would we be like together physically„ÄÇ

 All of that sexual attention has been let go„ÄÇ This doesn't mean don't ever make out with a girl in the club„ÄÇ

 but just be cognizant of is this particular move making there more sexual attention in the interaction or is it making less sexual attention in the interaction and that sexual attention should be building up to a point where you guys are actually honed together and you can enjoy each other's company„ÄÇ

 Next concept Energy of the interaction So in any interaction there will naturally be„ÄÇL points„ÄÇ

 there will be high points„ÄÇ And then there will be a little high spikes„ÄÇ

 So this happens in any interaction that you might have with someone„ÄÇ

 Even someone that let's say is your best friend„ÄÇ You will have parts of the conversation„ÄÇ

 where you guys are reallyÔºå really talking and getting excited and joking around„ÄÇ

 Then you have parts of the conversation that are lus where you are not talking that much where maybe you're both just looking around„ÄÇ

 you're kind of waiting for that next conversational topic and you're waiting for the energy to go back high again„ÄÇ

 Then there are a little spikes„ÄÇ Maybe you say something that she doesn't like or that's not politically correct„ÄÇ

 you say something that just spikes some sort of emotion„ÄÇ

 and then there's just a very quick spike in the energy where you guys are laughing together or arguing together and then it goes back down immediately„ÄÇ

 Why is this important because you want to be aware of this So that number one„ÄÇ

 the energy is going up throughout the night endingÔºå obviously when you pullÔºå take her home„ÄÇ

 And so tooÔºå that you know that your points of increasing leadingÔºå increasing physical escalation„ÄÇ I„ÄÇ

 let's say„ÄÇConversational topics to something a little bit more edgy„ÄÇ

 increasing anything else in the interaction should happen in those points of high energy and not low energy„ÄÇ

 Those low energy parts don't fight themÔºå don't be paranoid about them„ÄÇ

 but just realize that any sort of increase in the interaction is going to happen during those high points„ÄÇ

 nextÔºå seating the poll„ÄÇ So what does this mean this means adding in little things to the interaction so that when you guys actually go home together„ÄÇ

 it is not some huge surprise„ÄÇ So in practicalityÔºå this might mean saying something likeÔºå oh„ÄÇ

 I have the most amazing view at my hotel„ÄÇ or I know the best pizza place across town„ÄÇ or yeah„ÄÇ

 my hotel is right there and you can you point to it or sayingÔºå yeahÔºå you knowÔºå I like this club„ÄÇ

 but kind of dies down at too„ÄÇ And I kind of want to go get out of here„ÄÇ

 or we're gonna have an afterpart at my place„ÄÇ And these people are coming and we're going to be doing this„ÄÇ

 You're kind of giving her these ideas of„ÄÇüòäÔºåThis is what's happening afterwards„ÄÇ

 This is my plans afterwards„ÄÇ And if we're going home together„ÄÇ

 it's not going to be a complete surprise„ÄÇ What we're doing after is not a complete surprise„ÄÇ

 So Derek does this particularly wellÔºå or he will be constantly talking about„ÄÇ likeÔºå okay„ÄÇ

 this is what I'm doing after„ÄÇ This is what I'm doing after with you„ÄÇ

 This is what we're doing afterwards„ÄÇ So he's giving her a sense of this is the natural flow of our interaction„ÄÇ

 And this is what it's leading to„ÄÇ You wonder why someone like Drek or someone like myself„ÄÇ

 Never get a girl totally surprised when we say we're going home together„ÄÇ

 a girl is never surprised when we get home„ÄÇ And there's sex on the table„ÄÇ

 She just sort of knows implicitly or even explicitly that that is the course of the interaction„ÄÇ

 WellÔºå we're adding in these little things that make it completely obvious what we're up to„ÄÇ

 We're not trying to hide anything„ÄÇ And the girl can either be okay with that„ÄÇ or she can sayÔºå okay„ÄÇ

 that's not where I want the interaction to go„ÄÇI'm going to go back to my friends and then you have a chance to go find someone else„ÄÇ

I see a lot of guys sayÔºå wellÔºå I have the sticking point where the girl will come home with me„ÄÇ

 and then I get what's called last minute resistanceÔºå whereÔºå you knowÔºå we're making out or whatever„ÄÇ

 And then she just doesn't want to go all the way„ÄÇ WellÔºå dudeÔºå in our interactions„ÄÇ

 we almost never get that„ÄÇ In factÔºå the girl is usually the one escalating on us when we're back at the house„ÄÇ

Why is thatÔºå Because we don't try and pretend that we're something we're not„ÄÇ

 We are telling them this is the type of guy I am„ÄÇ This is what I'm looking for tonight„ÄÇ

 This is a natural course of the interaction„ÄÇ if we go home together„ÄÇObviouslyÔºå she says no„ÄÇ

 that's fine when we're home as well„ÄÇ That's fine„ÄÇ But most of the time„ÄÇ

 the girl is so explicitly aware of what is going on with us that when she comes home„ÄÇ

 she's just completely down from the beginning„ÄÇNextÔºå sexual escalation„ÄÇ

 and this also ties into why someone like Derek or someone like myself very„ÄÇ

 very rarely gets last minute resistance„ÄÇSo we are adding in little statements that number one„ÄÇ

 this is a manswoman conversationÔºå we are here for romantic purposes„ÄÇNumber two„ÄÇ

 that we are sexually attracted to her„ÄÇ and number threeÔºå that we are sexual people in general„ÄÇ

 This is called sexual escalation is also an escalation in that we are adding in little things at the beginning„ÄÇ

 escalatingÔºå and then adding in more potent things as time goes on„ÄÇThere's a couple ways to do this„ÄÇ

1 isÔºå as I saidÔºå manswo communication„ÄÇ So saying something likeÔºå ohÔºå you're very cute„ÄÇ Oh„ÄÇ

 you're the type of girl that I'm usually attracted to„ÄÇ OhÔºå well„ÄÇ

 you're not the type of girl that I'm usually attracted to„ÄÇ but for some reasonÔºå I'm drawn to you„ÄÇ

 and then escalating that and likeÔºå ohÔºå yeah„ÄÇ I think you and I would make a very good couple or what type of wedding would we be having„ÄÇ

 You're very clearly communicating that we are in a romantic situation and that that is what I am looking for„ÄÇ

Once againÔºå she can self select towards or self select away„ÄÇNext way to do this„ÄÇ

 actual sexual statements„ÄÇ So saying something likeÔºå yeahÔºå this is why I'm attracted to you„ÄÇ

 This is what makes me specifically attracted to you„ÄÇ You know„ÄÇ

 some joke about how you're attracted to her sexually„ÄÇ Some joke about what you guys would be like„ÄÇ

 sexually together„ÄÇ Some joke about what sort of sex you guys would be having„ÄÇ

 So these are little sexual statements about her and about you guys together„ÄÇ

 not necessarily like the man towoÔºå the man towo thing is just to establish that you're in a romantic interaction„ÄÇ

 These are explicitly sexual statements about you and her together what she's likeÔºå what you feel„ÄÇ

 what you're likeÔºå et cetera„ÄÇLast way to do this is just talking about sex in general„ÄÇ

 So you might talk about three sons that you've had„ÄÇ

 You might talk about other sexual experiences that you've had„ÄÇ

 You might talk about a documentary that you saw in sex„ÄÇ

 You might talk about sexual evolutionary theory„ÄÇ The point is„ÄÇ

 you are just injecting little things about sexÔºå adding sex to the conversation„ÄÇ

 And then making it not so weird when all of a suddenÔºå this is a sexual interaction„ÄÇ

 That part has already been added in„ÄÇ she's thinking about it„ÄÇ You're thinking about it„ÄÇ

 It's a natural part of the conversation„ÄÇ And so it's not some alien topic that never got breached„ÄÇ

 And then you guys go home together and you're awkwardly trying to figure out how to make this a sexual interaction„ÄÇ

 S should be a natural part of what you guys are talking about together„ÄÇ

So you want to be thinking about these four concepts throughout the interaction and when you think back on your interactions„ÄÇ

 you want to be thinking about what was happening with these four concepts„ÄÇ

 so they were physical escalationÔºå the energy of the interaction„ÄÇ

 seating the pole and sexual escalation„ÄÇNext„ÄÇTaking the girl home versus getting the number„ÄÇ

 which one should you doÔºüWellÔºå I have a very strong opinion on this„ÄÇ You should never get the number„ÄÇ

 You should neverÔºå ever get the number„ÄÇ That doesn't mean that you should be forcing taking her home„ÄÇ

 ObviouslyÔºå if that doesn't work outÔºå it doesn't work out„ÄÇ

 But I basically never get numbers from a nightclub„ÄÇ And there's a couple reasons for this„ÄÇ

 Number oneÔºå only about 15 per cent of the numbers that you getÔºå will ever convert to anything„ÄÇ

 And that is completely independent of how good the interaction went„ÄÇ A lot of guys„ÄÇ

 they will get number after number after number„ÄÇ And some of these will be really solid interactions„ÄÇ

 But they never lead to a date„ÄÇ So why is thatÔºå What's happening is that the girl is at a club„ÄÇ

 She's joking around with people drinkingÔºå partyingÔºå dancingÔºå There's all these lights„ÄÇ

 There's all this loud musicÔºå And she's in a certain mode when she is out of that mode the next day„ÄÇ

 even though she was really attracted to youÔºå really connected to you„ÄÇ

 She's no longer feeling those same emotions„ÄÇ And so she can't even really remember„ÄÇ

 Why was I into this guyÔºå What were we talking aboutÔºå That's called associative„ÄÇ

MeThat's why when you're depressedÔºå you can only think about depressive things or depressive experiences that you've had in your life„ÄÇ

 when you're happyÔºå you can only think about happy experiences that you've had in your life or happy things„ÄÇ

When this girl is at the office the next day and she gets a text from you„ÄÇ

 it's almost like getting a text from another dimension„ÄÇ

 She's completely alienated from that environment„ÄÇ She probably has a fuzzy memory of that because she's in another mode„ÄÇ

 and she's not necessarily open to talking to someone from that mode„ÄÇ

 That's why you'll also get this weird effect where you might get a number from a girl„ÄÇ

 it was a really solid interaction„ÄÇ you text her the next dayÔºå you don't hear anything from her„ÄÇ

 And then next Friday nightÔºå you get a text back„ÄÇ Why is this happening„ÄÇ Associative memory„ÄÇ

 She's in that state again„ÄÇ And now she can remember likeÔºå ohÔºå yeahÔºå Last time is in that state„ÄÇ

 that guyÔºå OhÔºå he is actually pretty awesome„ÄÇ But the net effect of this is that no matter how solid the interaction is during nighttime interactions„ÄÇ

 You will usually not convert most of those numbers to dates„ÄÇ

 And it's kind of just a waste of your time„ÄÇ You have to think about opportunity cost„ÄÇ

 The time that you're spending texting all these numbers could be better spent doing any number of productive things or being on Tider or talking to girls during the daytime„ÄÇ

 which creates more solid„ÄÇüòäÔºåNumbers because it doesn't have that same associative memory effect„ÄÇ

So actually taking the girl from the club to your house to her house and how does that look what kind of pitfalls might you run into So first realize that there's a window There's a window kind of at the end of the night where people are figuring out what do I do next„ÄÇ

 What do I want to do they're not quite tired yetÔºå they still want a party and this creates a certain window of time when it is most viable for you to be taking this girl home„ÄÇ

If you do this too soonÔºå it might be abrupt„ÄÇ She might want to stay and party some more„ÄÇ

 if you do this too late„ÄÇ She might be tired„ÄÇ the caffeine is wearing offÔºå et cetera„ÄÇ

 So you kind of have to get a sense of when is this window„ÄÇ

 And the window might be earlier in the night„ÄÇ Maybe she's just really„ÄÇ

 really into you and she really wants to go spend time with you alone at that point„ÄÇ Still„ÄÇ

 if you wait too longÔºå she might think that your're a pussy and that window will be open„ÄÇ

 If you do it too soon iss just going to come off as too abrupt„ÄÇ

 So get a sense of where that window is with each individual girl„ÄÇNext„ÄÇ

 picking her place versus your place„ÄÇ I usually like to do my place is just a environment I know much„ÄÇ

 much better„ÄÇ I've run into problems at the girl's place„ÄÇ

 I actually once had a three sum at a girl's place„ÄÇ

 And a cat was bothering me started to take out a laser pointer and point the laser at the wall so that the cat would stopmp bothering us and would let us have a threesome„ÄÇ

 SoÔºå you knowÔºå this is a style thing„ÄÇ This is really up to you„ÄÇ PersonalÔºå I like my place„ÄÇ

 I know where everything is at my place„ÄÇ There's not going to be a roommate bothering us„ÄÇ

 There's not going to be a cat bothering us„ÄÇ It's just an environment„ÄÇ you know„ÄÇ

 as opposed to when you don't„ÄÇüòîÔºåSo you're in the club„ÄÇ

 You've realized that you're within that window„ÄÇ How do you actually take her out„ÄÇ Well„ÄÇ

 we talked about leading„ÄÇ You should always be leading through this process„ÄÇ

 So you've seeed the poll„ÄÇ and then the end of seeing the poll is saying something likeÔºå oh yeah„ÄÇ

 I want to go show you that view or saying something likeÔºå yeah„ÄÇ

 looks like we're really getting along„ÄÇ We should go back to my house and see where this goes„ÄÇ

 You knowÔºå that kind of implicit or explicit„ÄÇ You know where this is going„ÄÇ

 we're not even gonna fuck around about this„ÄÇ Like we're going back to our house to hook up And we do say that many„ÄÇ

 many times„ÄÇ If you want to be more implicit about thisÔºå just say something likeÔºå ohÔºå yeah„ÄÇ

 there's an amazing view at my hotel or we're having this afterpart by the way„ÄÇ

 the afterparty should actually be realÔºå but yesÔºå we're going back to my house for this and this reason„ÄÇ

 So you take her handÔºå start leading lead outside the club know how to get there so that you're not thinking or fumbling with your phone about oh„ÄÇ

 do I call an UberÔºå Do I get a cab or whatÔºå know how you're gonna get there ahead of time„ÄÇ

 make transport time short„ÄÇ This means not walking three miles not getting in a cab and going 20 minutes away„ÄÇ

You're going to a place that is close where the energy can stay high in the interaction and you don't have to worry about this extended purgatory where you're not at the club and you're not at your home either During this time when you guys are walking out of the club when you're getting into the Uber when you're getting into a taxi when you're getting into her car into your car when you're driving there when you're going up to your place This is a great time to continue the fun and continue the conversation that you were having do not be one of these people that just freezes up and thinks it's already in the bag who just doesn't say anything during this transport time that is a great way to kill the night„ÄÇ

 it's a great way to kill the interaction every part of taking the girl home and every new context should also be fun you should also be expressing your personality you should be acting exactly the same as how you are acting when you guys got to know each other in the original environment when you get there when you get to your place when you get to her place Let her adjust to the new environment„ÄÇ

 this means not like tackling her trying to hook up„ÄÇAs soon as you get in there„ÄÇ

 just normalize the new environment for five to 10 minutes„ÄÇ

 a lot of times she'll start escalating on you during this time it just makes it a lot more normal of a situation then you guys can start making out hooking up etc and I would actually suggest waiting maybe five minutes past the point where you would go for sex this will give her time to actually escalate a little bit more on you and then this builds the sexual attention for her as well so I will often get to a point where she's escalating on me way way more than I'm escalating on her that creates a much more compelling situation for her because no fucking guy does that so just give her time when you get there and then give her time as you guys are hooking up and not having sex then you guys can have sex I'm not gonna to get into that but you guys have seen the movies I hope you know how that actually happens„ÄÇ

NextÔºå little primer on crazy sexual situationsÔºå3 sums„ÄÇ

 sex in weird environments like in the back of a car or something„ÄÇ

 maybe trying some new sexual situation that you are both curious about„ÄÇ

 So how do the best guys in the world actually do this„ÄÇ Well„ÄÇ

 if you really want to know about three sums„ÄÇ I would refer you to the interview with Derek and Jeffie is the best interview ever on three sums„ÄÇ

 But I'll give you a little primer on these crazy sexual situations right now„ÄÇ So first„ÄÇ

 you have to frame this as if it's something completely normal„ÄÇ you've done this a million times„ÄÇ

 and it's really not that big of a deal„ÄÇ So which do you think is gonna be more conducive to a three sum saying something like„ÄÇ

 ohÔºå yeahÔºå it's something I've always wanted to tryÔºå I'm a little nervous about it„ÄÇ But you know„ÄÇ

 I think it could be fun or saying something likeÔºå ohÔºå yeahÔºå yeahÔºå I've had a million of those„ÄÇ

 It's really not that big of a deal„ÄÇ It's a lot of fun„ÄÇ ButÔºå you knowÔºå yeah„ÄÇ

 I've already know how to do that„ÄÇ But yeahÔºå we should do thatÔºå We should do that„ÄÇ

 The second one makes her feel more confident about her decision„ÄÇ as in she's„ÄÇ

Going to be with someone who knows the situationÔºå who can lead her through the situation„ÄÇ

 who can make it not awkward and it's just not going to be that big of a deal at all you're not going to be like this first guy's three sum or something like that„ÄÇ

SecondÔºå leadingÔºå you want to be the one leading your through the specific situation„ÄÇ So once again„ÄÇ

 let's say that you're having a threesome„ÄÇ If you're just like standing there with your fucking hands in the air„ÄÇ

 likeÔºå ohÔºå what do we do nextÔºå What's going to happen next„ÄÇ

 What do like what happens in the next part of this„ÄÇ

 It's going to make it a very awkward experience for her„ÄÇ NoÔºå you have to be the one to lead this„ÄÇ

 The girls are going to be looking to you to make the next moves and to make this a fluid experience for both of them„ÄÇ

 So you have to take that onus on yourself to lead the situation and to make each new move„ÄÇüò°ÔºåLastly„ÄÇ

 normalizing what is happening„ÄÇ So let's say that you guys are having sex in the back of a car„ÄÇ

 And you keep saying likeÔºå ohÔºå this is so crazy„ÄÇ OhÔºå this is so weird„ÄÇ

 This so weird that we're having sex in the back of the car„ÄÇ Once again„ÄÇ

 just makes it a completely awkward experience„ÄÇ You have to normalize this as if this is just like any other sex you've had with her„ÄÇ

 This is just a normal thing that people do„ÄÇ having sex in the back of the car„ÄÇ

 It's a completely normal thingÔºå having a threesome„ÄÇ It's a completely normal thing„ÄÇ

 And this is just like every other sexual situation that you've had with her„ÄÇ

 except for maybe a little bit more exciting„ÄÇ That's the one thing that you can say about is like„ÄÇ

 ohÔºå yeahÔºå this is fun„ÄÇ This is exciting„ÄÇ So what's the commonality just making this a fluid experience that she feels comfortable in where she's not going to feel like it's going to be weird like you're not going to know what you're doing„ÄÇ

 It's just going to be a niceÔºå fluid experience for the both of you„ÄÇüòäÔºåNow„ÄÇ

 I'm going to talk a little bit about relationships and the common pitfalls that I see guys fall into when they get into relationships„ÄÇ

 I'm also going to talk about some of the things I've seen Derek do that make relationships awesome„ÄÇ

 I think he's particularly good at relationships to the point where when I saw what his relationship was like„ÄÇ

 I really felt like it was one of the first truly healthy relationships I've ever seen„ÄÇ So first„ÄÇ

 your life should neverÔºå just be about her„ÄÇ You should always have a purpose that is beyond her„ÄÇ

 Think about this in terms of having a friend„ÄÇ If your entire life was just about that friendship„ÄÇ

 it would come off as extremely needy and you would have nothing to give to that friendship„ÄÇ

 People want to be friends with someone who has a purpose„ÄÇ

 who knows what that purpose is and puts their purpose above everything else„ÄÇ

 They don't want to be with someone who only cares about them because it's weird and it's needy and creates a situation where there is too much pressure on the relationship„ÄÇ

This means maintaining your lifeÔºå not letting your emotions be 100 per tied to what she is doing„ÄÇ

 HonestlyÔºå you should feel the same wayÔºå you should feel that internal sense of happiness„ÄÇ

 no matter what your girls doing„ÄÇ no matter what anyone one is doing„ÄÇ

 You are the person that should be maintaining the happiness of the relationship by not letting the relationship get to you„ÄÇ

 And I've seen a lot of guys do veryÔºå very wellÔºå by focusing on their purpose rather than the relationship„ÄÇ

 And I've seen a lot of guys do veryÔºå very poorly by not focusing on their purpose„ÄÇ

 and by letting that relationship be the only thing that is affecting their emotions„ÄÇ Second„ÄÇ

 continuing to lead the relationship and not falling into socially conditioned ideas of what a relationship should look like„ÄÇ

 So you should continue being certain of yourself„ÄÇ You should continue fucking killing it at life„ÄÇ

 you should continue being that dominant guyÔºå the guy that just lives his own purpose does what he wants and is naturally leading the relationship„ÄÇ

 A lot of guys will„ÄÇGet stuck into these socially conditioned views of what a relationship should look like„ÄÇ

 So their girl will watch a bunch of romantic comedies„ÄÇ

 or they will go and watch a bunch of romantic comedies„ÄÇ And they'll sayÔºå ohÔºå wellÔºå you know„ÄÇ

 it seems like the girls in these movies really like it when I let them make all the decisions„ÄÇ

 or I've read all this social theoryÔºå and it really says that I should just let her lead the relationship„ÄÇ

 I should just defer to herÔºå always defer to herÔºå always be asking„ÄÇ

 what does she want in the relationshipÔºå Where does she want to go to dinnerÔºå What's her reality„ÄÇ

 Where does she want to lead us„ÄÇ LookÔºå part of the reason a girl goes with a guy with a very strong personality is because she knows that he's going to be leading that relationship through the relationship„ÄÇ

 He's going to be making a lot of the decisions„ÄÇ He's going to be setting the emotional tone„ÄÇ

 He's going to be decidingÔºå okayÔºå where do we eat„ÄÇ What are we doing„ÄÇ

 What adventures are we going onÔºå RememberÔºå we talked about building that adventure„ÄÇ

 He's going to be creating that adventure and then she can become a part of thatÔºü

 This makes a more fun romantic experience for these girls where they can get„ÄÇüòä„ÄÇ

Whked away into a new exciting reality„ÄÇ A lot of times„ÄÇ

 guys will dole down the relationship by always be asking the girlÔºå ohÔºå what do you want to do„ÄÇ

 What do you want to doÔºå What do you want to doÔºå But what they don't realize is that she was with you because you are a leader„ÄÇ

 And if you don't leadÔºå she is eventually going to be attracted to someone else„ÄÇ

 and she will start following his lead„ÄÇDo not fall into this very painful life lesson„ÄÇ

 A lot of people are going to tell you the exact opposites„ÄÇ likeÔºå ohÔºå girls don't actually want that„ÄÇ

 NoÔºå noÔºå the girl wants to be making the decisions„ÄÇ The girl wants to be making the decisions„ÄÇ

 You'll read a book that saysÔºå ohÔºå noÔºå you should always be asking her„ÄÇ

 You should always be asking her„ÄÇ But this is going to lead to a situation where she's going to become bored and you will get a very painful life lesson of what happens when you buy into other people's ideas about how romance works„ÄÇ

 This doesn't mean that you should never ask her„ÄÇ obviouslyÔºå let the girl give you input„ÄÇ

 Let the girl make the decision every once in a while„ÄÇ

 Let the girl tell you where she wants to go to dinner where she wants to go have fun what she wants to do„ÄÇ

 ObviouslyÔºå obviously get the girl's input„ÄÇ but don't fall into the trap of feeling like you have to let her lead all the time„ÄÇ

 That's not going to create long term attraction„ÄÇ3„ÄÇ

 set expectations about who you are from the beginning„ÄÇ What this mean A lot of guys„ÄÇ

 they will sort of tiptoe their way into a relationship where they'll be likeÔºå ohÔºå no„ÄÇ

 I'm just a nice guy„ÄÇ I'm just a wholesome guy I'm just a veryÔºå very wholesome guy„ÄÇ

 And then they're surprised when they get into the relationship and it's not sexual„ÄÇ It's not fun„ÄÇ

 She's constantly calling him out on things he's doing that aren't wholesome and nice guy alike„ÄÇ

 BasicallyÔºå he presented himself as someone that he's not„ÄÇ

 Now he's trying to change the relationship„ÄÇ and she's gonna to be bitter about that„ÄÇ

 So whatever type of guy you are set that expectation from the beginning„ÄÇ A good example of this„ÄÇ

 One of my friends is very into BDSM„ÄÇ So with his last girlfriend„ÄÇ

 he talked about BDSM on the first date„ÄÇ He talked about that throughout the interactions that LED to the relationship„ÄÇ

 Turns out she was into the same thing„ÄÇ And there is an expectation set that that would be a part of the relationship„ÄÇ

 NowÔºå imagine if he had waited six months into the relationship to set that expectation„ÄÇ

 And he's just likeÔºå ohÔºå by the wayÔºå honeyÔºå I'm really into time„ÄÇGls up„ÄÇ

 and I'm really into people whipping me or whatever the fuck's into„ÄÇ Be kind of weirdÔºå wouldn't it„ÄÇ

 be just a littleÔºå little weird„ÄÇ You have to set that expectation of who you are from the beginning„ÄÇ

 and that's not just sexual preferencesÔºå That means what type of humor you like the way you speak„ÄÇ

 what your goals areÔºå what type of person you areÔºå what type of things you enjoy doing All of that should be basically implied within the first hour of meeting her„ÄÇ

 not on the first year anniversary„ÄÇ numberumb4Ôºå setting expectations about what the relationship will be like„ÄÇ

 specificallyÔºå I meanÔºå how much time you will be spending with her„ÄÇ whether it's exclusive or not„ÄÇ

 whether this is heading towards marriageÔºå etc ceter„ÄÇ So once again„ÄÇ

 why do a lot of guys get a bad rap„ÄÇ WellÔºå they will want only sex„ÄÇ

 but they will play it out as if it is going to be a relationship with this girl„ÄÇ

 and it leads to the girl getting pissedÔºå and it leads to him getting this terrible reputation as a player„ÄÇ

 You want to set the expectations„ÄÇWhat the relationship will actually consist of from the beginning„ÄÇ

 HoweverÔºå this doesn't necessarily mean that the girl will like these expectations„ÄÇ

 I've had a situation where I told the girlÔºå lookÔºå I'm in a very intense work period I'm only going to be able to see you maybe once every two weeks for a couple of hours and if you're not okay with that that's fine but you need to find someone else because that's the type of relationship we're gonna have and I can't do anything else right now she agreed to it about a month later we ended up breaking up because she was texting me so much complaining saying like you know you never text me we never see each other and I was like yeah I mean that's basically what I told you the relationship would be like So realize you can set these expectations sometimes after a month after even six months you'll realize she doesn't actually want this type of relationship she was pretending to want this type of relationship because she wanted to please you and when that happens„ÄÇ

 you know obviously the relationship has to end but it's better if you at least told her from the beginning and we're honest about what the relationship was gonna be like„ÄÇ

Number 5Ôºå nonjudmentÔºå having an air of nonjudgment about her past sexual experiences or really anything else that she could be open with you about„ÄÇ

 What this meanÔºå WellÔºå I'll tell you a story about what happens when you are judgmental about your girlfriend's past sexual experiences„ÄÇ

 her sexual desires and what type of sexual experiences she wants to have in the future„ÄÇ

 me and Michael went to Vegas recently„ÄÇ And we ended up hooking up with two cousins„ÄÇ Now„ÄÇ

 I had no idea that this girl had a boyfriend beforehand„ÄÇ

 But we found out afterwards when Michael's girl told him and then she told Michael that my girl had a boyfriend as well„ÄÇ

 NowÔºå my girl had mentioned something about how all the guys in her life previously had been super judgmental about her sexual desires„ÄÇ

 super judgmental about the fact that she wanted to have three sums that she wanted to have male„ÄÇ

 male three sumsÔºå GirlÔºå girl 3 sums that she wanted to go to Vegas and hook up with people that she wanted to have these experiences and since she came from a judgmental culture„ÄÇ

 And because her boyfriends in the past„ÄÇAnd her current boyfriendÔºå I pieced together„ÄÇ

 was also judgmental about this stuff„ÄÇ She never felt comfortable relaying that to him„ÄÇ

 And then those desires just came out in unhealthy ways„ÄÇ Aka her cheating on her boyfriend„ÄÇ

 So you have to create this air that you are non-judgmental that whatever experiences she's had whatever experiences she wants to have look„ÄÇ

 you don't care„ÄÇ sex isn't a big deal„ÄÇ you aren't going be judgmental about those things„ÄÇ

 I've dated manyÔºå many girls where at the beginning of the relationship„ÄÇ

 She'll say something like ohÔºå I've only slept with three guys„ÄÇ

 You're the third guy I've ever slept with„ÄÇ and I'll say yeahÔºå right of courseÔºå yeah„ÄÇ

 that I'm sure I'm sure and she'll say to me she'll swear to me NoÔºå noÔºå no„ÄÇ

 I promise you're the third guy I've ever slept with„ÄÇ

 You're the third guy I've ever slept with Then after we get to know each other after about a month„ÄÇ

 She'll say something like yeahÔºå lookÔºå I know you're not judgmental now so I can actually tell you this but Ive slept with 20 guys or something like that or she'll relay to me Yeah„ÄÇ

 I always had this fantasy that I want to do and it's a little weird but I feel comfortable sharing that with you guysy think that they're gonna get rid of these fantasies or they're going to get rid„ÄÇ

This behavior by judging it girlsÔºå you're not going to get rid of the behavior remember„ÄÇ

 never get in the way of someone else's selfishness All that's going to happen is it's going to come out in situations without you so do not be judgmental in your relationships„ÄÇ

SÔºå reward for good behavior„ÄÇThis is pretty obvious„ÄÇ

 but you should be rewarding her for the things she does right instead of criticizing her for the things she does wrong„ÄÇ

 I've seen criticism on both sides hollow out a relationship and ruin it„ÄÇ

 The other thing that you have to remember is whatever you expect someone will do„ÄÇ

 that is what they will do„ÄÇ So if you expect your girlfriend to cheat and you're always being like„ÄÇ

 ohÔºå you're not being loyal„ÄÇ You're not being loyal in this way„ÄÇ You're not being loyal in this way„ÄÇ

 You looked at this guy„ÄÇ You're talking to your ex boyfriend or whatever„ÄÇ EventuallyÔºå on some level„ÄÇ

 she's just going to goÔºå okayÔºå wellÔºå he already thinks I'm cheating on him„ÄÇ So I might as well„ÄÇ

HoweverÔºå if you set positive expectationsÔºå if you reward her for good behaviorÔºå you sayÔºå oh my God„ÄÇ

 I love how fit you are„ÄÇ I love how good you are at this„ÄÇ I love how good you are at that„ÄÇ

 I love how loyal you are„ÄÇ I love how loving you are towards me„ÄÇ

 She's going to do more of that behavior„ÄÇ There's been many„ÄÇ

 many studies that people will do more of the behaviorÔºå you reward them for„ÄÇ However„ÄÇ

 if you criticize them or punish them for behaviorÔºå they might stop that behavior temporarily„ÄÇ

 but they will end up doing the same amount of that behavior you punish them for„ÄÇüòäÔºå7Ôºå being very„ÄÇ

 very nurturing„ÄÇ This is something I learned from Derek„ÄÇ So when I saw Derek„ÄÇ

 I saw how loving he was towards this girl„ÄÇ I saw how nurturing he was towards this girl„ÄÇ

 I saw how kind he wasÔºå how he complimented her constantly„ÄÇ He wasn't needy about this„ÄÇ

 But he created an air of just like loveÔºå nurturing that they were perfect for each other„ÄÇ

 And she did this back to him„ÄÇ And I don't see that sort of loving„ÄÇ

 nurturing vibe in most relationships„ÄÇ RememberÔºå you should be creating the aura that your relationship is better than anyone else's that you guys are dating someone that would be better for each other than anyone else in the world„ÄÇ

 I think this is pretty selfexplanatory„ÄÇ ObviouslyÔºå don't do this to a point of being needy„ÄÇ

 Don't do this when she's backing off„ÄÇ Don't become like more loving and more nurturing„ÄÇ

 That's called neediness„ÄÇ But just generally create a vibe that is nurturing„ÄÇ

 loving rather than creating a vibe that is dull or critical towards each other or maybe just static„ÄÇ

üòäÔºå8Ôºå showing vulnerabilityÔºå but not being a little bitch„ÄÇ

 I see a lot of guys get confused because they will show vulnerability in one part of the relationship„ÄÇ

 and then they'll do it again in another part of the relationship and will have opposite effect„ÄÇ

 As in in one partÔºå they'll share something about themselves„ÄÇ And the girl will be likeÔºå oh my God„ÄÇ

 that's so amazing„ÄÇ You knowÔºå I can't believe that you share that with me in another part„ÄÇ

 they will share something about themselves„ÄÇ and it will completely fuck up the relationship„ÄÇ

 And the girl will be likeÔºå ohÔºå you knowÔºå I already I always knew that you didn't have character or whatever the fuck„ÄÇ

 So what is actually happening here„ÄÇ WellÔºå the girl wants to see you being vulnerable„ÄÇ

 She wants to see you share those things about you that are not perfect„ÄÇ However„ÄÇ

 she wants to know that this is a vulnerability and not necessarily a character flaw„ÄÇ

 And she wants to know that this is not a contradiction to the type of character traits that you portrayed from the beginning„ÄÇ

 So what's the difference„ÄÇ WellÔºå here's a vulnerability„ÄÇ OhÔºå you know„ÄÇ

 I was very poor when I was a kid and this was very upsetting„ÄÇ And I had to overcome„ÄÇ

A lot of this stuff and honestly for a long timeÔºå I had no idea if I would end up in poverty or if I would make it„ÄÇ

 if I would ever make it as a successful person„ÄÇHere's an example of a weakness„ÄÇ You know„ÄÇ

 I just can't stop thinking about your ex boyfriendfriends and I'm having all these dreams about you guys fucking„ÄÇ

 and you know I I'm just overcome with jealousy„ÄÇ I'm just overcome with jealousy„ÄÇ

 So one is portraying the hard parts of your life something that you might not tell most people but saying„ÄÇ

 lookÔºå I'm still the same person and I do have texture to my life„ÄÇ I do have hard parts of my life„ÄÇ

 but I'm still that same guy that you thought I was„ÄÇ The other part is saying look„ÄÇ

 I'm really not that guy that you thought I was„ÄÇ I'm actually this completely different guy„ÄÇ

 and everything that I've told you about myselfÔºå everything that I portrayed about myself was actually a ruse and none of it was really true at all„ÄÇ

 Also realize that showing your vulnerabilities when you guys are in an argument or when you're fighting or when you're in a hard part of relationship is not ideal„ÄÇ

 Don't get paranoid but just not ideal„ÄÇ you want to be sharing these vulnerabilities when you guys are in a good part of your relationship„ÄÇ

 It makes it easier for her to not blow it out of context as in like oh you were poor„ÄÇ

 you just you know you have a lose her mind„ÄÇüò°ÔºåOr something like that„ÄÇ

 right an argument is not a good place to be adding that stuff in„ÄÇFinallyÔºå knowing your boundaries„ÄÇ

Throughout a relationshipÔºå she will be giving you sort of longterm tests„ÄÇ

 You all know what a shit test is„ÄÇ A girl tries to throw you off balance by saying something„ÄÇ

 and you have to show that you're unwaverreed in your thoughts and emotions to pass itÔºå et cetera„ÄÇ

 WellÔºå these tests still exist in relationshipsÔºå but they get a little bit more real and long term„ÄÇ

 So you might come home and you're very tired And the girl just attacks you and starts arguing with you and you're wondering like„ÄÇ

 why nowÔºå You knowÔºå why did she choose now to start this argument„ÄÇ Well„ÄÇ

 that's a long termm test to seeÔºå is this guy who he says he isÔºå even when he's tired„ÄÇ

 Even when he's at his lowest pointÔºå I he still that guy that I think he is„ÄÇ

 She's gonna to be doing longterm tests„ÄÇ And you should also be observing her behavior to see if she's long termm compatible„ÄÇ

 And this all goes back to knowing your boundaries„ÄÇ knowing your boundaries sayingÔºå okay„ÄÇ

 in this situationÔºå you knowÔºå I'm not gonna waver in this situation„ÄÇ

 I'm not gonna waver and then knowing your boundaries for herÔºå likeÔºå okay„ÄÇ

 this is what I find acceptable in a relationshipÔºå This is what I don't example of a boundary that you might not find acceptable„ÄÇ

If the girl actually like physically hits you or something like that„ÄÇ

 if the girl starts breaking stuff in your houseÔºå you have to have those boundaries for yourself„ÄÇ

 you have to have those boundaries for the girlÔºå and so the boundaries for yourself help you pass those long term tests„ÄÇ

 the boundaries for her prevent the relationship from going to an unhealthy area„ÄÇLastly„ÄÇ

 relationship problemsÔºå arguments„ÄÇ Every couple gets into arguments eventually„ÄÇ

 And you have to suss outÔºå Is this a real argument or a fake argument„ÄÇ As in„ÄÇ

 is she upset because their milk went bad in our refrigerator„ÄÇ And now she's yelling at me for it„ÄÇ

 or is she upset because I actually did something that violated her expectations of who I amÔºå Now„ÄÇ

 I was having a conversation with my friend about this„ÄÇ

 And he was saying that his girlfriend didn't like some of his humor because it brought back traumatic memories„ÄÇ

 And he was wonderingÔºå do I stop telling those jokes„ÄÇ

 or do I still express my humor to the absolute hilt„ÄÇ

 And I felt like this illustrated an important concept in relationships„ÄÇ Yes„ÄÇ

 you want to be yourself to the absolute hilt„ÄÇ But you have to find out what those little things are that our subjective to her worldview that you need to be sensitive to„ÄÇ

 Here's a good example„ÄÇ If I am friends with someone who is just hilarious„ÄÇ They're loud„ÄÇ

 They're boisterous„ÄÇ They're just have a crazy personality„ÄÇ And I love that about„ÄÇüòä„ÄÇ

I'm not going to think more of them„ÄÇ I'm not going to like them more if they burst into my room in the middle of the night hours before work and start waking me up with their humor and boisterousness„ÄÇ

 It's not going to make me feel better about themÔºå even though they were just expressing their humor and personality„ÄÇ

 I'm still gonna be fucking pissed„ÄÇ So you have to have that sense of what is this person's subjective worldview„ÄÇ

 what kind of pressures are they under what kind of experiences have they had„ÄÇ

 and you should have a sense of which parts of that should I be sensitive to and how do I understand her worldview„ÄÇ

 So what does this have to do with arguments„ÄÇ Well„ÄÇ

 understanding these parts of her helps you su out which arguments are real„ÄÇ

 and then which arguments are based on nothingÔºå and for real argumentsÔºå you should actually engage„ÄÇ

 for fake arguments you should actually engageÔºå but in a different way„ÄÇ

 So how do you handle relationship arguments„ÄÇ There's four parts„ÄÇ Numb oneÔºå remain calm„ÄÇ

 If she's yelling your head off and then you start yelling your head off„ÄÇ

 Nothing good is going happen„ÄÇ You have to remain calm„ÄÇ Keep your frame„ÄÇüò°„ÄÇ

Everything is fine and that you're gonna have a productive conversation„ÄÇ Second„ÄÇ

 clarity of communication„ÄÇ oftentimesÔºå especially over text during these situations„ÄÇ

 things can get misinterpreted and things can go wrong„ÄÇ

 So you want to choose your words very carefully and articulate exactly what you are thinking at that moment„ÄÇ

 ThirdÔºå convey that you guys are on the same side„ÄÇ Instead of aÔºå this is you versus me„ÄÇ

 tell her like lookÔºå it's not you versus me„ÄÇ it's us together„ÄÇ

 we are trying to figure out what's going wrong here„ÄÇ It's us together versus the problem„ÄÇ

4 solution focused„ÄÇ do not get into criticizing or arguing or any sort of unproductive talk„ÄÇ

 just keep it focused on the solution to the argument„ÄÇ So for those real arguments„ÄÇ

 this subtle nuance is you want to be veryÔºå very attuned to what she' saying and what her subjective worldview is for fake arguments„ÄÇ

 you want to make it known that if there is ever a real argumentsÔºå you will engage with the problem„ÄÇ

 but that during a fake argument where she is making all these negative„ÄÇ

Mos and anger for no reason that you are not going to engage in that„ÄÇ

 And each of these different arguments should have that calmnessÔºå clarityity of communication„ÄÇ

 telling her that you're on the same side and should be solution focused„ÄÇ

Another relationship problem„ÄÇ Why do girls cheat„ÄÇ Sometimes it's just because the girl just doesn't have any boundaries for herself„ÄÇ

 She doesn't have any boundaries for her relationships„ÄÇ And just generallyÔºå she's not that mature„ÄÇ

 she's not that grown upÔºå so she might tell you you're an exclusive relationship but she might do something other than that because she just doesn't really have any boundaries„ÄÇ

 So I'm not saying that every cheating situation falls into what I'm about to talk about„ÄÇ However„ÄÇ

 a lot of cheating situations do„ÄÇ and they fall into one of the following two categories„ÄÇ N one„ÄÇ

 she's meeting a guy that's more funÔºå has more valueÔºå gives one of her sexual needs to her„ÄÇ

 gives her a better adventureÔºå has more certaintyÔºå etc cetera„ÄÇ she's just more attracted to that guy„ÄÇ

2Ôºå she is attracted to youÔºå she does feel that sense of certainty that funÔºå sexual„ÄÇ

 whatever she does feel that buy from you„ÄÇ but she just feels neglected from you at that particular time„ÄÇ

 So what do these two things have in common„ÄÇ WellÔºå her emotional needs are not being met„ÄÇ

 So whether you're on either side of the coinÔºå you're neglecting on her„ÄÇ

Or maybe you're just being a little bit too needy and you're not living up to being the man that you said you were„ÄÇ

 you have to realize that a lot of negative outcomes come from when the girl is not having her emotional needs met and you have to be very cognizant of whether that's happening or not„ÄÇ

Last thing I'll say about relationships„ÄÇ I see a lot of guys get into relationships with someone because they think that they have shared values with that person„ÄÇ

 Then over timeÔºå they realize that they don'tÔºå but they're so caught up in what they thought this girl was in the person that they thought this girl was„ÄÇ

 that they never break up with her and find the person that is actually right for them„ÄÇ

 What I would say to you is that if you're in that type of relationship or if you get into that type of relationship„ÄÇ

 stop fooling yourself„ÄÇ realize that you only see someone's true values what they're really like over time„ÄÇ

 and that you are not doing her any favors or not doing yourself any favors by staying in that relationship„ÄÇ

 You are actually preventing both her and yourself from finding that person that is actually right for you„ÄÇ

 So be aware that at any point in the relationship„ÄÇ

 you should constantly be reevaluating whether this person is so right for you or whether you should both find other opportunities„ÄÇ
