# 【社交光谱】泰勒《蓝图解码2.0重铸蓝图》标准班：03_11.高地位语调传达--01_11.高地位语调传达_ev

是社交官谱莱特。那么我们继续蓝图2。0之旅。本次呢是一节实操课，这个实操课跟之前讲的融入语言啊，有着紧密的联系，也就是语音语调啊，在人际交往中的一个重要性。

以及如何通过练习不同的语调来提升社交魅力和影响力。在视频的开头呢，我先给大家解释几个概念。第一个就是TRNRBR是演讲者提到的三种不同语言模式的一个缩写，它什么意思呢？

TRtry for report尝试融洽这种语调模式的特点呢？是在剧尾上扬。类似于提问的语气。如果过度使用TR语调可能会给一种低地位，缺乏自信和界限感的印象。它可能暗示说话者啊缺乏社交资源。

过于迎合他人。在多数情况下呢，你应该去避免使用TR语调，尤其是在你希望展现自信和领导力的一个场合大概的一个。声调就是这样子的。嘿最近怎么样？最近怎么样？类似于这种语调。

第二种呢是NR就是naural report中性融洽，这是一种较为平衡中性的语调模式。NR语调呢适合在你希望邀请他人，让对方感到舒适的场合使用，特别是你觉察到对方可能感觉到害怕或者是不自在的时候。

例如你跟新的一个客户会面，或者你作为一个面试者去面试新员工，或者与初次见面的人交谈时，使用NR语调可以营造一种友好包容的氛围。呃，大概的一个语气是这样子的。嘿最近怎么样？嘿最近怎么样？

类似于这种那BR呢就是breaking report打破融洽。这种语调模式的特点呢，是在具为降调，使用BR语调传出的是高地位和明确的界限感。它表明说话者呢有着丰富的资源，不需要从他人那里获得什么？

这是他更有吸引力。BR语调呢适合在你。希望展示自己的独立性、自信和领导力的一个场合使用。比如在工作中指挥团队或者组持会议或者在社交场合展现魅力。嘿，最近怎么样？嘿，最近怎么样？

这就是中文所说的抑扬顿义或者是语气语调中的中气足，声音呢能够传达气场，传递思想，很多人说话呢？他没有情绪，他很平淡，语调呢？作为一个副语言的一个信号，传递出说话者的情绪。意图和一些个人的特质。

那什么样的声音最吸引女性呢？是那种具有磁性的嗓音，男性一般磁性的嗓音是最容易吸引异性的。我来给大家学一学啊。就像我这种充满磁性的嗓音。还有一种呢就是呃网上比较流行的气泡音呃呃气泡音呃，气泡音就是这种。

但是我觉得有一点说哎比较吸引男性的是什么呢？御姐音啊，我学不会，还有种什么夹子音加子音哦。🎼有一点恶心啊，好吧，那如何去锻炼我们这种音调呢或者语气呢？你可以多去看一看综艺啊。

比如说一些呃综艺节目关于配声的啊，之前湖南卫视好像有关于一个声音的一个节目。比如说我是优等生之类的。好，那我们进入正片，让我们来感受一下TRNR和BR的各种语调，以及他的所展现的气势。

So the next exercise we're going to do， we're going to go into vocal tonality， okay。

 we're going to switch it back now， okay， vocal tone。

I'm going to show you three vocal tones that you're going to use right now， okay？😡，By the way。

 when you do the things that I said， your partner， the people you date and the people you work with and are friends with will be so appreciative。

 you know why？Because they're going to value you more。

Who would you rather be friends with your knucklehead friend or like Hugh Hefner when he's alive。

 inviting you to crazy parties， you get to brag that your friends with Hugh Hefner。

 even if you Hefner had a boundary， even if you were a little bit walking on eggshells around Hugh Hefner。

 wouldn't you much more value the friendship with him？Right？

Versus your knucklehead friend it'll take all your crap。

 so you're actually doing a favor to the people who you associate with。When you do this。

 your partner will be aroused by you years later and when you don't do it。

 they'll be unroused and resentful in most cases， not all。

 I can't speak to every case there's always exceptions， like the drunken Kung Fo master， like I said。

😡，So next up， what you have is vocal tonalityity。 Now watch this。 Hey， how's it going， Hey。

 how's it going， Hey， how's it going， Okay， now' Ive made that in a subtle way。😡。

So what you have is called uptaallk， you have trying for rapport。

 neutral rapport and breaking rapport Now why am I teaching this right after the previous segment they dovetail into each others the reason I'm teaching this right after。

😡，If you don't have any social alliances or friends or aren't dating anybody。

 where is your vocal tonality more likely to go， trying for rapport。

 neutral rapport or breaking rapport， where is it likely to go so when you use what's called uptaallk and you're trying to get rapport。

😡，What is that showing the person？It is showing them that you probably don't have a lot of friends and that they that person doesn't need to invest in you。

 And it shows you have no boundary。 There's not a lot of a boundary there。So hey， how's it going。

 another one is eyebrows up。😡，A smile， a painted on smile， an up talk。

If somebody comes from a foreign country to a new country and they feel scared。

 they're scared and they're in a foreign country， maybe they work it like the laundrymat。

 they're like， hey， how's it going in an accent because the fact that they're scared by the new environment。

 have you ever seen that？Hey， yes， yes， yes， yes， yes。Kills their status。

 They're doing that because they're new to a country who wouldn't feel that way， right。

 if I've been a foreign country， I' feel I'd be like。You know， I'm okay， right。

 you don't want to do that， it shows low status。😡，So。Hey， how's it going？Hey， how's it going？A。

 how's it going， You see the difference。 The last 1 I did in a subtle way。Moving up， neutral。

 moving down。Which one do you think is the most attractive？😡。

When you walk up to if you walk up to someone， which one's the most attractive now， by the way。

 it depends because by the way， if you're somebody who wants to be more inviting to someone。

 you may actually want to use that nice tonality right so if in the dynamic you're wanting to be the person saying I'm inviting you you might be intimidated。

 but I want to invite you then you might actually use， hey， how's it going。

 but if you're the person that wants to show that you have a lot of friends。

 you're the high status person， that environment， then what you use is the downward tone so if you're trying to make if you're trying to if you're trying to get someone who's intimidated by you like say that you were a fan of mine and then you want to come say hi to me。

 I like go nice to meet you， so you feel invited so you'll keep pursuing。

 I want you I want to give you the green light to keep pursuing but likewise if you're the high status person and you want to show that you don't need anything which then makes the other person attracted。

 or make the other person want to network with you or be your friend。

 well that's the case that you use downtonnality what is that show when you have the downtonnality it shows there's。

😡，A boundary。And having a boundary is attractive because people are attracted to a source of energy。

 And when there's a boundary， that contains the energy。People that give rap too quickly。

 they're usually low energy， they don't have a ton to offer because they've been giving it out too much Likewise though it's a paradox remember I said every truth about a half truth。

 say with me every truth is about a half truth。😡，Sa two sides to the same coin。

 So what else have I taught you during the course of this event that you'll gain energy from giving freely？

😡，It's a paradox when you're in what's called release， you're gaining energy from giving freely。

 and yet I'm saying have a boundary， is that weird？Well。

 it's within a context okay like if I come here and I go into release give freely for a few hours。

 then I go home， rest up， then I come here and give freely again。

 the ratio is proportional I'm being financially compensated maybe I would even do it at a free event and I feel a feeling of spiritual growth from the charity aspect of it。

 but also I know when to rest， I'm also not just gonna like leave a big pile of money here。

 just let everybody grab it right so give freely to a point。😡，You it's always a balance right。

 you have to be at a point where you're giving freely and you're gaining energy from giving。

 but at the same time you want to surround yourself in situations that are synergistic and that are win win。

 so give freely， but it also has to be win win。😡，Okay。So it's like， if I do a party。😡，Yeah。

 I'll do a beautiful party， I'll make everybody have fun， but I'm also gonna meet new people to date。

 I'm gonna to make new connections， I'm gonna make new business deals at the party too it's not just me spending 510 grand every weekend on a party until I run out of cash right it's like energy out。

 energy in， energy out， energy in the problem is most people there's so much about energy in that they never give anything and when they never give anything no one wants to engage you。

😡，Okay， so it's a combination。 now Br N RtR， so say， hey， how's it going， Hey， how's it going， Hey。

 what's up？😡，Raise your eyebrows up， what's up？If you like they're profuse nodding， they go， they go。

 ha ha， yeah， hey， it's up， yeah， Okay， try neutral， Hey， how's it going。What's up。

 how are you doing， I'm doing well good。Okay， more neutral， what's up， yo？

How's it going How are we doing over here yo yo？Good to meet you， man。Hey， Owen。

 pleasure to meet you。 Okay， so you see that。 Can you feel the difference in status。

Can you feel a status difference in those， hey， how's it going？😡，Hey， how's it going？What's up guys。

 how are we doing？How are we doing tonight？Can you see the difference there？Okay。

So let's get a couple people up to the front who wants to come up and do an example。

 even if you suck， if you suck， that's even more reason to do an example。😡，Okay， you can come up。

 okay。Can jump up or walk up the stairs。Okay， TR， hey， how's it going？Like up talk， low status。O。Hey。

 how's he going， good neutral？Hey， how's it going and then breaking？Yep。Hey， how's it going， Okay。

 can you guys feel that？Okay， who else wants to come up。 Okay， you too， you stay up here。Okay。

 show me。Here how's it going。Hey， how's it going？Hey， how's it going Okay， he's faking that a bit。

 but yeah， okay， go ahead， the last one hi， how's it going Look a little too real， Okay， go ahead。

Yeah， next one， hi going Okay， next one。Hey， how's it going， Okay， can you see the difference there。

 Yeah Okay， now another thing we want to do。 So we call it positive dominance。 say that with me。

 positive dominance。 So I don't want you to be like， hey， how's it going， Okay， so try being。

 try something very positive right now， Like， hey。What's up， Hey， Whats up， Okay， What's up， guys。

 What's up guys， How's everybody doing， How's everybody doing。

 Then now what I want to do is go scary， What's up， What's up， How's everybody doing。

 How's everybody doing Now combine the two。That's called that's the key of it。

 I know it's tricky because you want to be dominant， but you don't want to look like scary。

s not that's just called scary。 That's not high status。 It's called your' scary。 So what's up。How。

 how is I hope everybody tonight is having a great night， so I can still keep the BR tonality。

 but I can do it positive。 You see that， So show me。😡，Hey， what's up。

 I hope everyone's eyebrows went up， you's scared to do it， but keep going。What's up。

 I hope everyone's having a great night。 getting better。

 And then he gives it like just falling orders。 Look at the end。 Okay， the big ones that I look for。

 raise eyebrows。 The other one is excessive blinking When people try to act confident they overb。

 It's massive。 It's good to like， you can blink。 You can raise your eyebrows。

 It's when you're doing it and the space is coming from that makes a difference。 Okay。

 show me positive dominance。😊，Like个。Guys， thank you so much for being here。Versus guys。

 thanks so much for being here。 Okay， you see the difference。 Okay， guys， I'm so。

 I love you all so much。 Welcome into my event。 Welcome into my home。 I really appreciate you。

 Thank you so much for coming。 right， I can be appreciative。 I can be positive。 so excited。😊。

For everybody to be here， For everybody to be here。What's up， How are we doing， So excited， Okay。

 so you could be positive and yet have the BR tonality。

 It doesn't always have to be the end trailing off。 It can be at different points。

 It doesn't have to be the exact thing。You try again，Hey guys， thank you all for being in my event。

 he's in neutral to trying right now。Thank you so much。Thank you so much。 Okay。

 you see what's happening here now， by the way， for him to be credible as a social media expert。

 because there's still the trying for rapport there。

 it's going to be more difficult for him to get a big following。

 It's also going be harder to ask for a raise， He's going to seem like he wants the raise。

 which means he has an agenda， ironically， the way I'm speaking appears more trustworthy than him because the fact that I'm willing to break rapport in my tone means that I have what I need。

 And if I have what I need than you can trust me。😡，Okay。That's why in dating。

 we do things like teasing。 It's not to lower the person。 It's to build trust。

 There's so many people I've met out where I invite them somewhere they're like， I don't know。

 Did I just tease them a bit， push them away a bit。 They're like， I w to go。

 Why because it's not because I lower their selfestsceem。 That's disgusting。

 That is manipulation or lowering someone selfestseeem delivery is disgusting。

 People should burn in hell for that。 The reason we teach a bit of teasing is to treat somebody normal like a regular person and to show that you're not some creepy person with an agenda。

 That's why we tease。😡，So， and and but people don't get that。

 They just are so easily offended these days。 So right。

 treating someone like a normal human is somehow bad。 So show me the positive dominance。Hey， guys。

Thank you for coming to my place I hope you enjoy event You're sounding decent show me， okay。

 show me for a report。Hi guys。Okay， show me neutral。Hi， guys。Show me positive dominant B reportport。

Hi guys， I really appreciate you guys can you guys see some of the differences there。

 I't that powerful？Okay， give them a hands。Okay， we'll try a couple more people。

 I'm going to bring you up。You're going to just get crushier yeah。

 this is not going to be your breakthrough moment， but we're going to chip away at it and let's get two more people up that want to try you two come for now I'll get you guys after if you want okay。

😡，Once you start to see this， it's pretty intense。 Okay， show me， okay， get to the front。

Sand to the front， everybody the front， Okay， show me， show me trying for a rapport。 Hey， guys。

 how's it going？Hey guys， hey guys， how's it going， Okay， show me neutral。Hey guys， how's it going。

 show me breaking。Hey guys， how's it going So his range of expression is limited currently。

 The reason why is because he wants to stay it at the center， he's afraid that if he uses energy。

 he could be harmed or killed。 Okay， he's in a fear position right now。 Okay， okay， you next。

Hey guys， how's going？I love that。 Okay， next one。 Hey guys， How's it going。 next one。 guys。

 How's going。 Okay， can you see how much he's faking。

 Can you begin to predict which tone most people will match up with when they walk up。😊，Guys。

 you should be able to predict which one they're gonna to be in trying， neutral or breaking。

 even before they hit the stage。 there's gonna to be a couple surprises where someone who you totally think would have been trying is like crushing it。

 You're like， wow， I didn't see that coming very rare， but you will see it on occasion。

 but 80 to 90% you should be able to completely predict what it will be okay people of very high status will have a predictable tone。

 people of mid status will have another tone。 people of low status will have another tone。

 It's completely predictable okay you go ahead。😡，Hey guys， how's it going？Hey guys， how's it going？

Hey guys， how's it going？Do it again。Hey guys， how's it going again， next one。Hey guys。

 how's it going next one。Hey guys，Okay， I feel like the first okay。

 show me a very exaggerated trying for rapporty guys how's it going？Show me Ed， by the way。

 the blank right after is the cu that he's incongruent， Did you catch the blank after？

Look for the incongruent blink。 say the word incongruent blank。

 You could see he was like making himself do it。 He's like， hey， guys， how's it going like that。

 It's like it's a blank that you'll see right after。

 It means he was having to hold something that was false。 So that's why you have to be congruent。

 These guys that think they're to get better at dating by。😡，Not being congruent。

 just learning some trick。 Okay， good luck when you're doing your little song and dance and you're doing this overb with your weird voice tone and not projecting。

 That's gonna to work。 So， okay， show me trying for rap report again。Hey guys， how's it going。

 Show me， see it right after you。 Okay， now show me neutral。 Hey guys， how's it going。

 Can you put the mic up， Do me again， Hey guys， how's going， Can you put his eyebrows up slightly？

 Okay， show me breaking。Hey guys， how's it going show me。

 so the blink after that was kind of gradual， he's thinking it was decent。

The one that's fake is like that， the one you had to try like that。

 you'll see the resistance in the blinking。 Okay， okay， show me trying。Hey guys， how's going。

 Mike up。Hey guys， how's it going。Show me neutral， Hey guys， how's it going？Show me breaking。

Hey guys， how's it going。Okay， you？Hey guys， how's going？Really congruent， okay， gay， neutral。Hey。

 guys， How's it going， Also congruent。 Now show me breaking。 Hey guys， How's it going。

 So he can't even do the。 So he's somewhere， he's comfortable in trying and he's comfortable in neutral。

 We is decent。 He's actually very comfortable in neutral。 He can't even do the break。

 You're gonna to have to keep going， hey。Hey guys， how's it going， right。

 He has to play a character to even do it。 Hey guys。how's right he has to do that。

 right He has to play a character to get it。 You see that。 Okay， right， he can't hit that note。 Now。

 the reason you can't hit the note to be clear。 a lot of this is based on sensuality。

 it's based on mating。 So what happens is when you use projection properly and vocal tone properly。

 your mating opportunity shoot up。 Okay so somebody who knows how to use their voice。

 ever attractive people will just jump over to their table。 It happens all the time。

 You're sitting there with your friends， you're joking around and people who you'd want to meet。

 just start looking over You literally have to be like that and it'll just jump over at your table。

 It's crazy。 people that are like way more attractive than you are too。

 It's like really really crazy。 So what'll happen is that was almost my moment kept saying。

 So what'll happen is you're being blocked from doing that because now if do you have any environments in your life where you're like the king of that environment。

 Okay， what would those be I filmmaking love YouTube do you see how was the voice just changed right there。

Okay， you see that？So funny， okay。So crazy so what's happening is in his situation。

 just even memorizing that a bit， he'll go more dominant a little bit。

 it wasn't like wasn't like he became like you know Rammbo or something。

 but you could see a dominance， you know oh like hey guys how's going， hey guys how's going？Hey。

 guys， how's it going。 Tell me about where you're in control。 Okay， well anyway， you know。

 I just like immediately changes his voice tone。 So so much of the art form of meeting people of getting attraction of networking。

 socializing， making friends， all that social dynamics is the art form of caring that even when you're outside your comfortable environment。

 Okay， I want to be the same guy here in front of a room of people that have， you know。

 done me great service by being here。 I want to be the same person here as I am at some bar club where I don't know anybody。

 at。Maybe a meeting with somebody who I want to pitch them something。 I've got to be that same guy。

 So we don't just want to have what's called a situational confidence。

 We want to have what's called a core confidence。 Okay， say the word core confidence。😡。

Not situational confidence。But core confidence。 Now， what can be an advantage， though。

 of situational confidence。 it can give you a moment where you can experience that。

 So it can actually be quite nice to be in that environment where you get to be the king for a day。

 see how it feels。 But then you've got to sort of almost like if you took a hallucinogenic drug。

 And you realize the secrets of the universe and that the world is all love and。

 Well what you got What you got to do is。😊，I just know because if I go did to there。

 there's like so many people like don't， it's okay。😡，Back on track。

 So what you're going to do is like there's someone in here that did shrooms that like saw God and like they're like。

 don't you kind of said my shroom God so。But the idea being it not doing worse now。

Like a mob of people in my door pitchfor us like d， sh，Dig in the hole。When youre in a hole。

 stop digging。The idea in hallucinogenic drug trips is that you have this beautiful experience。

 then you come back to regular experience， but you try to remember that beautiful opening that you did have for that moment。

 And it can be a little tricky to remember it。 And that's why you got to keep doing his。

 So the point being is， okay， you know my fucking point。 So look。

 basically what you have is that moment of situational confidence that you got。

You've got to remember that， you've got to try to remember that and go back to it and imagine what it would be like to feel that。

 even if you didn't have that situation， even if you didn't have the new fresh haircut。

 the new shirt， the party that you're running the club where all your friends are there and so on and so forth。

 you've got to remember what that's like like when I come here and I feel confidence from running a room。

 I've got to remember what that's like when I go into regular life。😡。

So this a moment it's easy for me to be confident you guys are all here to learn from me。

 it's super easy， but I've got to remember that in regular life， in fact， if anything。

 I want to go in regular life and crush it even harder。😡。

And remember I said that we want to build an energetic body within you where you don't need that external feedback or that same person。

 instead of living from outside in， you're living from inside out。

 remember I said it's like you almost metaphorically want to be reborn。😡。

You are still living from outside in。 So when you're directing， oh， I'm the boss。 What so up。

 do this。 But when you're not getting that feedback。😡，You're being swayed like a leaf in the wind。

 So we've got to shift。That in you， okay， and creates something that is grounded in yourself。

 So the more that you get。Really great feedback， you get that great internet comment。

 you get compliments， you get validation， the more you're getting hooked on that drug of it coming from outside。

 Instead， we want to move within ourselves， get grounded。😡，Master our communication。

 master our confidence， master our energy work， and then from there it's outside in at least to a higher degree。

 it'll always be outside into to an extent you're a human being。

 you're engaging with the world so it'll never be completely different， but you see the idea， okay。

 hey how's it going？😡，Hey， how's it going， Hey how's it going， Hey， how's it going？A。How's it going。

 I didn't get that out well， but you didn't the idea， Okay。

 show me breaking rapport how's it going okay？You direct movies？Yes， can you see that？

All like favorite。 Okay， you see that。😀はははは。😊，Okay， see what he looks the most natural there， okay？😡。

So that's the situational confidence versus。Core confidence。 Okay， okay。

 now we'll put it one more time on you now， because we haven't cracked you through the wall yet。

 you're probably going the exact same thing。 but could you try a little harder。

 Yeah could you dig a little deeper， Yeah， could you dig a little deeper， Yes。

 Can you dig a little deeper， yes。😡，Yes。Yes， okay。Show me。Hi， how's it going？Nutral。Hi。

 how's it going and breaking？Hey， how's it going more？Hey， going look at that he went less。

 show me more。Hey， how's it going that feeling of resistance in your body。

 You're gonna have to fight through a man。 You're gonna have that feeling of like， no， no。

 I'm gonna mate， I'm gonna mate。 No， okay， you've got。 I'm gonna to lose my virgity。 No， okay。

 you've got， you've got to push through that， okay， okay。😡，Hey。Hey， getting better。 hey， hey。

 can you feel the resistance there？Right， so you've got to get it to where it just comes out smooth。

 Okay， Hey， hey， see that。 see how he's siling it。 You see what he's doing。He's like， don't mate。

 don't mate with me。 I don't know if someone's going to kill me if I mate。 I'm going to tribe。

 I don't know who the alpha is in the tribe。 I'm going to get killed if I mate。

Because if you're in a restaurant and you're like， ay。They're like， and they come over， right。

 so you're afraid of that happening。😡，Because what would you do if someone came over？

What are you going to do， What are you going to do？Well， now you wouldn't have an identity anymore。

 You couldn't be。You wouldn't be， you know the low man on the totem pole。

 you'd be the high man on the totem pole。 that would mean people might call upon you to be the boss。

 they might call upon you to be a badass。 How would you handle that？How would you handle that？

He might want it a little bit， right， Okay， right in the book， relentless by。Timot the F Grover。

 he talks about accessing that kid that doesn't want to be told no， okay， for a lot of us。

 we've got to learn to be more eharttolish， calm down， not not be so ambitious。

 relax for others of us， we've got to find that inner wolf and we're gonna have to work on that this weekend Okay。

 Hey， how's it going， show me that？😡，Hey， how's it going， I love that， show me neutral。Hey。

 how's it going breaking？Hey， how's it going Okay， you see， so he's moved down one， you see that。

 he's moved down half of one to one。😡，Show me the trying。Hey， how's it going Show me the neutral Hey。

 how's it going show me， okay， now did you see the slight looking at the ground after he went neutral。

 Did you see the slight shame in his eyes when he went to neutral after did you see it？

You got to be looking for this stuff， okay？😡，Waiake him up， he's getting tired。Yeah。Stit up。

 I'm gonna help you。 I get tired to you， bro ready late。 Which time are you like midnight。Okay，1242。

 okay， I'll get you guys out of here soon。 Okay， so， okay， so。

What's going to happen is you're going to see the incongruency there when somebody's out of their comfort zone。

 Okay， show me again the trying。Hey， how's it going？Show me neutral hey， how's it going。

 show me breaking。Hey， how's it going okay， make it， okay。

 there's a bit of an extra blanket of looking it down， it's very subtle， very， very subtle。Hey。Hey。

 hey。Ay， how's it going， How's it going， How are you doing， How are you doing，y， how are you doing。

 How are you doing， how you feeling， How are you feeling， how are you feeling， How are you feeling。

 How are you thinking， How are you thinking， Okay， see， he's getting it a little bit there。

 You see it， He's getting a little bit more。 Okay， give a hand in that desk's good， okay。So okay。

 you guys got the idea of it， getting a sense of it。 Okay， let's do that in exercise form。

 and then we'll do one quick exercise after then get you to bed。 Okay， so get your group， BR， N R。

 TR and congruence with it， go。语调在社交中传达的地位和界限呢，你们可以通过泰勒跟我们的一个群体性的一个演示看出来啊，上扬的语调就是试图尝试获得认同啊。

不经说了是缺乏自信和社交资源的一个表现。而下沉语调呢就是则展现出高地位和吸引力啊，你们可以试想一下，因为销售员总是用上扬的语调与客户交谈，他会显得缺乏自信和说服力，反而可能会引起啊客户的反感。

比如说哎你买一买吧，你买一买吧，你买一买相比之下适度的使用下沉语调能让人感受到自信和安全感，更容易赢得他人的信任和尊重，运用恰当的语调可以让你的社交对象啊，比如说你的伴侣朋友、同事等等。

他就更加的欣赏你。而上扬语调呢可能暗示你渴望得到他们的一个认可而他们不必对你投入太多。相比之下，下沉语调传递出你拥有丰富的啊社交资源啊，不需要他人的一个认可。反而。而会激发他们对你那个兴趣。

但是啊这些语调的运用需要根据具体的情景去而定上扬语调适合呢去表达善意，热情的欢迎他人的一个场合。而你希望彰显自己的影响力和吸引力的时候，请使用下沉语调，灵活转换语调，可以让你更好的掌控不同的社交场合。

因为人们往往被啊有界限的能量所吸引。过于给予认同的人，可能会被视为能量不足，所能提供的价值呢也有限，适度的界限感，能让你显得更有吸引力。还有就是社交互动中啊适度的挑逗和打趣呢，则是为了我们拉近距离。

增加感情的利气。但是前提是你要把对方视为平等的一个正常的人。如果说挑逗的目的是啊贬低对方或者是操控情绪，那就会适得其反。破坏我们这种人际关系的氛围，善意的挑逗应该是建立在尊重和欣赏的基础上。

还有一点呢就是语调的变化和我们内心状态的一个变化。当一个人。感到自信放松处于掌控地位时，他的语调自然就会流露出一种主导力和魅力。相比之下，如果一个人的内心恐惧不自在。

他的语调就会很难传递出那种自信和吸引力，语调的改变需要从内心的改变开始。真诚和协调形式语调训练的一个基础。如果一个人的语言和非语言信号不一致啊。例如他说话之后啊，不自然的眨眼就会给人一种虚假做作的感觉。

破坏吸引力和信任感。因为语调和肢体语言是展示自信的重要载体。当一个人内心自信时啊，他的语调会自然流露出从容淡定，肢体语言呢也会更加的开放和放松。相反啊，如果一个人的内心缺乏安全感。

即使模仿自信的语调和动作，也难以真正的去打动他人。因此，语调和肢体的语言的训练，必须建立在提升内在自信的基础上，还有就是核心自信啊，比情景自信更为关键。那什么是情景自信呢。

情景自信是一种依赖外部环境的自信。当处于自己熟悉和掌控的领域时呢，人们往往。感到更加自信，但是这种自信呢是有条件的。一旦环境的改变，自信也会随之动摇。相比之下，核心自信是一种发自内心的自信。

它源于对自我的认知和接纳，它不受外界的影响，拥有核心自信的人，无论身处何地，都能保持稳定的自我感和表现力。外界的认可和赞美，固然重要，但过度依赖他们，反而会削弱我们的自信和自主性。

当你尝试表现出VR的语气，也这种冷漠的语气时啊，让人明显感到一种内心的抗拒和不适，这种抗拒来自于对于示弱和受伤的恐惧啊，担心啊暴露自己啊失去身份认同啊，要克服这种抗拒呢，需要我们执面内心的恐惧。

去接纳真实的自己，从而建立核心自信啊。如果你自己已经尝试了很多次的脱敏练习，但是仍然没有什么效果。这个就要从你过去的一些经历或者潜意识中的一些呃东西去挖掘问题的所在。如果你有类似的一个困扰。

你也可以来找到我们，我们或许能够帮助。好了，最后呢告诉大家一个小窍门，就是在日常生活中啊，你可以根据不同的场合和目的去灵活的运用这三种语调模式。呃，在工作中在与上级沟通中用NR语调可以表现出恭敬和友好。

与下属沟通的时候呢，适度使用BR语调，可以展现领导力和权威性。而在社交场合中啊，与好友相处时啊，NR语调有助于经营轻松愉悦的氛围。刚与刚认识的人交谈时呢，VR语调可以形成吸引对方，彰显你的魅力和自信。

比如说在一些重要的场合或者是谈判争议场合。BR语调可以帮助你坚定立场，捍卫自己的利益。从而寻求合作或者达成一致时，NR语调呢有助于促进双方的理解和信任。啊。

总之呢啊语调模式呢就是人际交往中的一个重要工具啊，通过理解和掌握BRNRDR语调，并根据实际情况恰当的利用，你可以更好的表达自己影响他人。所以说语调啊它是一把双刃剑运用的得当能成为我们社交上的锦上添花。
