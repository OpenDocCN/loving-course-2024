# 33、谜男2.0：第三章：(24) St Tropez- Bootcamp - Masterclass Bootcamp Bundle

The problem with the player is he gets byer's remorse。Bires or horses where。The girl was interested。

But you've come on too strong， and now they're no longer interested。Did I have that sex。

To have the set that's on and because you didn't play solid game。

 you did not have her fall in love with you， instead it became a chase game。Horrible。Horrible。

 I've lost so many sets that way， you know， learn from my pain。

 so we're not going to do those four errors。Right。Starting in the middle， era one。

 starting at the end， era two， starting at the beginning and jumping over。Is an error right。

 and the other one is starting here and then getting stuck in comfort。

AndMoving things forward from here to here is around four to 10 hours。On average。

For its to turn into a sexual relationship that has sex born three times。If you only have sex once。

 it's a one night's day， there could have been an error in your pickup。If you have sex twice。

 then there was some sort of problem with your sex。 if you've never never have sex with her again。

 So you have some problem in your seduction phase if she doesn't want to have sex with you a second time or a third time。

 But if you have sex three times， that's a pattern。 and that's a sexual relationship。

 and that's the whole point in this playing solid game so that you get。Girl。

 because she's so damn hot。 she's worth。Doing this for， slowing the damn gang down for her。

 so it's four to 10 hours so if you're four hours in。系系。You're four hours in。You can slow it down。

You can actually slow it down， you can say， come on， let's go surf it。收件。

Hick the girl has to be worth seven hours。The good news is there are a lot of girls out there that if you really search。

You're going to find a girl who's worth seven hours of your time because it's fun to hang with the girl for the seven hours。

 by the way， just kissing and just touching and there' holding hands。

 there's just you rolling off first so she can chase you。

what if you feel like this little time you feel like just because of logistics。

 maybe she has to go back to she's on holiday and she has to leave the next day。We did four rate。

 when you went four hours， hey， I crush things。what's the B and the T and the M？Okay。

 I'm going to go through this。So you hear what the foggy errors are。

One error is shrinking this down too much。Right， and then you。

layerThe other is expanding it too much。 And then your fo， that's what you are。 you're a friend。

You've turned into a friend， it's LJBF， let's just be friends。

 you've been LJBF if you're over 10 hours。And if you're under four hours。

 you're compromising your comfort because you have to actually establish some fucking comfort and take some time。

 just your familiarity through time。Is strong。Interest。

And that's the proof that we as men have that we find them attractive。Is we spend our time with it？嗯。

That's proof。If a girl says， why me， why not someone else， you know you could have any girl。

Why have you chosen me and you simply？Can prove your sincerity that， for whatever reason it is。

You have selected spending time with her over anyone else。

 and the proof is in the pu of spending time。Yeah。Because we have limited time on this planet。 So。

 I mean， that is。That's what you what you thought them when say why why would you choose。

 would you choose me。我先。In general reply because sometimes I just replied that。好好听。

Because sometimes for the photos， when I ask a girl to take photos to come to see me and she say oh。

 but you could be talking to any other girl。 So why am you talking to me So when do I stay oh because I think pretty or I think you make a photographic subject Yeah this all there to it right if that's what you're thinking Yeah I' what I tell them It something Okay so now that we have done this。

This。Action。Comfort has been broken up。Where some comfort goes with seduction。

 some comfort goes with attraction because these are three physical locations。

 you've got your target rich location that happens during pickup。

Then you have to either time bridge them or bounce them。Time Bridge is where you get a phone number。

 we don't go for numbers anymore， but the metaphoric phone number and a reason to see each other again is two sides。

And that gets you into comfort。But notice there's a little comfort here。

 a little comfort here because this here。Is the selectionuction location。This here。Is。Your place。

And so you have to have a little bit of comfort before you move。

Into suction So now you know a time bridge is getting a contact info and a reason to see each other again。

 a balance is where it just bounced from one venue to the next right a lot of trust is established。

And this is the pickup location or the attraction location。 target， rich location。

 And there has to be at least a little bit of comfort so you have some compliance so that a time bridge or a bounce will actually take place。

 I'd rather bounce than timebri。A Tridge loop。Is also known as a dating loop。

And I hate the dating you because it's so freaking slow when you're putting a girl on Ros。

y phone on your phone， you know， you have a bunch of girls that you're hanging out with at the various times if they're free and if the girl's not free。

 well then you must move on。so that's a dating。And this here is doing multiple bounces。

You can multiple bounce the set。From。Location to location to location， more memories。

and then these are moves both the same thing here it's your living room and you're moving off into S1 which happens to the arousal dining arousal the gain however。

 is one in here。嗯。And this part here shall seduce you。Isn't that cool， Yeah， So this is open。

A2 is male to female interest， this is where I DHV and elicit IOIs while simultaneously nagging so that I can be permitted to DHV。

Otherwise it sometimes won't even permit you to DHU。

Next is the mirror opposite of82 hey that things shaking okay I thought I was doing that I was like well that's turkey。

 this is qualifying， you're going to qualify the girl， bait cook real release。

 and then you're going to move the set into the nearby C1 location made up against the bar somewhere where you can be locked in with the girls around you so you look cool。

The girls will feel like you're cool too because of it from there。

 you're in there for as long as you want to be until you go and bounce the set。To the local eatery。

This is the C2 location is like your car。When you're driving down the road in your car you're alone。

 you're not in a suction location， you're not in the attraction location but it's a good comfort location right that's E2 that's your day two when you're taking the girl up and you're bounce her now we're going to the mall and now we're bouncing to the Ferris wheel and now we're bouncing to however long you have to stay in here oh I got this ear another time right and you'll be trapped in this until you've accumulated seven hours where you can then。

第一手。To your living room。And it is from there， you then move into S1， S2 and S3。

 and notice it's just the beginning middle and ending to the beginning， middle and ending。

It just so happens there's also three different jumps and each one of these is a phase。

 this moves easy， but it takes skill。It takes skill to take a set that youve just met in three minutes。

 mesmerize the mon up with your body language and the rolloffs in such a way as to。

Have them accept when you sayHere come join me for a moment。

And you walk and lean back against something and they come and join you。

 we've built enough compliance with that little bit of movement and then you tell a story in that context and then you say my friends are here。

 I've been neglecting them perhaps I'll introduce you to them just don't be an ass come join and next thing you know。

 I'm getting greater compliance and they're moving to a backwards merging into a previously open set right hey these are my friends。

 this is Twele dumb， this is Twedle D， say hi be nice。

 we're surrounded by look tonight a little of love。I'll be back in one second。Now。

 within the context of having merged two sets， I'm already opening the third because I know that these people。

 whoever they are， have seen me in that moment。And that's what hes。Expit that moment。In the name。

Great， so this is open。This is DHD and nagging and eliciting iOSOIs。This is。Receiving iOSs。

 this is eliciting information so that you can IOI her back。

 that's what that is moving is so that you can get some compliance momentum happening because you're ultimately going to be doing a sit down takedown if you're going to go make out with a girl。

or at least push up against the wall or something， I'd rather be pushed up against the wall。

 by the way， rather than push a curl against the wall for the first time。If she's there。

 you could grab her， move her， and then pull her on。嗯。

And then you look cool because you don't want to rupture social value when you're in the clip。Right。

 so we talked about that。This is your seat2， yeah， you got it all， that's it。

 and this is absolutely brilliant。There's pickup midga end game and you could be great at pickup in mid game but if you're end Game sucks。

 you're still not gonna get the girl right the good news is it's well。

 the bad news is you can die your little Mario brother can die and any one of these phases like you could get a girl up to C2 where you had a date with her。

 a day too but then you never see her again。What do you think So what you do。

You've put another quarter in the machine because I've got lots of。 different than that way， right。

 you'll get lots of experience up front， like opening。

And you get less experience as you go down the road。It's otherwise a really smooth progression。

 especially near the end here， I don't want to get last minute resistance。Right， or if I do。

 I want to know how to handle it， I want to know how to minimize it。

 one of the ways it's seven hours， by the way。You know。

Because if you try to play man hands with a girl when you're three hours in and she's saying， no， no。

 no， it's going to be really hard to turn her。Long term relationship。A multiple girl。

 multiple sex girl。You know。So slow it down。Know that it is still only7 hours， really honestly。

Is a quarter a day。Thirdd of the day， quarter of the day。So there you heaven it。

 where do you think guys today failed the most？Well this is structure。

 so they can fail and structure， they can fail in material to fill the structure。

 and they can fail and delivered。So I think where they fail is getting out of the house， not trying。

 not knowing that they're structure， not knowing that it takes time hate over。

You need some DHV stories。You need some qualifier questions， you need to know how to move the set。

You need to have some comfort material。Where you're getting to know each other and make it interesting。

 so you have to have some games in there too， right you'll also be doing multiple groups。

While you're in A3 with one group， you may have to pause for a sec， merge a group in。

 and for them you're an A1 because you're dealing with the external intro。

What happens if you're talking to three people and two people arrive？Oh hi am， great。

 you have to take over and own the five sets in a moment， right？

So each of these has some material that you filled it in with， what do you do on your day two。

 where are you taking or？You know， some people are like， let's get together for coffee。

You were doing something and she can tag along with you I'm headed to the park to meet up with some friends and we're going talk business and talk pleasure you're welcome to tag along right I each in front of the XYC place and we'll walk through together just one example of the。

嗯啊。Living room， your place， do you have a high heel chew at the front of your。A wreck。

 a shoe rack you， no， a single high yield shoe。Right out front of your door， so if a girl comes over。

 she can see that other women have been here。just， a simple example of some of the info that's in and here's the real truth of the matter。

 there is so much material。And as such an art form to the delivery of A1 and A2。

A two filled with DHBs filled with the art of triggering attraction mechanisms。

 There's a love love that you have a relationship that you have with each of the phases。

 Some guys are stuck in a one man， They're stuck in it， but maybe some of them are loving it。

 they love opening sets。 They love opening sets， they actually do。 Most guys don't。 They hate it。

They have a bad relationship with A1， but hey， once they get to C two。

 they're fine right so you got guys that。Can open， but then they got problems with DHV with triggering because they're being nice。

 they're not actually breaking rapport and rebuilding it。

 and that's a part of A2 is breaking rapport。With one person， the target。qualifying。

 some people kept qualifying。How do they call how do they do it they don't。They don't welfare。

They get an IOI and they give an IOI。As opposed to woe， slow down。You tell me about yourself。

Make me interested， right， some people can't move the set， they literally move。

 move and the set stays there。And they're alone， and now they want to。

Rejoin it's the worst thing ever as opposed to lean back， talk about her if they can't hear you。

 that's their problem， I still have a story to tell。My value stays silent that way。

 and everyone's being weird。Where was it？四个人。The games。 look， I can fill these。

Each of these spaces can be filled。 There's so much knowledge。A wealth of experience。

For each of the phases， you know。Buncing。All the different ways of bouncing the step。

 where to take them next。And knowing that you're going to bounce them before you even to open the set。

Where are you gonna take？You know， because I mean， if you're with a wing man， then you might as well。

Grab two different groups， merge together and say heart is coming with us。And head to the next page。

 do two venues a night。If you guys do two venues a night if you go up。

 you should do two venues a night， you're going to bother phoning or going on。And。

Pning in that you're going to be there， you know， setting that up。

 taking the time through two venues。That way if the first one sucks。

 you can bounce to the next venue， that way the first one is awesome。

 you can bounce some of the girls to the next venue。你水。Right。

And what do I have to say about selection， there's arousal techniques。

I don't zoom that much into arousal techniques because most guys kind of they fantasized about all that。

 but it's the girls that are doing the arousing。好。The girls do berous， I mean。

 when you're when you've got comfort to the。Part of connection， that's what C3 is really。

 it's connection， C2 is trust， oh my bad， that's intimacy， that's trust and that wait。

 what are we talking about trust， connection and intimacy。That's what those three are。

 I was trying to say backwards。嗯。So here you've got intimacy and you've already established this connection。

I mean， you're literally demonstrating things in order to establish trust。This isn't like， you know。

 do they trust me， No， no， it's like doing specific demos， like for instance。

 if you hold her purse when she goes to the washher she comes back and she，First time。

That's a strong technical indicator of the trustworthy event or bouncing from venue one to venue two and arriving safely。

Perfect example of the safe。Proof that you were not just the leader of men because you had a group of people coming in。

I'm en right， but you're also a protector of flood ones。That's a hard one a demo。

 you can kind of mention it in a story， but it's hard to demo so if you can demo it with their lives that they're fine。

And S3 or S2 is less been resistance。Deal with that， and I've got thoughts on that。

 I've got a half hour lecture on that。And S3 is sense。

And I don't zoom into that that much either because by that point， the girl is taking away。

And there you have。嗯。That free care shows really and by steps there should be a topic in the university she changes and it's all based on beginning meals and edits。

Do you see the， skins are importants are what make the challenge happen right was in because otherwise the other game plan is where。

She gets convinced that I like her and the jig is up and now I'm here and now I make a move and she says no to it and now what？

Ca that's the other game plan that sucks， that's the game plan that you guys have been playing the other game plan is where you get her to chase you。

 it's more fun， you have to be more attentive you know， but youve had a hotter girl。

As for a particular type of girl， those9s and1s， they are hard to get。Not hard。 Sorry。

 they're not hard to get。 They're just different。You're different to get。And。They're harder to find。

 so they're harder to get good at。Right。You you got to practice on1s in order to get a 10。

We got to actually practice。Un not。In order to get hot her。

So you got to be willing to lose the next hot girl you find in order to practice material definitely that sucks。

 that sucks。 But you go， you go in saying that the next 10 that I find。That I interact with。

It's going to be my practice set on the tent， so I'm going to run you know the negging and see how that brings it on。

 you know？If you want us to do anything， cause you get talking important， you just tell us。

There's nothing to do to do no for example， you said it's just a small little micro demo I can roll the fuck off it's a day of letting them be us。

 They' dudes now。Let's go have fun with them。Right， and when the night time comes。

The their behavior will change。And they'll start。Making selections。And hitting on。

Let the girl do the sedus。 At plus comfort， equal seduction。 It isn' an attraction plus comfort。

 plus seduction。They will seduce us if they feel comfortable and attractive。

If there's something in magicians like a guy you mean you're talking to？不要证。Bs everything， right。

Yeah。You need to have that little bubble at some point， too。

 right you have little bubbles Yeah but also the roll arts are powerful because it's the time you're part Yeah that they feel like they want to get close to you。

 I saw the first fall up。 was like youre so interesting。 Tell me about， tell me everything。

And then like， did he just be？And then he came where like。So you不是。So the question is。

 if that's something you do consciously or it's just become harder conscious。 Yeah right。

 That's what I thought， too。It's just become a part of you。 Yes，It way of being。

But it's the right thing to do。嗯嗯。Yeah。Giving people the distance to chase you。

Isn't that a smart idea， How could you ever be chased if you don't walk away。

What do you do for example， because this girl she came again this morning now don't want to do anything。

 Shes like me。 second time she come here third time she here on my bed kiss third time。

 And then when I would try to touch just like no no， I didn't phone。

 but I rubbed up above the message on the And then we kissed on my bed she now she Yeah read theres a whole。

 last minute resistance。 No did I know about I've been doing like many times already doing she's doing this's doing this then goes I got a better idea goes like this sometimes because with the photos they're supposed to。

The way， the way it works is you say things like， touch me。To my skin。Right。

 you don't touch her skin。You take her hand， put it on your knee and let go。

You don't put your hand on her knee。 You take her hand and put it on your knee。 Let go。That's keyote。

Then you can say， can you cook， no， well， then get off。Now it's a joke。

 right I'm releasing seen this anywhere this is so important， this stuff is is so important。한금 that。

We her close， it's funny and important because from meat to sex。

 you have to push her off several times。How do you push your girl off that's not after？

That's the art。Is pushing a girl off who's not after you so that she starts feeling like she's being pushed away。

So， you must have value。So she tries to get you。And then she finally me wins。

 I felt like because I've never had at first like three years ago more resistance I had to do the moves and stuff。

 And now little told by little I felt like I was doing them and and also the game earlier was so good。

 So I felt girls now they don't wear it where they give me resistance even because of the photos about her she getting me resistance。

 but she was there So spending but two hours on bed， we kept talking。

 I we kept kissing from time to time。 but I felt like if some we just like okay okay no problem。

 And I went to get some milk and eating saless like this keep talking like I wasn't showing interest。

But I felt like she， if I just stayed， if Id even waited 10 minutes，20 minutes， she would be lucky。

Just not trying anything。 Maybe I should have you stick your hands or whatever。 I don't know。

I felt like if I did nothing， we would shouldn come back。 She was so weird。

I like saying this if for the hand holding， I want to try something。That's what I do。

 I want to try something in your hand。And sometimes they'll go。Right。あはは。😊，么。And they're like。

 what is that about？If they're not laughing， you're not getting hurt going。没有。

To it too hard than you did it。the whole thing supposed to be joking。Maybe we'。

 we're winning them over with humor or anyway。I don't know maybe you tried the serious thing。

 you know， well you may go sexual with the camera， but that's already later in the set。

 you're not opening with it， you know you're opening with fun， look at Bxter。

 look at however his demeanor is when women are around。

 he perks up and he's but he's just he perks up but he's just as silly。He'll do silly things。

 he'll go far you know all this stuff and it all works because later on they'll see him in a club and they'll see him demo andll him all decked up looking cool they know there's multiple bexters he needs to perform in front of the same girl to build a girlfriend multiple errs。

 you know， sometimes they'll see me decked out sometimes they'll see me acting like a baby not a baby but you know could you make me a hot chocolate play right sometimes they'll get me in manhood mode。

In charge of boot hand。Right， wordss。girlsir are secondary。

 we've got some actual life changing work to accomplish know。So I need the girls to see in multiple。

Characters and multiple clothing。Right。Like you look in a suit， you know。

 so I can see you showing both。 You have to show down。You have to show it because this is down。

 this is what that looks like right you're at the beach， but they also have to see you。

Sted out one time， you know， with that weird。see I need to take more pictures of this suit， though。

 But this winter， it will be the winter。 I' find some at least a ever jacket and what you do。😊。

Is the neat thing about tattoos。 And I'm sure you know this is some girls， they have a tattoo hidden。

 And what they'll do is they'll reach up and scratch for a moment。

So it reveals that she has a tattoo and then it disappears again。

They flash their tattoos so when you look at the time right。

 or when you reach out just this here will be seen right so when you reach out to get something tattoos will be seen and then they disappear again。

Just remember that。 That's a part of。Flashing DHVs into a girl right。

 because those are gonna bait her if she doesn't know you have tattoos because you're wearing a suit when you meet a girl。

 Re out， grab something so that she can see that。 Then she'll ask about it。 Then you take the。

You get to take coat off and create a new look for her with the tattoos。 you know。

 if you remember in Paris at this rather than reveal it all is what I'm saying。 right。

 you want to reveal because you've got more on your body just one hand， one hand exactly。

 but she has to win you taking your shirt off to see those so she shouldn't see you the first time。

With your shirt off， because you've revealed all your。

Things that you want to do when you're lying in bed and you want to say， this means this。

 This means this go check my body out， Take the shirt off you're lying in bed。You know。

 then you can explore your body with her， right， don't reveal it all at once。

Do you remember in Paris strip or youre wearing like gler。 Yeah， and the stripper sheet。

 I saw you you were like telling her about took it off because she asked me Yeah。

 because she asked me yeah。first yeah， my worries was like oh first， you have to pay for club。

 If it's a nice club， then it was expensive。 But like I did so I didn't even bother going。

 And now we went we went together and then actually some clothes are free have to some clothes free clothes were free And then theyre free。

 but people they w to let in exactly rather choose the people letting So it's really about how you go up to the bouncer and how we how it feels about you whether to know whether it's gonna let you or not。

 So one of the game plans William was very confident hey I'm here again even if you've not therey I'm here again okay they don't w to take the risk I sort of if I'm still moving forward I don't wait for their like he I'm again I keep slowly moving for not running in。

😊，And when we were in， I spoke to who I thought would be like the head there's always the head sort of organizer in there yeah or dormant or whatever。

 And I said to him， hey what's the best way of bringing my entourage in and I pointed I happened luckily the has outside with the very expensive yardsch What' I want to bring my entourage in next week？

😊，So what's the best way to do that， because I don't really want to go through the website because they annoy me。

 I'd like just to speak someone personal。 And you seem like the coolest dude in the place。

 Do you have a card。 And then they give the card And I was like。

 what's your name And he's like Julian， evens on the card I like to do that and Rob really get a connection going。

 And then later on when I leave， speak to the people that are really on the door。

 And then and then go out and say， hey Julian said you're the perfect person to speak to about getting in next week with my entourage。

 Do the whole thing again。 But you've now name dropped the main guy in there who works there to the main girl on the door。

 And now you getting all these connections。 And we ended up with a ton of business cards of all the places we went so。

Says VIP rooms。 And how do you say that one Go you Yeah。

 that was the name of the the last one that one。 That's alo。

 So I don't know if that's gonna pick up on camera。 He he's even got his picture on that。

 He's pretty cool， dude。So we've got them now。 and we can when I go to the door next time。

 I'll pull them all out。And I'll be like， yeah， yeah， Julian said to， you know。

 I'll be fiddling moving them like we go everywhere， exactly。😊，Everyone was very responsive。

 we were part in and when we went in one bar or club， I should say。We we did hired gun the game。So。

 but  first of all， I went to the， I thought the prettiest。Model that work there。

 hired a gun that worked there to be beautiful and dart around the table。

 And I did like a little hideaway trick。 And she smiled。

 And then I went back And then I did I went to high5 And she went up like I pulled down went no it's a secret。

 Do a low5 like that And then held her hand for a bit。 And I went I gotta go。

 And then we went through a barmaid she' like， how can I help you she's like we only do bottles。

' we don't have beers on the menu。 if even though I do sometimes And then she， And I was like。

 I need to know what it is like that we're looking at it。

 And then we DH and ourselves talking to her a bit。😊，I said the same thing about the entourage。

 That's a good tip for you。And， and then I sent you inca English wasn't exactly perfect。

 even though she got most what I said。 but I can then move away as if I'm not now asking but you are。

 So I've left you to it。 Yeah， and you closed on on Instagram。 and what was that all about。

 Tell us about that。 I just， I just ask her if she had Instagram to offer to to offer her to do some photo。

 Actually， not this girl。 I just， I just gave a you Instagram。 That was the second one。

That was the second that you opened about now the barmaid the barma themaid。

 I just that's the girls if they want to do photos because girls to the photos。

 it's my photographer game。 And I just before some photo shoot for the girls most of the girls then love to take photos。

 So I just oh you have Instagram。 can just if you like them shoot together And so I just always take Instagram like within one minute But the key I think the good bit it was busy bar because it was you know a place beautiful women working and go to you can't just go up and you can't go up to behind the bar and say Instagram we LED up to that point DH the way we're acting she must flirt that works there I'm doing fake social proof。

😊，Tending to wave like， yeah， be， be there in a minute。 hi， Yeah， you know。

 all that stuff you see me do all the time。 Yeah。 and they don't know that there's no one over there。

 or there's a group of hot girls。 You don't have to know them， right， It doesn't matter， right。

 You're just waving while someone is looking at you。And。

Then we went and announced to listen the next one。 We got that that details。

 We didn't need to buy a drink。 We to the next one。 This is the third bar now。 And on the third bar。

 what did you notice， It was the。It was the two girls standing near the door。The third bar。

 Do you remember the spin， I did the spin， and I put around。 room back with room。 Yeah。

 and I did that。 the hide again。 Yeah， And I was like， oh my God。 And she's like， what。

 you look just like my sister。 And she's like， oh my God， really， what I said， yes， she's coming now。

 actually， And I want to picture of you both together。

a she like Then I pulled William in speak French to her because our English was a bit broken。

 And I was saying to you what to say to her and I was like oh William， how rude of us。

 you should invite them to to the house to the party and so on。

 just right after then high five span the closing with her we didn't get film So when I I'm looking at the other one equally beautiful smiles like And then I shook kiss my own hand And then I did theid awayid away away which great that。

 they always laugh。 And then as I shook their last one's it's been emotional and she was like， yes。

 its lovely。 And now we have to Yeah they love it。😊，So， and I realized these clubs。

 they are no rude guys。 So if you open， the girls are receptive。 you know。

 they are all nice because they are no rude guys。 They are more nice guys that doesn't dare to approach then theyll know you don't see any rude guys。

 So it's a high hand club， so。We will show you her on this tomorrow because I've sent a request now。

 she put it in the phone， right， but you gave a mind， you put it in the phone。 again， I stepped away。

 Your wing man is important。 He can come in and help with that。 And that's why we do it。

 And the same with Williams closing and he he's got a target that he wants to chat to。

When the closing happens， what you do is you call me in clothes and I close for you。

 Yeah and it shows that， well， it's getting someone else to take the number for him。 Who is this guy。

 That's why it works doubly well。 And I was like， have you met William and you came in So and you you're not really。

 you' you're a day gamer Yeah you hardcore day game。 I've seen it。 you've done amazing things。 And。😊。

Now usual the dynamics of the club game yet And， and I think a lot of people。

 even very experienced club promoters would struggle in the clubs that we went to tonight because most of the hot girls there are hired guns。

 They're paid for their beauty to be in the club。 And you should see how amazingly beautiful they are。

 Al right It's just。😊，So everything's possible。 You just gotta know how to do it。
