# RSD泰勒《蓝图解码2.0重铸蓝图》：5.情绪感染力：训练前言_ev

这里是社交光谱，我是莱特，欢迎来到泰勒的20年的精华大课蓝图解码2。0关于课程的最新的一个更新动向，以及你想要获得更多的一个链接，请关注我们的公众号社交光谱。我们会在研讨会群里面不定期的进行直播答疑。

那么我们来开始今天的一个内容。接下来大家可以看到泰勒给我们的两个练习。🎼这个群体的练习呢就是在帮助我们去打破表达中的限制，学会用声音语调和情绪来传递信息，而不是去过度依赖具体的内容。

大多数人啊在公众面前讲话的时候，要么显得很刻意，要么投入的精力不够，要么过于注重内容，要么尝试用一些夸张的方式来吸引别人的注意力，而真正的解决之道，就是要学会自然的运用声音和情绪，赋予内容的感染力。

我们来看第一个群体性练习，学会如何以一种专注于能量语调坚定和氛围的方式说话，而不是担心内容本身的一种练习方式。

So what we'll do right now is we'll go into our first exercise。

 we've just led into this and what I want you to do is I want you to learn how to speak in a way where you're focused on the energy and the intonation and the conviction and the vibe but not worrying about the content and what we need you to do is learn how to release that block in your mind that you have to have the perfect thing say we've got to release that block and we've got to get you talking and talking。

 well this is going to do， it's going to do a few things for you and we're going to be， by the way。

 we're going be stacking these exercises they're going to be stacked one on top of another so it's going to be a lot of like。

😡，Karate kid， Mr。 Miyagi， wax on， wax off， I'm gonna be getting you to do things that are a bit ridiculous。

 wax on， wax off。 But by the time that you combine these together， just like in the karate kid。

 he's blocking， he's like I can't this is crazy right I'm gonna be getting you doing that。

 So these exercises are going stack and get you doing this。

 And the end result is that you're gonna be able to talk into a video camera。

 say you want to be an ambassador for your business， say you want to walk in and try to get a raise。

 say you want to make friends someone， say you want to date。

 you're gonna have unlimited things to say， but you're also going make a major impact。

 Okay a major impact。😡，So let's begin。 What we're gonna do right now is go into a video。

 remember what I just did there。 What we're gonna do right now， right。

 we're gonna do right now is we're gonna to go see that I would start the video there。

 What we're going to do right now is we're going go into an exercise where you're going to describe your drive here。

Now， if your drive here was highly entertaining。😡，We're not going to do that。Instead。

 pick something else and you can pick whatever you want。

But I want you to try something like your drive here or something boring。 And I want you。

 And so you were here last time。 So you probably did the drive in。 So you should pick something else。

 What is something boring that you could pick so that it's challenging you because if you're picking something awesome。

 that's too easy。Okay， flossing。 that's perfect。 So you' never done it before。No， no。

 have you ever done flossing as this exercise？Okay， so that'll be great， so makes me wantan to do。

 I'm kind of jealous so what you're gonna do right now is you're gonna go into an exercise where you're going to describe whether it's flossing。

 whether's your drive here， and I want you to take about two minutes each and I want you to use speaking with passion intonation。

 conviction and energy， and then I want you to lower the bar of how good or relevant the information has to be lower the bar of how good or relevant the information has to be okay lower that bar。

😡，And what will happen is you can literally just free associate and talk about anything like flossing。

 you could talk about the feeling in the gums， the speed of flossing， the pros and cons of flossing。

 do you floss before you brush after you brush， what is the thickness of the flos。

 you want the wax on the floss， do you want that smell on the floss。

 is it smell somewhere chemical that's actually hurting your teeth or is actually helping your teeth is is there fluoride。

 is the fluoride good for you， is it kill brain cells。

 there's different debates on its in the water system， how often should you floss。

 what happens when you that time that your teeth are bleeding， you have to floss through it。

 what your dentist said， the way that your dentists flossing， do you guys see what I'm going here。

 the way you feel about flossing， what flossing says about life in general。

 the way you do one thing could be another thing。😡，You see what I'm doing here。

 You can stretch this forever。 It's literally unlimited。 You just relate。 the world is so big， right。

 So you just keep relating everything about the world and then just keep relating it back。

 It creates unlimited content。 Remember， in the content game these days。

 high frequency posting gets you more subscribers and followers。 That's the way the algorithms work。

😡，Quick last side point about this Back in the day， I created this program。

 It's called the blueprint。 If Who here has ever seen the blueprint， but your hand up。 Okay。

 I've created this program called the blueprint， Who's ever seen Ho seat at home， put your hands up。

 Okay， so I created these programs， right， Ho seat at home in the blueprint。

 I spent years working on years and years and years。 This program I spent years and years working on。

😡，But my videos， I do off the cuff。😡，Now， when I did the blueprint。

 that was an experience where I spent four years on one four day seminar。

 and it was a beautiful experience making it perfect。

 but you want to know what I realized in the day and age of social media。

 if you're spending four years to create one piece of content， basically to the regular world。

 you are dead。😡，Most people think that my mentor mystery doesn't teach pickup anymore。😡。

 he's gone now， right？Excuse me， hello。He's doing nothing different than he did before。

Why is it that before he had a website， he was a teacher。😡，And he taught they。What's changed？

Nothing changed， He's doing the same thing。 He's still doing what he's doing， he's still around。

 Everyone's like， he's gone， he's， what do you mean he's gone， Did he die？I mean。

 at some point he will， right， but not at this moment， he's riding around。

 how did anything change at whole， but yet what is most of your guys's opinion in my mentor？😡。

You guys think he's dead。You guys literally think this guy's dead。最後。

He doesn't spend 90% of his time making free content for me， he's dead。😡。

So when I realized at a certain point， little Wayne was blowing up back then。

 you guys remember when Little Wayne was in every collab， so I used to like it more like Dr。

 Drray or E&m where they would craft an album， they'd write every lyric。

 they'd polish it down to perfection that's who I admired Little Wayne to me was too free associative It's like he' just drink a bunch of coding and then just start blathering right but the thing was what he did was and he'd go on anybody's guest star I'm like why is he could to just go on any track that's weird here's what he did。

😡，By lowering it from a perfect 10 or a 9。8 to a solid 8 to 85。

 he was able to master the art of coming up with an 85 in three minutes。😡。

E&m on one song is going to spend if he's putting out an album every two， three years。😡。

If that album has say 20 songs， he's spending about a month per song， one month， one month。

 one month per song。 Little Wayne drinks some syrup。😡。

She probably hurt his health very badly has health issues， but you know he drinks the syrup。

He lets the other guest star the person he's guest star want to make the beat。Do the distribution。

He was guest her on everything， right？Now his rap might not have been quite。

 and now it's arguable you might like his rap better than Em&M。

 but his rap might have not been better than say Em&m who spent a whole entire month or two months on a song。

😡，But it was still very good， you know， depending on your taste， but to a lot of people very good。

 that's undeniable， popular right So then what happened was he was able to be out there all the time。

 So Ebonm's been gone。 Ebonm's been dead for three years。 Little Wayne is omnipresent。

 You can't literally every channel is Little Wayne on this guy's song。

 Little Wayne on that guy's song。 Then he goes and puts out the Carter3 blows up。😡。

Carter4 almost as good。 then he had a label dispute。 That's the problem this is Europe。

 all the being all whacked out， him and his boss， right， the bird man， they had their challenges。

 okay， say no to drugs his kids， but they had a great run。What's going on there。

 It was the frequency of release。 Learn how to master improvisational speaking means that when social you do your social media。

 you can put out a solid 8，5 every day of the week if you want。😡，Now， if you want to do a 10。

 I've done a 10。 It's called the blueprint。 It's called hot seat at Home。 It's called this seminarar。

 This seminarar is going to be a 10。😡，To me， but what I'm saying is。

How long did it take to make this， I can't make something like this every day。😡。

Because this has so many iterations， I've reshuffled this and played with it and tried the different aspects for impact so many times。

😡，This seminar is probably。😡，It's about one decade in the making。

 so to get what you're going to get here this weekend， it took me a decade to come up with it。😡。

To get the free tour， the seven hours of content I recorded yesterday。I didnt one sitting。You see。😊。

But that seminar yesterday is still a quality aid。😡，Nothing perhapspped。 And by the way。

 here's where it gets weirder。 Let's add on to that。

 The seminar that I created yesterday is the quality 8 of my potential。😡。

But that seminar yesterday because I speak so much。

I's probably at a higher level than most people's paid programs。So it's an8 for me。

 Why is it at a higher level， What do you think。Because I teach all the time。

When you teach all the time and create content all the time。

 your throwaway is probably going to be better than the person that just sat there working on the one thing because you're just releasing all the time。

😡，And heres what's funny。 This is a Seth G concept。 Seth Gin said that in R day and age in marketing。

What we should be doing is we can't be like， like mating like in this like monogamous。 like。

 this isn't real， but just in as a。Any for business， he said。

 we don't want to be mating monogamously raising the one baby。

 We want to be more like a dandelion shooting spores all over the city。😡。

And out of all those spores that you shoot out somewhere。

 there's going to be a little dandelion that will grow up from that。😡。

What he was saying was if you put out piles of content。

 you don't know which one is going to be the one that blows up out of all the content that I put out。

 the videos that did a million plus views， it was always the videos I didn't think it would be。😡。

It was never I was never like this is going to be the one that gets super popular。 In fact。

 the ones that I like to mull are probably a little bit denser。

 they actually are usually less popular。 So the more content that you put out。

 the more likely you are to have that smash hit that goes viral。

 If you're always creating and releasing and stuff Goy calls it shipping， just say the word ship。😡。

He says，Creators， ship， say that。Yeah， you shipping all the time。 You're just in momentum。 See。

 my great musical idol is Dr。 Drray。 But then Kanye West came out and Kanye was one of the first people that was just always making tracks。

 right， Dy was so much better than Kannyye for a long time， so much better。

 But I believe that Kanye went past D。 I though Dy was the innovator， because Dy just kind of。

 he just wasn't shipping。 He got out of the habit of shipping and just releasing。😡。

You want to be in what's called shipping momentum， say that word shipping momentum。

 Okay so in the same way with say meeting people， if I'm not meeting people all the time。

 I don't need to do this perfect scripted way of meeting people。 I'm going go out。

 I'm gonna improvise， I'm gonna have fun， I'm going to meet a ton of people And what's going happen is if I'm just meeting all these people all the time。

 I'm gonna wind up meeting somebody， they're gonna like think I'm the best person ever because I just met so many people If I'm putting out videos putting myself in front of tons of people It's gonna be a lot of people that don't like it。

 but some will。😡，So it's just， it's just say momentum。 say the word momentum。 Okay。

 so let's dial back then again， full circle。 So this exercise right now is just about like。

 look at the mindsets that I'm instilling in you here。

It's not about getting the perfect description of your drive to work。 It's not about that。

 It's just get that quality8。 It doesn't need to be like。

 you can write it out and write out a whole script on your drive here and then change the words around and did it。

 Or we could just kind of run through it and just sort of see how it goes。

 You could just kind of quickly motor through it。😡。

And see how it proceeds by just speaking in a way this kind of charismatic just putting an emphasis on the charisma and being free associative by me doing it this way。

 I knew that I could make unlimited content for the rest of my life and here's the best part。

 by the way， I can still do the once every three year project too。😡。

I can be doing my improvisational content for YouTube or social media。

 but I can still dedicate several hours a day to that perfect passion project that I release once every two years or three years or five years。

😡，When I did Hose at home， I worked on that for almost a decade， and when I did blueprint。

 I worked on that for four years， I was still working on that while I was releasing my  eight out of 10 content。

 And then like I said， when you're always shipping your version of an eight，😡。

Is another person's ten because you're doing it all the time， you're in momentum。

 you're going to become better at what you're doing。😡，That other people anyway。

 my version of meeting someone say there's someone I'm attracted to。 I want to go meet them。

 My throwaway version of an approach is better than most people's ones that they planned。 way better。

 by the way， Why is that， Because I'm approaching all the time。

 My version at this point of a throwaway approach where I barely talk。

 I don't even do that much is going create more attraction in most cases。

 than the person that SAT at home thinking about it all the time。😡。

So it's like the momentum is actually makes life easier。🎼The momentum makes life more fun。

 and you always want to be in that momentum。 Allright， let's track in the exercise。😊。

🎼如果说我们放下对信息质量的一个过高的一个要求，允许自己啊自己由联想天马行空。泰勒以使用牙线为例啊，他从牙龈的感觉讲到了使用频率，从牙线的厚度讲到了上面的辣和味道，各种各样的东西。

所以说只要给于放飞思维。一个看似很简单的一个话题都能够引出无限的一个内容。当你不再拘泥于事先准备好的内容的时候，而是敢于相信自己的直觉和感受的时候啊，你就能很自然流畅的表达，也更能打动观众。

即使有一些想法可能不够成熟或者深刻。但是这种活力啊本来就是一种感染力，泰勒曾经花了4年的时间啊，全心投入创作这个蓝图这个项目，力求尽善尽美。但是这个社交时代的来临。如果说啊你花了太长的时间去创作内容。

可能大众就不认识你了。很多人啊认为我们的祖师也迷喃啊，已经退出了这个呃教学其实并非如此啊。第一个练习方式已经看完了。接下来我会给大家分享第二个题练习。
