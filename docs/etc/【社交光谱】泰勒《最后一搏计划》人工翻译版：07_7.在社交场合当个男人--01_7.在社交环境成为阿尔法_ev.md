# 【社交光谱】泰勒《最后一搏计划》人工翻译版：07_7.在社交场合当个男人--01_7.在社交环境成为阿尔法_ev

I despite doubt I can triple a referee tell by my attitude that I most definitely from。

🎼These streets。🎼You feel。🎼为来。🎼Thankよ。🎼一万个豪剑。🎼阿没出汗。Ch me up the exit。天に。🎼的演。I love。😊，🎼。🎼Govervin。

Can you take me my friends hey what up going from real social dynamics。

 we're kicking it in a rooftop bar in New York City tonight and what I want to talk to you about is what I personally feel is the single most defining quality that makes you a man and I know what you're thinking。

It's not this。It's not this， believe it or not。It's even not this， okay？It's engagement。

 it's responsiveness to your environment， it's being fucking awake because the vast majority of people are in a sheeplike days and just looking to others to decide how to adapt how to respond but as a man。

 your job is to add value to situations to add a fun safe vibe to situations and fundamentally to respond and adapt to situations that is the opposite of dirping around as most people are doing and it is the definition of being a man today's video is about rocking it as a fucking man adding value。

 fun and adaptive responses in any environment that you go to that you bring forth with you that masculine vibe the big thing environment is responsive right and awareness。

😡，You know， I got my student here， he's dancing with this girl， people are taking a naps。

 we are having fun。And I look around to myself and I say， you know what's happening around me。

 how can I offer value to this environment， how can I offer fun。

 how can I be aware of what girls even want to talk to me and so coming me you know。

 so I can come from here I see a girl over there。わ。🎼没。は有。🎼かもしれ。🎼もし。🎼What's your name？

Where do you come from？ここ。Yeah。I think I love you。Yeah。In the pocket， that okay？🎼This is。Okay。

I guess。so cute let's kiss before she comes。こ。I've been a New road。あそできあてよ。俾都几百一你嘉边。

Good can you take me my friends can she fit。滚。Be engaged。Offer value and adapt。Good morning。

That was the fun night to boot camp last night， can hear my voice a little bit scratch up。

 that's what happens when we're screaming all night and just crushing it and what we're going to talk about like I was saying。

Is a very， very critical distinction that you're gonna make in your mind about what it means to be a man and this is gonna to be a very。

 very unusual video because rather than showing you a specific technique about how to be successful with women。

 this is really gonna to be a video about life Okay so picture this you're talking to a girl it's like the last girl tonight she's actually a very pretty girl she's got two dudes that there's four or five in the morning you know you're on a stoop outside on the street。

And like 10 people are watching you when you're doing that and you're talking to them。

 there's going to be some nervous energy right so the guys are getting nervous， they're like do that。

 this is weird， what's going on and I keep trying to call the group to come in， I'm like hey guys。

 come in， come on in。But no one wants to come in and what I realized in that moment。

 I kind of have a sense in my mind， what do they need。

 what do the people here that are watching me need， do they need to watch me pimp this girl。

 let's watch how oh and pimps the girl， the technique that he's no what they're lacking is basic manhood and what that basic manhood means in my mind it comes down to three simple factors one。

An instinct to offer value into any environment okay as the shepherd， the mayor， the leader。

 the caretaker of that environment， guys say， what。

 I want to caretake you caretake people because women sense that vie from you that you're fucking stud。

An instant to offer value。 The other ones to offer fun。

 Our role is men is to make environments comfortable for all who are around us。 But in general。

 when you walk into a room， your frame is I offer value and I make those around me have fun and feel comfortable And lastly。

 I kind of just broke it down to three simple ones is the importance of responding to the environment as is changing So when the people are watching me talking to the girls and they feel the discomfort。

 they feel a shift in the energy， the instant that I really love to see is how can I offer value to them。

 how can I make them feel good， how can I make them laugh feel comfortable。

 how can I adapt And if they just simply come in and said hey what up guys make everybody laugh how fun now all of a sudden those guys could have been friends with us。

 the girl could have come unless we get out of fun time Okay so what we'll do。

I we' cut to that clip and it's just a strange clip。

 It was something I've never seen in like 15 years of doing this。 I mean it was really very awkward。

 but it was also a great teachable moment， so lay back， watch the clip and I'd suggest you。

 by the way， to refrain from judging it because to be honest I'm to predict you that if you're there。

 you probably would have done the same thing and again just to remind you。

 normally a boot camp it's a very small amount of students but some extra fans it kind of jumped in and the crowd just sort of built up as it really happens just sort of a unique incident but a very teachable moment so just lay back watch this teachable moment and ask yourself what you would do differently as far as offering value as far as offering fun and adapt into the particular needs of the environment with your frame as a man。

Whatd you get？P。I just came out to the prettiest girl Where you fromt girl came from where you from I just came from had to go and you guys。

We had a lot of fun in my voices shout out we were screaming and going fucking that's a sign。

 it was a good night though。Yeah。Look at these pants， I live in my mom's basement。

 smoke weed whack off and play video games tacos ninja game。inja the best yes Ninja。

 I have very strong thumbs， I'm like it's a very old game。は。Oh。It has a sandwich。Yeah。

weirdsThese guys yelled them， call them yell weirdos you guys like I just tried to break off from you and these poor guys are like frightened the shit。

Why are you just standing there just say hi or just yell high or like you know how scary that would be to have 10 dudes staring quietly or I think I was going die yell high or right away somewhere It's called social acuity Social acuity。

 Social acuity， Why are you standing there social social acuity now you look away。

 you can't just look what you have to either say hi， You got to say hi， you have to go away。

 there's two options's two options。WaitW do you have to leave me you should marry me I knowt I have a weird policy chasing me you can't just sit there with three people being like。

So it all it was the weirdest shit I've seen in my life in 15 years of boot camp。

 this is the weirdest scenario I've ever seen， So either， what do you do， option A， say hi， option A。

 say hi， option A， say hi， option B， get the fuck away， Okay。

 you can't I can I can't I will challenge one of you to hold a set that long。

We're fucking this squad like this like。Okay， that took more focus。

 I had to focus so much to dos are all going， What's going on。 What is shit。 I'm like， no， no。

 it's cool It's quite Okay， What is the word though， It is a more important lesson here。

 Theres a much bigger lesson here。 What is it， What's the lesson。Social acuity。 What's the lesson。

 guys。 What's the fucking lesson， Social acuity， be aware of scenarios and respond to scenarios。

 Don't just allow things to happen and just be like， I have a What's that on boot camp， Okay。

 the point is， Social acuity Only be somebody who adds values in the situation。

 Only ever add value in an environment。's like he's all mad。

 Why don't you just make him laugh like add value， make him laugh in the move rather than being like。

😡，No。Okay， so add to the laughter， add to the fun， add to the what Add to the what we should always be adding what good Okay so that's the mentality。

 have that in your mind。 That's why I crush I crush because I am always adding value。

 I'm always adding to the fun。 It's instinctive I'm sure you notice that was very cringeworthy and it really just reflects that on a program we like to hammer it out until the bitter end So I'm trying to offer some extra value is the last girl that I can see to approach so I go for it and really in that moment when I saw that the students weren't able to adapt to the changing energy and to the discomfort that was being caused by that group and you know particularly the people。

 the fans that were seeing it taking place， I became very passionate and the reason that I became passionate is because in my opinion。

 this whole disengaged mentality of dirping and not offering value and fun and adapt into environments。

 it causes too huge problems the first one is students who bust their assets putting a lot of hard work to try to。

ProveBut they don't get results they're out there。 they're trying to get better with women。

 but they're not getting the results they want because they're not coming from a frame of being a man they're coming from a frame of being a little boy in arrested psychological development and not interacting with the world as a man and then trying somehow to crush it with girls。

 which is pretty rare but the other reason I'm passionate about it is because that whole dirping phenomenon is what causes horrible things like genocides where people get into the sheeplike environment and some charismatic leaders like cur people get up now。

 they are a different group that us and what winds up happening is they just listen because they're in the sheeplike mode So one thing that I've always said for my own children is I don't care what my children do in life It doesn't matter to me what my kids do they can do whatever they want but I want them to be engaged I want them to actually be engaged with what they're doing and to interact with the world is men。

 I want them to be men， my sons。😡，who offer value， comforting energy and adaptability into their environment To me。

 this is so critical because when I seen grown men that aren't coming from this frame。

 I'm going to tell you the truth， it absolutely scares me。

And the reason why it scares me is because I realize that there's going to be a lacking of an authentic life。

Funny example that I give a lot of time。 I was at a gene store one time。 I pulled out 1200 bucks。

 I said， hey， sir， could you bring out some genes for me， maybe this type， He went to the back。

 He didn't have a specific type。 And so rather than bringing out some other genes。

 Or rather than maybe making me laugh and opening my mind up to other possibilities。 He just said。

 oh no， we don't have the jeans。 Let me walk off。I remember thinking to myself。

 do you think money grows on trees。 Some just pulled out 1200 bucks to try to buy something from you？

 You couldn't adapt。 What else could you do。 And so what I think about these environments is what else right So for example。

 that gene store guy， He could have maybe walk back out with other jeans。

 He could have walk back out and got me laughing and kind of converse with me It maybe openminded to browse in the store Maybe he could have got some girls in the environment by being adaptable and say hey guys。

 what do you think his jeans。 What do you think would look good on him。

 There's so many things in that gene store guy could have done。 And then if he could get that down。

 maybe in a year from now or five years from now， he wouldn't be working a fucking gene store。

 he'd be crushing it。 So I don't mind if my kids working at a gene store。

 but I do care that they offer value， Fun and adaptable energy to the needs of whatever environment And that is what matters to me And so the same thing goes for women right You know that girl walking up the street。

 Do you just sit there Blithely going Well I didn't it work that't work or do you say hey。I'm a man。

 How to offer value to her。 How to offer comforting energy to her。 How do I adapt to her movements。

 maybe slow play a little bit。 maybe spark up her emotions and then do a hard stop。

 maybe spark up her emotions do a hard stop and go for a kiss。

 maybe she needs me to kiss to feel at ease Maybe she needs me not to kiss Maybe she needs me to pull back。

 maybe she needs me to do a takeaway， Maybe she needs me to show that I'm not into her What does she need What does she need and what's important is that you feel that flash of inspiration of what she needs and offering it her How are you able to do this because you're not so caught in your head。

 being a sheep looking what other people are doing and you're aware what you're not trapped in your head and you're out here in the present moment。

 you're fucking aware。 you're sitting there as a man coming to her as a man with value comforting energy adapting to her knees and when she feels that as you lead her forward she knows that you will lead her to the promised land pleasuresure Oh and arm。

😡，Oh where are we going well these your friends right I just' want to break you as apart hi I'mna we know each other from before what I'm doingy On。

Yeah， how do you guys meet kidd how do each other me and you， also we were in kindergarten together。

 you don't remember No kind I't like in kindergarten。Yeah。

 we played in the bricks I hated bricks I know that was the problem。

 That's why we haven't seen each other in such a long time You do are you from the Midwest No where do you come from。

This is your pose Yes what's I doing Oh no these but very nice for you to be very polite。

 I where you from Los Angeles really New Orleans is a place haven't been and I really want to go You having fun I walk you there good How do I add value。

 How do I add fun That's why always in program when guys because guys get up。

 It's a room of 400 people right And it's about making everybody have fun。

 So like I'm like who has questions and they're like get up and they start whispering like I a farm in Iowa and I need to know how to girl behind a tree。

 I'm sure all other 400 people are gonna get great value of this right what do you guys think is the problem with mindset。

 What's the problem with it if I answer， to thinking about themselves if I answer that question am I hurting him or helping him。

Why why am I hurting him， I fucking him up， It's like welfare baby。 Now， some people say， well。

 he came ask this question。 Yeah， dude， there's 400 people there。

 ask a question everybody can gain value from。 The problem is。

 if he's in that mindset of wanting a handout， then the next step is that he goes up to girls wanting a handout So I've got to have him in emot。

 How do I add value to this girl's night， how do I add fun to this night。

 But I come in that frame everywhere I go when I walk in a room， I just like I walk in room。

 dude and I'm like。😡，You know， like， that's how I feel when I walk in a room。

 So where I go out and I eat regularly or where I go out regularly。 Everybody's like， it's owe it。

 It's owe。 Now， the girls that are working there want to have sex with me。 They want to date me。

 They want to come to my parties。 They want to meet my friends because I'm coming from my。

 I'm not walking in this weird little mindset。 And I'm like， little creepy troll。

 staring at people and shit， wanting stuff from them， wanting stuff from them。

 which will get you what。😡，Which will get you what which gets you what。

 what's it get you when you want shit from people， what's it get when you want nothing and offer fun and value to people？

Everything， what's it get you？Louder， What's it against you that is as you can know What's it against you Great。

 So be coming from the frame of offer value Off fun your environment when you do that paradox。

 you have more fun。 so that's more energy right now。

 Me you guys but I'm offering the fun So it's an instinctive。

 instinctive situation where you always want to offer value and fun。

 So if you see a situation like that where you know because we decided to merge the boot camp tonight right we're having fun。

 we merge this all together and we're having a moment it's the end of the night where you can watch me a bit just be aware of what's going on Okay and be like。

 okay， they' add some fun or back off a bit and look from further away。 but have that as an instinct。

 if you see people getting uncomfortable， offer value， make it so they get comfortable， be like， oh。

 there's discomfort here comfort。Energy out， energy out， not energy in energy out。

 so if you're not having fun out your boys， that's an issue。 Okay。

 if I'm out with my boys thinking quiet， I start fucking tickling them in shit。

 I get everybody laughing okay， everybody having fun。But it depends if you want sex or not。

 What is sex ultimately， women are attracted to potency， potency， There's a what is potency。

 potential scene， Okay， potency， So they see， are you a low energy or high energy person。

 Then you could be chill， but at least you're offering energy in the form of the chillness or some cool vibe。

 but not introversion or value taken okay。😡，This I'll be quiet out anyway， No， not。 No， no， no， no。

 quiet。 no， no， don't you even。 me quiet。 No， me quiet。Okay， yell， yes， yes， yes， jump up and down。

Jump in。Okay， no， but I'm doing it to make a point right it's like look if we're gonna merge all the groups together right now。

 then why are we doing this because you it's like what about my buddies。

 that's how we do it look I don't always call like that all the time if I on a quiet night I choose a quiet night。

 but here's the point either go out to crush or go home or go out for a quiet night except that it's a quiet night except the results of that will bring but't I don't know what so you got to make your choice you have to be honest with yourself about what you're doing be honest with yourself is this behavior leading towards me crushing it or is it leading towards me going guys that try to learn about success with women and don't get success they're not honest with themselves like I thought I followed this they're not okay be honest with yourself about how you nice progressing that's why I said each little move that you do be aware of what's leading to what is me beginning to open and engage and have fun and add value and talking to everybody is that gonna lead to me going home with someone tonight or am I gonna to sit here in my introverted shell now if you can crush from an introverted shell do it you don't need to do anything I'm saying if you guys are crushing it just being quiet。

And just like looking for somebody to give fun to you create， I'd love to learn from you。

 I'll take your program like show me the one where' like go quiet out and like can I have some sex？

RightAnd and then the girls are like yeah， you know， I love that， wed all would right。

 but at the same time ironically we do have more fun when we offer value ironically。

But you actually do think of it like this。Be aware when you go out in your night。

 be aware of what is affecting what。Be aware of what is leading to what。

Be aware of are you adding fun and adding value， are you taking and not adding value。

 are you introverted stifled where are you at if you can pull from being invertedent stifled by all means I'm not trying to change that。

 but if you can't and you've seen better results of getting out there。

 getting into flow and engaging in generating opportunities。

 then ask yourself what behavior will get you in the generating opportunities if you're more tired。

 then crank back fight back against in opposite direction that makes sense。He look at。

 look at what I just did there。 I said did that make sense and how did everybody answer minimal energy。

 You're still not getting it， Does that make sense， Does that make sense， Okay。

 so which which person has the more potent sperm in the girl's perception。

 The guy that goes does that make sense And the guy's like。

Who has this firmer that's going to make thousands of generations of grandbabies？

Does that make sense？He has the sperm。When I say， how are we going to get there？

I don't mind it you don't know， but I want to see you like thinking about it maybe pulling your phone out。

 I want to see some you know some gears moving in your head all right so you see I'm giving the students a bit a hard time here and I'm doing it with love and funny enough I gave him a little bit more shit actually right at the end when I said whenever you' gonna go eat and how are we gonna get there and funny enough I noticed again that that strange kind of quiet vibe of Drping came up again and I gave him a little bit of shit about that too I said hey。

 if I say how are we gonna get there your job as a man is to go boom come up with something。Now。

I really want to emphasize here that it's of no importance to me whether or not a student comes up with some place to go and eat。

That has very， very little relevance to my life I can figure I have a phone It's also not that important to me if students you know make some guy laugh or not。

 it doesn't have a big relevance to me， it's not that important to me if students offer value to situations but what is important is their success and I understand very clearly that unless they're going to grow up as men it's gonna be difficult to have success no matter how much technique that I offer them so this is where I sort of realize that last element which is adaptability to situations okay as a man we have to empathetically feel into situations and let a flash of brilliance come to us of what that situation is so as a man you want to be that person who feels into situations。

And it just comes to you what that situation would need， everybody just claps or everybody goes。

 yeah， that's awesome， You're the value offering guy you're able to feel into it Now。

 why do we do this look as a man？We do it because there's a soothing masculine vibe that this offers and as a man。

 we can walk up to different women and just by talking to them and having that vibe。

 we absolutely crush in ways that you wouldn't even ever expect there's the difference between grounded potent energy and ungrounded scattered。

Potent energy that's discombobulated， So there's still the grounding aspects， Okay。

 but so many guys like， I'm grounded。Yes。That's not grounded。

 that's introverted It's more important to be someone who's aware perceptive a leader there's more important lessons here like I can show you say this or do this。

 but then after the program when a girl walks by in the same way that if I say how will we get there and you just look dumbfounded it'll be the same thing a girl goes by you'll technically have the knowledge how to do it。

 but you'll be dumbfounded you guys catch you this you guys catch you this okay I want to show you something really simple just about how I even took a photograph for a couple。

And just notice that simple model of offer value， offer fun。

 and feel into the situation of what they need。Feel that and then notice how that interaction。

 just taking a simple photograph for a couple making them feel good。

Goes into me going into the next interaction。 You guys are a really cute couple too， Yeah。

 you really are Are you guys going have kids at some point。

Are you guys going to have kids at some point but I'm like I'm messing you guys that's a tough conversation it's good to meet you guys。

It's a beautiful picture， once like one more， this is definitely departure from a typical video I'm showing you infield footage of me taking a photograph。

And a lot of guys are probably saying， well， why do you even want to take a photograph for a couple。

 let like fuck the girl or the guy give me a hand job。Well。

 how does this transition will watch this immediately after taking that photo？

🎼I'm mean that frame of mind。 that's in good value， fun and a daable frame of mind。 a girl walks by。

 and it's a nice smooth open。 Let's watch。 How are you doing thank you Where do you from friends where are you guys I have go downstairs I can't go home with you Okay。

 cool Nice smooth open And what does this lead to I go back to my students and I gotta take them out to the streets and show them how to adapt and what you're gonna to see here is how I quickly adapt into situations once I'm hitting the streets and when I do so。

This is where it pays off girls coming up highly responsive， highly responsive， okay。

 so always be aware of the dynamic changing environment okay， so this one blew out。

 they didn't hook it， maybe we could hook it， you know？Pleasure， oh in arm。

Oh where are we going these your friends right I just't want to break you as apart Hi I'm know each other from before I' doingy Owen how do you you guys like kidding how do we know each other me and you also we were in kindergarten together don I like kindergarten。

Yeah， we played in the bricks know I hated bricks I know that was the problem。

 That's why we haven't seen each other in such a long time You do。

 are you from the Midwest No where do you come from。你好。

This is your pose here Yes what's sub dude Oh no， these but very nice for you to be very polite I'm where you from Los Angeles really New Orleans is a place I haven't been yet and I really want to go。

 You' having fun life is a complete I where my I think we're I'll walk you there hug night good night and that open there I'm adapting to the environment is changing and what happens when that ends and I go into the next interaction Well this is where I pull miss。

Nice to meet you Hi What's your name Nice to meet you Oh who are you here with I don't know no one you're kidding me No you make cute facial expressions you make cute facial expressions。

 but your lips are kind of dry， are you okay。Oh Rachel you're completely the friend of ours we've known each other for actually like nine years。

Not really but。You want to go， if you did her， we can go completely okay。Can she did use that okay？

No you want to go back we're actually back。We are completely dying。主这人。W， you guys是喝。

you said you're pussies you don't anything like what pu why do you say that why do you say that pu pus。

 why do you they' pussies， they do nothing。One about。哦 yeah。都好系。뭐い。Rbers。Cool。

 wasnn't that nice And because it's a boot camp， I do have to quickly run back to students。

 This is the end of the night as well。 We just went until the very end。

 I love to do that on program go at the very very end。

 but I go back and then explain that to the students Now you're in the environment。

 Now this environment is great because it's so dynamic。

 There's so many different things going on and。You have a choice in each moment So the first choice is what are you gonna do another choice is what are you gonna feel another choice is what value are you gonna add I can walk up。

 I can engage people hi there like I'll just talk to anybody I talk to that group that you guys saw over there in the street I just immediately go up。

 I feel that I'm giving them the publishers clearinghouse check and then the next ones that went by immediately it's like oh boom open。

 then her friends comes her friend might be blocking me so I immediately engage the friend then I mean like like then this one's saying maybe she wants to go home if you go home you and I can go have a bite and now she's like yes。

 I want to go with you So I'm seeing the situation and respond respond or respond and respond now I'm responding from a place of fun and offering value not trying to take something I'm like waiting and go it's a different vibe Some guys are probably like well I tried that thing where I suggested like it didn't work What's a vibe behind it So basically think of it as if。

As you。As you're engaging。You want to be aware of exactly how each step is leading towards the next step。

 so when you're in that venue， you've got to ask yourself what decisions that you're making。

What are the choices that you're making at how is each choice affecting the next choice could you guys probably be honest with yourelves and say。

You want to know something？I know that there was like a girl I was about to start talking to I didn't do it。

 I got in a worse mood， and then I made an excuse on another girl， got in a worse mood。

 made an excuse on another girl got in a worse mood。

 and then by that point I was so deep in the hole of a bad mood that I forced myself to do an approach and then that bad mood carried into that approach which got me our rejection。

You know， right yeah， and then and then eventually what happened was you got enough rejection。

 you said， well， I'm just gonna to push it anyway。 you got enough rejections。 then you stop caring。

 you got a little bit of momentum and then you start having fun with everybody next year everybody's dancing。

 Do you guys notice how everybody tonight was all dancing with different girls partying with different girls We had a couple students poll How did you guys feel being in a big party group like that just like everybody having fun at the energy building you enjoy it how did it feel to have like that group vibe all back there and like the girls that's like oh this is pretty cool a place where I could Yeah and then they can meet each other you can merge groups and so that's the energy that you want to be creating。

 getting that up and up and up look at how by doing this we generate opportunities to meet women at a rapid pace So a lot of guys you say Tider to meet women or they use online apps and that's how cool too but we're able to go out and generate that just in person as that builds。

What's happening is your night just gets better and better and then opportunities generate。

 so that's what you guys saw me do tonight was， you know。

 build my mood over the night and then give myself options for polls and then winding up pulling those two girls that same mechanical act of like words can not your mouth。

Could that be done in a a ley way Yeah， because you care if you care， they know。

They know that you they know that you're trying to extract something out of it， look。

 if I'm coming up to you and I'm trying to get something out of you， can I hide that？

It's the same with the silent open you can do the same phase。

 but the eyes are wrong Yeah the silent opener， no talking works because they can feel if you want something or not so there's nothing that he can do if he's trying to has some weird creepy selfserving agenda there's not a lot he can do to hide that from you。

There's not a lot that someone can do to hide it unless you're a really scammy， just sneaky。

 really effective， sneaky guy， which I guess you could be to an extent， but。

You know with a woman that really attun to it so it's like you're just there that's your friend you know and it comes from abundance right because a guy who's already seeing other women and there' with lots of friends and successful he's already got what he wants so he's just laughing having fun at what's up What are you doing over here Who are you？

What are you about， that's cool。Your need， I want to know more about you you know right like because you already have what you want。

 meanwhile， a guy who has nothing and he's putting a big deal on it they're like oh God。

 he's putting making this huge deal and the girls even the hotlands are like I'm such a dork dude。

 stop putting me on my pedestal。 they know they're like dude I'm such a dork。

 stop treating me like this is's silly。Keep it real。Make sense the major distinction of this video。

 I try to be creative with every video and。There's probably a lot of disputable stuff in it。

 I would imagine the comments in this it would be pretty interesting。And a lot of people saying。

 why do you have to have fun， Why do you want to comfort people， Why give the students hard time。

 there'll be tons of comments， so then I get that。But。I would hope anyway。

 this is why I'm putting it out that you can see a deeper point here。

 the point that I'm trying to make is that as a man there's a way that you carry yourself。

 you carry yourself in a way that offers value to situations that offers fun。

 comforting energy and that adapts to the needs of that particular situation。

 those particular people and that particular environment。When you do so。

 the payoff is that women sense that vibe coming from you and they feel very attracted to it and they feel very good。

 This is a vibe that you can cultivate regardlesss of how you look regardlesss of how much money you have。

 This is a vibe that you can choose to cultivate because you're a good person and when you're a good person it fucking pays off a lot of people out there will say。

 oh you know the bad guys get the girls bad boys get the girls you know the bad guys finished first。

 nice guys finish last I say fuck that good good dudes finish first and being a good dude like I said。

 it means offering value offering comforting energy and adapting to the needs of the environment and when you do that。

 you cultivate a great abundance of positive energy in yourself。 you know that you're the man。

 you know that you're awake， you're not a diper， you're not half out of it。

 you're not in a fucking trance， you're not seeking approval。

 you're not looking to others for what to do you can take feedback but you're not looking to others like a sheep and you become that man who is awake who's engaged and the type of man。

 the society relies upon。 Now we start off this video over there at the freedom tower and as you're aware there was a terrorist。

😡，That was there many years ago， it was devastating， it was disgusting。

 it was horrific and there was I'm sure many people who were afraid and ran away。

 but what was beautiful about that was that there was many people instead of running away。

 ran towards that fucking tower and those people you want to know something they did something heroic that day and they showed that there's something in all of us。

That can actually step up into situations can feel and feel what's needed and that's why now I want you to think about that and think about what they did and think about which type of person that you would be in a situation like that and hopefully you never are in a situation like that and I hope that situation like that never happens again but what I do hope for you is to carry yourself with the pride。

 dignity and joy of being a man and being the kind of man that offers value。

 comfort and adaptability into any environment Anyway。

 I'm crashing out we had a lovely night out thank you for sharing this beautiful New York evening and morning with me。

And I'll talk to you soon。Peace。🎼回。
