# 【社交光谱】泰勒《蓝图解码2.0重铸蓝图》标准班：06_14.驾驭能量：破除与人相处的紧张和无力感--01_14.驾驭能量：破除与人相处的紧张和无力感_ev

Yeah。我是社交光谱莱特，那么我们继续蓝图解马2。0之旅。更多的精彩内容呢，请关注我们的公众号。社交光谱。这节课呢我们来讲一讲大脑给你的一个限制，以及我们大脑运行的一个具体的一个工作。

那么我们最近呢也在翻译我们最新的一个新课，叫最后一搏。如果说你真的想改变自己，你必须要下定决心去改变你要开始去消化每一节课。你要明白，释放自己才能获得魅力，释放自己，你才有能量。

我们要去学习如何真正的去驾驭这种能量。比如在一段互动中，谁在乎的更多，谁就会更无力。在本节课呢，泰勒教会了大家如何破除跟人相处的那种紧张和无力感，那就是大脑需要证据，而不是承诺，那这句话什么意思呢？

就是当你的大脑需要熟悉周围的环境，他需要一段适应和验证。而不是你空洞的想法。那些想法会阻碍你前行。其中泰勒告诉我们啊，你要多跟人去接触，啊，无论男人还是女人，最主要的你可以跟男人去接触。

通过跟他们的一个交谈，你能获得自信，你的脑袋呢就会形成一种印象。什么印象呢？就是男人对你其实是友好的。比如。🎼你去试图认识一个女孩，你和女孩交谈的时候，你会被恐吓。为什么呢？

可能你的恐惧啊被恐吓的缘由是，哎，如果其他女孩子喜欢你，那么这些其他的男人啊会过来攻击你。其实我们去跟人社交，重要的不是是社交形式，而是一些社会性条件因素啊制约了你。由于我们的社会性条件制约呢。

你的思想长期被禁锢，并处于一种长期恍惚的状态，你活在别人的标准里，你活在别人的社会性制约里，你一直在寻求认可，寻求反馈，你的内心就会充满匮乏。那么匮乏这个词是所有一些情感问题的源泉。

那么我们在蓝通解码2。0的研讨会里，会做一个专项去跟大家分析匮乏。We're going to into our exercise and sec。Give a big yawn。All right。

 have a seat。 Okay， so we're gonna crack back on curriculum。

 What I generally do every day is to wake myself up。

 I'll rant for about 45 minutes to an hour at the start of each day just to wake up Once I wake up。

 that's when the genius kicks in。 Okay， so that's why I rant a bit at the start of each day。

 But you can just enjoy and lay back。 Have a seat。So let's review then what we covered。 See。

 can you feel me waking up， by the way， Can you see that I'm gaining energy from this。

 I am drinking tea to be fair， But you know my point， so。What we have is the first exercise。

 which is separating the content from。The emotion。 Okay。

 did you see how I did that in my descriptions。Okay， another one that we did is cadence， cadence。

 vocal pitch， vocal tone。We did that。 The other one is projection， as I was getting to before。

 in projection。Here's how it works。 What I'm going to say is probably the most important lesson of this event。

 Okay， what I'm going to say right here。The way that it works is that。We are tribal animals。

For better or worse， tribalism can also be one of the most disgusting aspects of human nature。

 It creates racism and division and war， but。It also creates positive sides to it。

 It has pros and cons to it。 Okay， in a modern society， tribalism is very bad。

But but could be good in some cases， too， because it could create a family vibe， which is good， too。

 So what you basically have is we're part of a tribal or're part of a tribal group。

 So I want you to think right now， the sum total of knowledge that you have in your minds。

And remember， we said yesterday， think about the ingenuity and creativity of your dreams。

 Remember that， the creativity and ingenuity of your dreams。 Now， when you look at your dreams。

 what does that mean about your potential to be creative and what does that tell you about your brain's potential to create new images and ideas at an incredible rate。

At a ridiculous rate， Think about the rate at which your mind is generating new ideas while you're dreaming。

 So I look at you who I've worked with， right and。😡。

Wheres the guys pick you who have've been picking on all weekend， right， And when you have a dream。

 how creative is your dream？Okay you're still not。 by the way。

 if you want to really come out of this event cracking it。

 you've got to make the decision to start internaltizing each lesson。

 You know that I'm gonna crack on you for not using your vocal tonality， right。

 So you've got to start using it more。 And what you think is loud is not loud。😡。

What you think is screaming is normal。 What you think is screaming is normal。 Do you understand。

 okay， show me， say thank you， Owen while screaming， watch。Yeah， screaming me， thank you O。Thank you。

 Owen。 Okay， that's pretty good。 He's getting Give him a hand。 He's progressing。 Okay， now。

 by the way。😊，I'm going to get to you this。 You're still in your control muscle。

 which means my voice， I'm using less and it' going to the back。

 it's going way back to the back the room could go across the street。

 whereas you're trying super hard。And it's， and it's like moving a bit。 Okay， so I'm nice。

 but not nice。 So， okay， but you get the idea there， right， So you're still。

 can you guys feel how I in my release muscle right now， And he's in his control muscle。 Sa。

 say thank you， Owen， say it as loud as you can。😊，Thank you， Owen， loud as you can。 Thank you， Owen。

 Thank you， Owen。Look， I'm barely even talking。 Who's loud。 stand right here。Yell to the crowd。😡。

Thank you， C。 Thank you loud as you physically again。 Thank you。 Thank you， C。 Who's louder。😊。

I'm going very soft right now。This is as soft as I can go。This is as low as I can go。😡。

This is as high as he can go。 You see that。I'm in release right now。 So it just。

 so the energy is moving completely differently。 Have to see it。 we'll work on this， okay。

So you're still in the control paradigm。 I'm going to get you out of this with exercise， okay。

you trying to be funnyty or anybody trying to be funnyty from the control paradigm。😡。

At their very hard disability。Will'll be about 10% of how funny you could be in release。

How do I know that， because I can look at you and make you laugh？😡。

For somebody in control to get you to laugh like that。

 they're going to have to really think of something sharp in release， I just give you a funny energy。

 and you're like， and it's is going to hit you。 You've got to understand we're not just looking to be 10 or 20% better than everybody else here。

 We're looking to be thousands of times better。😡，Okay we're going to such a different paradigm here that it's blindingly more powerful like it's like if you're a human in the water with a shark fighting a great white shark。

 you're like the shark just like like that and you just split in half This is blinding power。

 what we're talking about here okay， I want to show you how to harness literal electricity。

 blinding power。😡，Okay。Yet， ironically， to harness it， you have to not care about it。

 So that's a kind of funny thing。😡，Like what I'm saying to you。

 you're going to be one of the most powerful people in the world。You're going to care the least。

You're going to view the whole thing as ridiculous。The whole thing will be utterly ridiculous。Okay。

 it's like if you look at an ant colony and the answer like gotta get like over to here。

 and then you're like。But the ant wants to get over here so bad， right。

 it would do anything to get over here。 And then suddenly， you just mutate into a full human。

 And then you just do walk over here。But that， that objective is so small that you don't even care about it。

 Like， it doesn't even have value to you anymore。 Having massive power is not even very valuable to you。

 It's like， okay， like you're almost like， a。I'm， I'm one of the smarter ones。 This sucks。

 I wish you like， you'll wish you'll become one of the more powerful， smarter people。

 but you'll wish that there was people that you could look up to more。

 And that would tell you what to do。 And they were smarter than you。 You don't saying， right。

 Like it's like， oh， I'm one of the smarter ones。 Oh， no， we're in trouble。I don't want this。

 you know， right， like you'll wish that you could be the diper。So。

So it'll have very little meaning to you， so ironically that I'm going to show you how to get what you want。

 but in the process it's going to have very little meaning to you。

 the whole thing is going to look ridiculous' it's like if I showed you how to be cool in the ninth grade。

😡，And like now you can go back to the ninthth grade and be super cool， but you're like， okay。Party。

 party， you know right， go。 So， so that's what it's going to take。 Like to get to that next level。

 you've got to understand that when he says hi。He's trying a thousand times harder than I am。

 but feel the way the energy is moving from me。But he cares so much more than I do。

 He cares a thousand times more， but has1 thousand times less power。You see that。

 That's where have you ever heard me say clarity of intent plus freedom from outcome。

 You have to want it like 1000 out of 10 and not care 10000 out of 10。

And then when you merge those to bang， that's where the reality happens。

 That's where the genius kicks in。So the lesson， the most important lesson is this。

 we're tribal creatures。 What does that mean？So let's say that we're about to go hike through a dangerous forest。

And there's somebody there who knows more about how to hike that dangerous forest than me。

But maybe I'm a little bit cocky on myself， right， But I'd be better off to just listen to that person who knows more what they're doing。

As a survival mechanism， my brain will shut down and I will become a dier。 I'll become a dier。

 And then I'll just start looking to that leader to tell me what to do。

And then he will lead me or she will lead me or whoever will lead me to the promised land。Okay。

 she will lead me。 That leader will lead me to the promised land。Now。

 what's going to happen is that to the leader's mind， they're going to switch on。

 So nature is going to make it where all their faculties wake up。Here's how I figured this out。 Okay。

 you're going to find this funny。So。When I was learning social skills。

 you guys know what I mean by social skills， right， When I was learning social skills。

What happened was I， I was going and approaching people and having fun approaching people。

 So say I would be out in Who years ever been to say Austin， Texas， You ever been in Austin， Texas。

 really fun place to go out。 You got to go out on dirty 6。 It's like way too fun。

 It's like the nastiest ro。 It's like you just rolled around the mud。

 like you're five years old rolled in the mud。 It's just's the most fun thing in the entire universe。

 Basically， you go out on dirty 6。😊，The nastiest most fun thing you could ever do。

 So the dirty6 is like is like a street with like， how many bars are on6th Street。

 Can you guys guess， like， is it like 100 or something。😊，It's a lot of bars， whatever it is。

 it feels like hundreds， however many it really is， I don't know。 It feels like hundreds of on them。

 They're all in a row， too， in this big wide street。

 And theres there's even police on horseback and they kind of go through。

 and then they they crap on the ground It like。Yeah， so。Everybody's just partying。

 it's like Mardi Gr basically every day。I learned a lot there。

I learned a lot in Leicester Square in London， too。 So anyway， you go there。

 It's a little bit like meat packing would be here， but way crazer。 Okay， like in the streets。

 but way crazer。 So what I would notice is when I was young。

 I would go out and start talking to people Now， if in a certain environment。

 let's say that I were to talk to。This group of people here。 Okay。

 so now everybody in my area I talk to you， and they've been nice to me。 They receive me well。

All of a sudden， I'd start to laugh。 I would just start laughing at my own jokes。

 I'd feel really good。 I'd become very talkative。 The words were on the tip of the tongue in the same way that I'm talking to you now。

 not thinking at all。 Please pause and consider I'm not thinking at all right now。😊，Like this。

 this appears like a canned speech， right。But it's just coming to me。

 I'm going to show you how to do this。 It's just coming to me。I'm not thinking at all。 And yet。

 the less I think the more power I'm harnessing。 the more electricity I'm harnessing。

 And this is me after speaking for several days and coming off a product。 I'm exhausted right now。

 By the way。 about as tired as I get。 I woke up today。 so inflamed that my knees were hurting。

 My ankles were hurting。 My voice is stolen shut I was exhausted。 I've been doing a product launch。

 You guys see the product launches coming out this week。

 I had to work like around the clock on a product launch。 I have it ready before I take this trip。

 finished it an hour before the flight。 and then came here。

 and then now I'm doing I did a seven hour free tour now I did yesterday， and I'm doing this。

 I'm gonna do two more days after this。 And then I'm gonna record more。

 And I stayed up until what time today recording。 Anyone see my ice。

That was the start of the recording。 So， yeah， so look at that。 It looks kind of crazy。 right。

 Anybody that was out with me yesterday is like， how's this guy doing this right now， This is crazy。

 Well， what's going on there。In this environment， you guys are all here to hear me。😡。

So what's happened now is I'm getting this benefit of you guys feeding me the authority role。

 You're feeding me the authority role。 So because of that。

 I'm getting full access to to the sum total of my intelligence right now。

I'm getting access to all of it。😡，Okay。So because of that， it will appear like I'm smarter than I am。

You're as smart as me。 you may be smarter。 if you're less smart is' probably not by much。

 We're all in a range of each other probably， but here's the main key because of the simple fact that I have full access to my intelligence right now。

 I can come up with things very， very quickly， Do you guys see that very。

 very quick on the tip of the tongue Now， by the way， as a social media influencer。

 how do you think this helps me to create content。😡，What it means， look。

 do you have unlimited dreams， yes or no？Well， if you're a social media influencer。

 do you have unlimited content， Yes or no， Of course you do。 So I'd be going into it。

 which means you can have a higher output of content。😡，Now， funny enough， you guys don't know this。

 I recorded for five years， but I saved my content。 You know why。

 I saved my content and held it back because YouTube is cracking down on content。

 I have five years of content that I can't release on YouTube because they crack down。 There's like。

 you just far the wrong way。 They'll call it that you're a。😡，I I can't even say the word anymore。

 I'm freaking out。 Yeah， basically， you fart the wrong way on YouTube。 Now you're banned。 Okay。

 so I literally created content for five years。😡，I spent about 4 million to create five years of videos。

 Can't release it。Okay， I'm done， okay， so anyway。Yeah， I have entire。

 I have I have a closet with four  TBaby hard drives filled floor to ceiling rows of it that I can't release What I'm gonna do。

 I'm gonna release content that I can release now。 And then I'm gonna save the content that I really want to create。

 And I'm going release it when I'm 80。 And then fuck everybody。

 That's what everybody' is gonna have to do now。 That's just how it is。 So yeah， crazy。

 but I'm gonna I'm gonna to take a lot of action on this issue too， I'm not a lame duck。 Now。

 but I'm not gonna take action on YouTube and get deleted off it。 So the main thing here。

 what we have is a situation where the full subtotal of your intelligence。

 We use this for social media influencer status or whatever。 How did I figure this out。

 Let's get back to that example。😡，Okay， so I'm been Austin， Texas。 I see a group of people。

 I walk up。And because I'm getting a good reaction， I start feeling really good。

 But what I noticed was in my own self observation was as I walked out of that range。😊。

Into this other area， I could feel my brain shutting down。Why is that。

 Because you have environmental confidence。 So what would happen was I'd be in this area。

 and I'd wind up making out with like 10 people。 It was crazy。Because I'm so confident。

 And then I'm just like， hey， what's up。 yeah， Oh you know，2 at a time，3 to time。

 You've seen the videos， right， It just gets crazy because you're so confident And that was great。

 But then I'd walk over this one， I'm younger， now I don't deal with this really very little。 Now。

 walk over here。 And I start second guessing myself。 I start stumbling over myself。 And I'm like。

 why was it that over there。 It didn't matter。 So what I say is that the brain needs was called proof not promises。

 say this with me， proof not promises。 So what'll happen is if you walk into a venue。😊。

You're going to be shut down a lot of the time until you really get this down initially。

 you ever walk out to a venue and you just feel nervous to talk to people。

 But then when you talk to different people， your brain switches on。

 So the way that I figured it out was I would just start going through the venue and I would talk to everybody。

 Now， let me tell you something else I figured out that was kind of weird。😡。

Through all the gazillion experiments I did， the weirdest one was this。What happened was there's。

There's a couple times this happened。 It really blew my mind。

 I did an exercise where instead of talking to women， I talked to men。

I went up to men and would just go， yo， dude， that's a cool shirtman。 Ay， what's up， bro， A。

 I like your solid dudeude。 A， what's up， man， Oh， you know， oh， your friends are cool。

 You guys have a good vibe here。 I went up to all the men when I went up to all the men。Now。

 I don't know what this says about me。 just kidding。 But when I went up to all the men。

Just beating you the punch there。 When I went up to all the men。

That's when I saw my confidence scope the highest。😡，Now。

 there's another incident that I'm not proud of。 I'm actually ashamed of it。

 but it taught me something very powerful。 I'm ashamed of this。 I'm not proud of this。

 So one time during the economic recession， I was just running out of money。

 It was my business was getting crushed。 And I had a student refund me。

 And because that student refunded me。 I wasn't gonna to be able to pay rent that month。

 I didn't know where my rent was gonna come from。 It It just killed me。 It was so sad。

 And that student， and I did a great boot camp。 any refund me。 Now' any of you guys can refund。

 I don't care。 I'm in a very different life situation。 But at that time I had a new kid。

 I was half a million and debt。 I couldn't pay my rent in like 2009。 This guy refunded me。

 I got so mad that I go，😡，I said to him， yeah， yeah， you want to see what I could do。

 You want to see what I could do。 And this is really lame。

 But I started walking up to guy after guy after guy and approaching them with their girlfriends and just literally removing girl after girl after girl off the guys and making out with all the girls like over and over and over。

 And telling the guys like， shuthu up。 And I will never do this again。 It's disgusting behavior。

 I'm not proud of it。 But what I saw was and the girls were all excited to do it。

 That was what was so crazy。 Like they want to do it。 But what I saw was。😊。

I went into a state of euphoria， almost probably like I took MMA or something like that。Now。

 you know what that taught me， that taught me how these sickcos， these sickco fucking like， you know。

 ganggs kons type people， what they're feeding off of， right， they're just running around。

 dominating everything。 And they're like，ness， euphoric mania， essentially。

 And if if that becomes an ego construct and that ego construct becomes parasitic in the mind。

 this is very deep topic。 But it can become parasitic in the mind。 that ego construct can take over。

 And that's where mania kicks in in a lot of bad stuff。😡，Really crazy topic。

I'll make like a 10 day seminar on ego media and stuff someday。 But you get the idea。

 So because of that， even though I wasn't proud that I did that。

Here's what those two incidents taught me。 Number one， why is it that I went in this crazy。

 happy mood feeling totally confident once all the men were nice to me in the venue。

 when I did a couple experiments doing that， What do you think。It's evolutionary。 the mind sees。

 wait a minute， the men are cool with you， the men are cool with you。

 So you think your intimidation could be talking to women if you're a guy and you're trying to meet a girl。

 actually your fear is that if the girl likes you， the other men will come and attack you okay。

 how do I know this， simple， because when you're in the kind of mode that I'm talking about if you're at a restaurant？

😡，People start coming up to you and being attracted to you。

 you'll be sitting at the restaurant and people will come to you。

 attracted to you when you do nothing。😡，It'll happen。

 you'll literally have people jumping up and talking to you all through your life。

 It's like a magnet。 It's like a mos to a flame。Because they're looking at who's the high status individual and they want to go there when you're this kind of person。

People either want to have sex with you or they want to be LED by you and they want to be you。

 That's the general way that it works。 So from years of looking at dating advice。

 that was what I figured out。 But here's where it went deeper。

 And this was the main lesson that I got。 And this is what I got to get you through here this weekend。

 okay。😡，Here's the lesson that I got。The bigger issue in this for me was not dating。

 That's the least of it。 The dating thing to me。 It's interesting， it's novel， it's kind of fun。

 but it's really the least of what's going on。 I believe that this is the biggest problem that we are having in society This may be the single biggest problem were having in society and it's affecting you Here's what it is every single one of you in here is capable of being a millionaire is capable of having a fulfilling work is capable of more work than you know。

 more focus than you know and more genius that you know。

 But what has happened is that due to our social conditioning。

 your brain is being shut down and held in that low state in perpetuity and then what happens is somebody like you stays there for decades to the point that you don't even know up from down anymore。

 you think this is you， you're in a trance。 This isn't you because I was in a worst trance than you Imagine that you saw him looking like me10 years from now。

 would that freak you out。 Would you say that whatever was in him was。😡，Very， very confining。

So we got to get the devil out of you， bro。I'm joking by the devil， but am I， okay， like it。

 it's like the devil。 essentially。 So here's what it is。

Part of your problem is that you're still pinging for social feedback It's called pinging we're doing it unconscious。

 remember when you talked about who's reacting to who。

 you remember that it's because you're waiting for me to ping you。

 you're waiting for when you talk that I'm gonna give you these little pings of responses which then what will happen is that cues your brain to think that you're at least on equal playing field or higher and then you can talk normal。

 but as long as I don't react to you it starts shutting your brain down and you can't think straight do you feel that？

😡，What if I told you that while that's good for dating， great for dating， you know。

 you get this handled， dating life is going to be greatoo， right， pound lots of holes， cool stuff。

Really cool to pound holes， right？Okay， pound the whole， bro。Giver。

 but that's the least of what this is。 That is like 1% of the benefit of 01% of the benefit of this01%。

 remember I said that by the time you get to another level。

 you'll look back at the older stuff that you cared about， you don't even care anymore。

 that's an example of this。 So basically what I want to do is I want to show you how to switch on your brain。

 Now， what I was saying here is that as you move up， your voice will carry more naturally。

 The reason that your voice will carry is because when you're a leader。😡。

People are going to be looking to you。 And so your voice is like， okay。

 Ive I've got to have it carry so that the people in the tribe can hear me。

 They can hear that I'm the one who's thinking the best。😡，Now， again。

 let's review why do we have this aspect？😡，Because I might be a leader at teaching。

 say let's say social skills， but I'm not a leader at survivalism in the forest。

 So when Bear Grs comes along or the crocodile hunter recipe piece comes along and I got to go fight a crocodile。

 you don't want me to be the leader。😡，I shouldn't be thinking for myself。

 I should listen to what the crocodile hunter tells me to do when the crocodile hunter says。

 jump on that cr， I'm got to go， Yes sir， Yes， sir， and jump on it or I could die。

 So what happens is when you have more confidence in a particular area， this will switch on。

 but what's happening in society。 Well， let's look at the media that you're being exposed to。

 let's think about this for a minute。 when you're looking at， say。😡，Body ideals。

 a lot of the body ideals that we're exposed to， for example， let's look at for guys or girls。

 For men， Do you actually understand how hard it is to get the kind of body that you see in most men's magazines。

Do you want to know why it's hard， you can easily， not easily， but with time。

 get the amount of muscle that a lot of them have， but to get that muscle。

 you've got to intake calories， you get kind of fat or you can get as lean as those guys。

 you can get the six pack， but you're going to lose muscle。

 Do you want to know how the majority of these guys have that kind of body？😡。

A combination of not probably not a ton of steroids， but most of them have done a little deball。

 know， most of them taking a little bit of whnie to cut down。 Do you really want to do that。

 If it's your passion， If it's what you want to do， then that's cool。

 But do you want to do it to live up to someone else's standard。And you or they're taking you know。

 ephedrrine pills to cut， it's affecting your heart。It's not really a healthy body image。

 A lot of women feel pressure that they have to be super duper skinny。😡。

Skinny to the point that's not even healthy。 When you meet a lot of， say， Victoria Se models。

 you look at them， and they look like they're coming from a poor country。😡，It's crazy。

It doesn't even feel good。It doesn't even feel good。So。So。

The main point that I'm saying is that we're exposed to this， right now。

If you see me living in a fat crib and then you don't live in a fat crib， that's going to affect you。

If you see me a better having more Instagram followers than you， that's gonna affect you。

 So these external benchmarks that you may not even want or need are beginning to affect your psyche。

 So you， what's happening is you don't feel like you live up to those benchmarks。 You're short。

 you're skinny， You don't work in a good job。 So now it's happening is you're not living up to those benchmarks and your brain shutting you down。

 And yet， bro， if your brain would just wake up， that stuff wouldn't overly matter。

 it might matter a little bit， but not really。😡，So instead what's happening now is your entire consciousness is just ramed down。

 it's just freaked ram down bro。And you're in this in perpetuity。

 What's the problem with this in society。 The problem is。

 look at all the productivity that we're losing。 We need more entrepreneurs。 We need more leaders。

 We need more genius。 We need more solutions。 We need people to get out of group think。 Most of all。

 we don't want to have wars and genocides。 Dipers that are in that like， this is a joke that I make。

 guyss like you are the first person to commit a genocide。😡。

Because when some crazed psychopath leaders like。Go pull the trigger。 Your brainid is shut down。

 just like when crocodile Huer is like， jump on the gator。 and I'm like， okay。He's like。

 go commit genocide， go do it。 How do I know this， Simple。

 You think that everybody in Germany and World War I was an evil murderer。 Well。

 then how did this happen， How do you explain the mass murders that we see in society。😡。

They're all just a bunch of craze murderers that just had an excuse to finally do it。

 Is that really what you think。😡，Is that really what you think。 I don't think that at all。

 I think most people are in a durping tribal mindset。

 They get told by somebody charismatic to go kill somebody and they listen。

 So I don't trust people like you。😡，I don't trust you。

You're the kind of person that will stab me in the back。

I don't trust you because you're not thinking for yourself。

I don't trust anybody who can't think for themselves because they're bendable， they're manipulable。

 They can easily be flipped against you in a creepy way。 You know who I trust。😡。

II would trust a criminal more than you。Because at least they're thinking in some capacity。😡。

You're not thinking you come up here I try to get you to do something you don't even think。I'm like。

 come up with this， you're just waiting to be told what to do like a sheep。

I want to make it more uncomfortable for you to be in that place than in a better place。

 I want to apply pressure to you So you don't think that's safe。 Right now， you think that's safe。

 Do you understand。😡，I want to make it unsafeer you cycle， I'm not going to hurt you。

 but I want you to feel ashamed of that she thing， ashamed of it。😡。

Feel a deep shame when you go into that Der mindset。 So now let's go back to the voice thing， okay。

With the voicing， the voice will naturally project out when that leadership part of your brain is switched on。

 Okay， there's a book called the winner Effect。 Read that book， It's called the Winter Effect。

 The Wi effectffect book， what it basically says is that。😡，If you're losing in life。

 your brain's neurochemistry changes。 You're gonna to feel this shift in your neurochemistry。

 So what will basically happen is say you want to train a fighter right if you give the fighter an easy fight。

 then you give the fighter a medium fight， a little bit harder fight。

 a little bit harder fight and they're winning and winning and winning and then you pit him against somebody who's been fighting only advanced fighters。

 the guy that got gradually ramped up is going to win because their brain is in that winter effect。

 So what will happen is here's a difference。 Okay let me show you The guy who's been fighting harder competition。

 his brain is shut down So he's gonna pull his punches Do you ever feel when you're approaching someone in your dating life that you're pulling your punches。

😡，Do you feel it， Here's what you're doing， Watch， You're doing this。

 You see someone you want to talk to， you do this。Yeah。Or if you do go， you go， huh。

And you pull your punches。 But when you anticipate a positive response。

 just like if you're punching through the wall and you anticipate your arm's going to go through。

 when you anticipate they're going to be friendly，99% of the time they're friendly。😡。

🎼So this is the mechanism that I want to get switched on and it's way more important that you get switched on than in dating。

 like， yeah， you'll crush in dating when you have this， you'll crush it approaching and dating。

 but that's the least of it because I also want to talk tomorrow about your marketing。

 your core strengths where you can make money and where you can have ingenuity。

 I want to teach you how to be a living legend in your niche。 I want to zero down on a niche。

 I want to show you how to come up with product ideas， come up with business ideas。

 come up with better job ideas within your company and then show you how to switch on your mind and have confidence in yourself and build it。

 Okay I can't make a permanent change in a minute。 but I can show you the ins and outs of it and you can build it up Now by the way。

 Well last thing。😡，大家可以看到啊，在之前的课程的视频里啊，我们做了呃就是与内容和情感分开的训练。我们做了节奏音调语调的训练，还做了一个投射的训练，以及了解这些是怎么去运行和工作的。

所以我们社交光谱啊，不仅仅是关注约会和吸引力，更重要的是我希望帮助他人去打开心智，释放创造力。在你的生活和事业中啊发挥出最大的一个潜能。在现代生活啊，过度的从众和盲目，会扼杀我们独立思考的创造力。

我们习惯于寻求外界的认可，害怕脱颖而出。结果让自己的潜能啊，被深深的压抑。一个人如果习惯于呃成功和胜利，那他的大脑啊就会发生变化，会给他带来更多的动力和勇气。相反啊，如果一个人习惯于失败和挫折。

那他的心理就会变得脆弱，开始畏首畏尾，对未来可能会退缩。这种心理状态啊，反会反过来影响一个人在社交事业等各个方面的表现。那么如何突破这种限制呢？关键是打开我们的领导力开关。

当一个人意识到自己是一个领域的佼佼者，或者正在为自己的一个理想而奋斗的时候，那他的声音和气场啊就会发生变化。他会自然而然的散发出这种自信和魅力去吸引他人的注意力，这种状态不仅仅有利于约会。更重要的是。

他能让一个人在生活和事业上拥有源源不断的创意和动力。无论是电影明星的身材还是社交媒体的点赞术，这些外在的一个标准啊，常常给人带来巨大的压力和挫败感。但真正的自我价值应该是来自于内在的成长和贡献。

而不是外界的认可。一个人只有不再被这些幻想所迷惑的时候，才能真正释放自己的潜能，所以说一个人的觉醒，一个灵魂的绽放，也许就能点亮无数的生命来照亮整个人的未来。而作为引路人，我们社交光谱的价值正在于此。
