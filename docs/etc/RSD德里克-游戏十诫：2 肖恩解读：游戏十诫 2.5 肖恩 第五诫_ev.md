# RSD德里克-游戏十诫：2 肖恩解读：游戏十诫 2.5 肖恩 第五诫_ev

Commanment 5， thou shalt convey your identity。So we talked a lot in the previous commandments about how to define and develop your identity。

 What we're going to talk about now is how to express your identity。

 There's an old adage that the best way to attract women is to unquote， just be yourself。

 This is one of those saying that is simultaneously，100 per true and 100 per cent useless。

 The problem with this advice is that the average man doesn't know who he is。 He doesn't have a self。

 And so it's pretty fuckingin heartart for him to be himself。 However。

 since we help you define in great detail who you are in commandment。 too。

 at least that part is solved。 If you haven't done that yet， please go back and do it now。

 if you still don't want to do it， please join the priesthood and take a vow of celibacy so that at least the sex you will not be having will be easier to explain to your family。

 The other problem with just be yourself， is that the average man doesn't have any idea how to communicate that side of himself effectively。

 He can be himself in front of his friends， But in front of women he either freezes up or communicate。

Cates his personality in a way that is uncompelling。

So what I'm going to teach you now is called compelling authenticity and is something that I learned from Derek and observed from Derek。

This is the way to really be yourself and to communicate it in the most compelling manner。

 My goal is for you to know in detail what you should be doing in that 90% cent of game between open and close。

 The overarching principle for all of this is what's called honest signals。

 Honest signals are things that you cannot fake。 They are impossible to fake。 For instance。

 relaxed eye contact is impossible to fake unless you give yourself large doses of tranquils。

 It is impossible to fake being very， very fit。 is impossible to fake not having your voice crack when someone is yelling at you。

 So let's understand a little bit about the progression of this meeting success with women community over time。

 So the progression is back in the day， people who do all these little tips and tactics and they would all be scripted。

 They are called routines。And it was basically 100% contrived lines that were supposed to mimic the honest signals of someone who is actually good with girls。

 actually high value and actually compelling。 So you'd go up and you would tell a really compelling story that illustrated how you had all these girls and you were rich。

 but it was supposed to come off as if you weren't actually saying that you were rich and you weren't actually saying that you had all these girls around。

 But then people caught on to this stuff。 And they started recognizing when people were telling these little routines。

 And so people dropped routines。 But they still had other parts of their game that were scripted。

 But then people caught on to those things。 And they had to drop those scripts。

 And there was this progression of having to go from these contrived tactics and these contrived lines to just more and more honest signals。

 And you see this in the real world as well。 Think about the line what's your sign。 Well。

 they supposed to mimic a guy who was really intuitive about women and can tell women something about themselves。

Because some guy figured out that women are attracted to men who have good intuition into their lives。

 Then that line cut on and the line became dead。 I'll give you an example of a line that is recently become dead。

 Me and my friend Michael， we're talking recently about how we've heard a lot of guys using the after party thing。

 You， when you tell a girl， oh， come to my house， there's an afterpart。 there's an afterpart。 Well。

 that's hit the mainstream now。 And that line is dead。 And so in real life。

 you see this progression where a guy will figure out a tactic that kind of mimics an actual cool guy。

 and he will use it。 then will become mainstream or people will catch on。 and then will become dead。

 And the net effect of this is that game in general has gone more and more towards those honest signals。

 things that you cannot fake。 Because all of this stuff that's contrived will eventually come out。

 And most of it already is out。 That's why we talk about building a strong sense of who you are and conveying that authentically。

 because these are things that are real， and they actually make you that guy。 Even will look。

Over a lot of my old notes from back in the day， a lot of the things I was doing years ago were trying to mimic what a cool guy would do rather than just working on being that cool guy。

 And in my own progression I have seen that now all of those things have been replaced by me just being the person that I was trying to be。

 So the main theme for this part of the section is working on honest signals。

 there are things that will never go out of style， because they are something inherent to the human condition。

So I thought really hard about what made me go through this transformation that trying to mimic someone who has that certainty and that social intelligence to what actually got me there。

 and theres two major epiphanies， one was entitlement， which I touched on earlier。

 which is that entitlement is a lack of feeling and a lack of thought and the other part was deservedness。

So deservedness is a little different than entitlement。

 It is the logical knowing why you deserve these quote unquote，9s and tens。

 And this is something that my friend actually ask me about after a weekend where I'd been with like three girls。

 and we were driving home。 He asked me what allows you to know that you deserve these girls。

 And I ended up talking to him about this for something like five hours。

 which I'm going to dis still for you right now， imagine that you're in a situation where from the age of 14 to the age of 20。

 everyone is constantly kissing your ass。 They are constantly telling you that your beliefs。

 no matter what you say they are are true， they are constantly buying you things。

 They are constantly giving you validation for no reason， and everyone is doing this to you。

 Old men are doing this to you from the age of 15， you have no idea why people are flying you places。

 People are putting you up in hotels。 People are telling you that doing coke and drinking is good for you。

 There's no pressure for you to。A sense of self。 There's no pressure to develop a work ethic。

 anything that happens。 you will be taken care of。 and you don't even understand why。

 but this is just happening from all angles。 Well， this is the reality of a lot of these really。

 really hot girls that you'll see in L or New York or Vegas nightlife。

 They have had no pressure on themselves to develop who they are。

 and they are in this very weird position where society is aggrandizing them。

 They are putting them at the very top。 They are putting them on billboards。

 They are writing movies about some guy who just pines over the super hot girl and thinks that that girl is a soulmate。

 He thinks that that girl is the answer to all his problems。

 and he gets the girl and she is the answer to all his problems。

 And what I saw in my time out was this disconnect between the hot girls I was dating the type of confidence they had。

 the type of hobbies they had， the type of habits they had。

 the type of life that they LED and the way that is portrayed by other people。

 the way other people believe these hot girls are。And the way I used to believe these hawk girls are。

So let me give you a story。 I dated a girl that was a beauty pageant winner。

 and she was the type of girl that actually got hired for modeling gigs。

 You may have actually seen her on one of these billboards。 And when I started dating her。

 She was one of the hottest girls Id ever dated long term。 And I saw the type of life that she lived。

 She lived in her mother's basement。 She had dropped out of college。

 She could go anywhere without her childhood blanket。 She had no hobbies， She had no habits。

 she had ridiculous beliefs that had no connection to reality。

 She was essentially a female version of a guy who plays world of warcraft in his mother's basement。

 I ended up breaking up with her when I asked her what's the last book you read。

 and she said she hadn't read a book since the 8 grade。 That was the last straw。

 I knew that however hot she was， She didn't share my same values。

 And I honestly wasn't even attracted to her anymore more。 So now。

 when I see one of those billboards。 Or when I see that girl in the club that is just absolutely gorgeous。

 There's that initial spark around the。Oh my God， that girl's fucking gorgeous。 But honestly。

 that emotional anchor for me now is thinking back to that girl and thinking back to the other girls I've dated that were exactly like that that have so little personality。

 so little certainty and so little going on in their lives that if I were to date them。

 I literally wouldn't be able to stay with them for three months。

 you have to understand that this mythology that society creates it around hot women and that you are creating around hot woman is total bullshit。

 they are not like that in real life and that if you were to date one of these girls for a long period of time you would number one realize that you are offering more value to her than she could ever offer to you that every part of your life is probably more built up than hers is and that all these guys that are chasing her and putting her on a pedal stool and pretending that she's their soulmates are really just suffering from an illusion。

 And I want you guys to realize this without having to go through that experience。

 Now this doesn't mean become arrogant and think that oh， I'm just better than all of these girls。

 but realize that they are human beings and that a lot of these really。

Really haunt girls have not had the type of pressure that you have to develop yourself and that all of this importance that we place on these women is essentially an optical illusion。

 The next part for me was understanding the overarching principles of compelling authenticity。

 And a lot of this came from observing Derek。These are the actionable ways of speaking that express who you are in a compelling way。

 I've included exercises with each of them。 They are honesty， relaxing into a range of behaviors。

 frame control， potency， riding the wave of validation and connection。Honesty。

 I touched on this in commandment 3， and I want to give you a little bit more detail on what this actually means。

So at any given time， there is always a range of thoughts and feelings popping up in your mind。

 And we want you to get to that place where whatever you think， right， you are expressing out。

 But there is no way for you to ever be able to express all of that。 If I were express， Oh。

 it's warm in this room。 My ass itches。 If I express everything。

 thered never be a way for me to express。The myriad of thoughts and the myriad of sensations and feelings that I am feeling。

 It is impossible。 However， there is usually one thought or feeling that' is most essential to your current overall experience and most relevant to this situation。

 This is why the line high。 your cu。 I wanted to meet you became so popular a couple of years ago。

 because the guys that were originally using it were in touch with that most relevant thought and that most relevant feeling and were able to express that without flinching。

That eventually became used by a bunch of other guys， but it wasn't their most relevant thought。

 It wasn't their most essential feeling。 And so it came off as incongruent and just became another non honestn signal。

 So when that thought becomes clear during an interaction。 You verbalize it。

 Then one thought leads to another range of thoughts and a range of feelings。

 But there is usually one that is most prominent and essential。

 You then go to that thought or feeling。 That leads to another range of thoughts and another range of thoughts with ones that are most essential in each case。

 was this called， well， this is essentially nerds speakak for something called stream of consciousness。

 and it's exactly what we're going for。 most of my game at this point is based on rants。

 something in the room will remind me of something I'm interested in。

 and I will start talking about that， it will lead to another range of thoughts。

 and I will start talking about the thing that interests me most。

 and I will start talking about something else。 and I will end up just talking for a long period of time。

 And because that is my true personality， what you're hearing now， me talking on cognitive topics。

Really is my personality。 And so I will do that in front of the girl。

 and it becomes very powerful because she knows that is honest and is most congruent with who I really am is the most essential part of me。

So we are not advocating honesty of some intense moral code。

 but we're advocating it because of its power because when you're honest。

 your subcommunications will naturally fall into line。

 So little exercise on how to start doing this honest talk and this stream of consciousness thinking。

Number one， stare at a wall。 Number two， wait for a range of thoughts or feelings to pop up and verbalize the most prominent one。

 Wait for that thought to lead to a second range of thoughts and emotions and then verbalize that one。

 If you do this for 10 minutes a day and then go to the club and just start doing the same thing。

 you'll basically be said。 If you remember my example of the guy on the plane。 The bro。

 that is exactly what he was doing。 like， hey， I want a beer。 you're cute。 plain is called， right。

 He's just verbalizing things。 Who the fuck does that。 No one does it。

 And that's why it's so compelling because it is speaking something true to who you are。

 Next part of compelling authenticity。 C a range of behaviors through relaxation。

 When I look back at my successful interactions。 What I see is a natural oscillation between many different behavioral patterns。

 Part of the interaction， I'm loud parts of it， I'm quiet。 Part of it。 I'm funny Part of it。

 I'm serious。 Part of it， I'm having。Part of it， I'm being more subdued。

 Any who has meditated knows just how many types of thoughts and emotions you go through in an hour period。

 In fact， when I first started doing hourlong meditations。

 I thought he must have bipolar disorder because for the first time I was aware of just how many thoughts and emotions everyone goes through in a short period of time。

 These successful interactions with these huge ranges of behavior where a reflection of my natural internal state。

 Someone who is anxious may go through a lot of different thoughts and emotions。

 but they can only express an extremely narrow range。 Think James Bonds， He might be playing cards。

 He might be fighting someone。 He might be flirting， he might be happy。 he might be sad。

 he might be telling a joke， he might be deadly serious。

 part of the reason James Bond is such a compelling character is because he has that range of behaviors。

 Now， think about someone like Michael Sarah。 Michael Sarah is pretty much the same person in every movie。

 Why， because he's anxious and because he can't help but act that。When someone is anxious。

 they that is the only way that they can act。 Being anxious stifles your ranges of behaviors and being relaxed。

 Exp your ranges of behaviors。 So why is this important， Well， for women。

 it's kind of a two for one deal。 a range of behaviors projects relaxation and what is relaxation suggests Well。

 it suggests that the guy lives a life of abundance that he's not worried about anything that life is going fine that he would give a good life for her and her children that he has all the resources he needs at the same time。

 relaxation allows a range of behaviors。 and what does that project Well。

 it projects resourcefulness back to James Bond a very。

 very resourceful person by showing a range of behaviors。

 It shows that you have many different tools in a toolbox for which to navigate your shared life with that girl together So both relaxation and a range of behaviors go hand in hand and they are both extremely。

tive to women by doing this one step， you are automatically projecting most of the good qualities that women look for Confidence will not exactly the same as relaxation is certainly parallel。

 They look extremely similar， which is why you will get these guys who all they do is smoke weed and hang out on the beach。

 and then you find out that they fucked like half of the girls in their small town。

 A lot of these bros， a lot of these jocks。 The reason that they're just getting girl after girl after girl is that they are extremely relaxed。

 they have those ranges of behaviors and that look so similar to the confidence of a true boss of a truly successful person that girls can't tell the difference。

 And they end up just getting these hot girls。 So how do we develop this。 Well， in the long term。

 it means exercise eating a lot of green， leafy vegetables。 meditation。 Having your life handled。

 actually solving the things in your life so that you feel relaxed and you feel carefree。

 Learn to have fun， which we will get to in a。Cha。 Now， you might be thinking， well， you know。

 I heard about all that stuff。 I heard about the exercising and the eating green and the meditation。

 Y， but how many of you are fucking doing it。 No， dude。

 what we're talking about is honest signals here， things that you can't fake。

 things that will always be better than the things that you do fake。

 And that means actually going out and taking these actions。

 I suggest to you that you view the things that Derek and I are telling you。

 not as some academic exploration， but as real commandments for your life。 That is why we called it。

 the 10 commandments。 So go out and actually build these things in the long term。

 What about the short term， Well， relaxation in the short term comes from a nonresistance to thoughts and emotions。

 Everyone feel some sort of pain in their body at some point。 Everyone has disturbing thoughts。

 Everyone has disturbing emotions。But what people who are naturally relaxed do is they just don't take those thoughts and emotions seriously。

 and they don't offer resistance to those thoughts and emotions。

 So let's say you have the thought that your boss might yell at you tomorrow。 If you just think。

 okay， that thought is there。 that's where the thread ends。 however， if you start thinking。

 I shouldn't be having that thought。 And that leads to an anxious feeling。

 And then you feel like you shouldn't be having that feeling so you start getting more anxious and then you start getting more anxious thoughts。

 you're basically any losing battle。 There is a 5000 year old religion that is entirely concerned with nonresistance called Buddhism。

 So that's the short termm nonresistance to thoughts and emotions。

 let's say you're having a real panic attack in the club or you's just feeling so anxious that you can't approach。

 Well， there's a little exercise I use for boot camp students who get into this mode。 numberumb one。

 sit or stand。 unlock your ankles， knees， hips， shoulders， elbows， neck and jaw。 Now。

 concentrate directly on。Your feet untense the muscles。

 Take a deep breath and just concentrate on the sensations of your feet without resistance。 Next。

 concentrate on your ankles。 Next， concentrate on your calf muscles。

 Untense the muscles take a full breath while concentrating on the sensations without resistance。

 You do this for every part of your body all the way up to the top of your head。

 It is something that I want you to be able to use when you are having those very anxious thoughts in the middle of the club。

 In the short term， mimic those losers who are getting laid by just not resisting your thoughts and emotions。

 In the long term， do those things， exercise， eating green meditation。

 having your life handled that will give you that sense of relaxation。Next。

 part of compelling authenticity， frame control， extremely。

 extremely important concepts and something Drerick， I think。

 does probably better than anyone in the world。 So what is it。

Everyone has their own world view and their own version of reality。

 When two people talk to each other， they create a shared reality that is somewhere between these two realities。

If someone has a strong frame and the other person has a weak frame。

 the created reality will look much more like the first guy's reality。 Here's a good example。

 I talked about that honesty exercise that we do on boot camp where I will say my three most honest things。

 Derek will say his three most honest things。 And then we will get the student to say their three most honest things。

 Well， a lot of times Derek will say something like I really hate PC culture。

 And then you'll see these guys who are very obviously into PC culture。

 Maybe they come from Washington， D。 C or they come from San Francisco。 And then they will say， oh。

 yeah， I really hate PC culture， too。 And I will stop them。 and I'll say。

 you you actually don't hate PC culture。 what you're doing is buying into our frame。

 You are buying into our sense of reality。 And this happens in every conversation between two people。

 One person is going have a stronger frame。 They're going to see more certain of what they are saying。

 Another person is gonna have a weaker frame。 They are going to give up their own sense of reality。😊。

They're going to seem less certain of what they are saying。 And eventually。

 they're just going to start kind of mimicking your views and your thought structures。

 I highly suggest you look for this。 This this happens literally every single conversation two people have。

 So why is frame control so important。 The reality for a girl is that each new approaching guy's average。

 not worth their time and needs to prove himself。 If you buy into that frame。

 you are either going to be rejected out of habit。 or you are going to end up trying to qualify yourself。

 because that's the reality of who she thinks the average guy is。 Secondly。

 a strong frame suggests resourcefulness and an ability to influence other men。

How could that be important to women。 I wonder，3， if you plan on leading her anywhere she needs to buy into your reality by her buying into your frame more than you are buying into her frame。

 She naturally starts looking to you for leadership。

 And that makes it much easier to lead the interaction where you want to go。 And lastly， Most people。

 men and women on some level know how uncertain they are of everything。

 We talked about that in commandment one。 They're uncertain and they kind of know on some deep level that they are uncertain。

 and they won't respect someone who defers to their uncertainty。 Think about owning a house。

 and you know that the house has a shitty foundation that's falling apart。

 And someone one comes up and starts begging you to buy the house。

 they're begging you to buy the house。 Would you trust their judgment or would you think that they're a crazy person。

 Most people secretly， although they might act certain on the outside。

 they know how undefined their values are， they know how uncertain they are of how the world works。

 And so when you start playing into their frame， they。

kindin of lose respect for you because it is like you buying a house without that awareness that the house is falling down inside。

 How do we lose frame control。 One is by changing our thoughts to conform to other people's thoughts。

 And the other is getting knocked off our emotional path。

 So changing your thoughts for other people or changing your emotions for other people。

 I'll give you an example， maybe you like sports and maybe you don't。

 But let's say that you like sports and someone who's maybe a boss or they're just more confident than you are。

 starts talking about like， yeah， I don't fucking waste my time watching men wrestle with other men stupidid。

 And then you start naturally nonaccenting your love of sports and even changing your thoughts in speech to emphasize your agreement with them。

 even though you do not agree。 example of getting knocked of your emotional path。

 Let's say that you're just going about your day。 And for some reason。

 someone looks you in the eye and just shakes their head。😡，And you feel bad inside。

 You feel that loss of validation， Or maybe it's even more serious。

 Maybe your girlfriend says something like， oh， you know， I've always thought you're。

 you're a bit of a pussy。Most people would get knocked off their emotional path。

 They are losing their frame， either by conforming their thoughts to others or by not feeling the emotion that they are originally feeling。

 They're buying into that other person's reality。 The reality that you should feel different that you should feel bad or that you should think the way that they think Both of these happen through the same mechanism。

 Someone says or does something that causes an emotional spike。

 Most often this emotional spike is social pressure。 So you might say your opinion。

 And then someone might give you a look and say you don't actually believe that。

 you feel this little spike of emotions， little spike of anxiety。 Sometimes it's even imperceptible。

 You're like，ugh and just knock you off your frame and your thoughts start conforming to their worldview。

 or maybe that guy he's ranting about sports or he's ranting about not liking sports。

 And you feel that little spike of social pressure。

 And then your thoughts start changing to mimic his thoughts。

 or you start expressing your thoughts to sound more like his thoughts。

 These emotional spikes can happen in different ways。 Someone could say something that makes you。

Angry， someone could look really attractive。 How can this throw you off your frame。 Well。

 think of the guy that goes up to the girl。 He's usually really good at talking to people。

 And then all of a sudden， he's stuttering like an idiot because he had that little emotional spike of extreme attraction and threw him off his current thoughts and his current emotions。

The insidious part of keeping your frame is that often this event and this spike are completely unexpected。

 This is why people who have been in like the least situations often talk about how well they do in those situations。

 So like the kid who spent most of his life in his mom's basement。

 he thinks he could kick everyone's ass， he thinks he could get any girl。

 he thinks that if he ever had to go to war， he would just do awesome。

 he doesn't understand how often real life creates these unexpected situations that throw you off your current path。

 So how do you combat losing your frame。 Number one， start recognizing when this is happening。

 Number 2， when this happens， when you get that little spike of emotion。 instead of reacting。Pause。

 communicate your original thought and emotion。 Eventually， when you do this enough。

 you won't have to pause any more。 It will just be a natural， congruent part of who you are。

 Why does this work， Because this getting thrown off our frame by these little emotional spikes It happened so quickly。

 And when you are immediately trying to react to what theyre doing。

 you forget what you were thinking and what you were feeling。 When you pause。

 you are able to come back from that emotional spike to what you are thinking and what you are feeling and continue it。

 Another way to combat this， This is more of an an overarching thing。

 is to think of things in a wide view， This means remembering who you are。

 So let's say that you go into a church and you're not a religious person。

 And people just start talking to you about how you need to believe in Jesus and God is out there and you're going to go to hell and all this stuff。

 Well， if you get tunnel vision， you might start succumbing to that social pressure and those emotional spikes。

 However， if you take a wide view， you remember who you are。

 you remember that there is a world outside of this church。😡。

Becomes much easier to just continue on with your frame。

 your current thought and your current emotion。 Think about someone like Bora。

 One of the best scenes from that movie is he's seeing the Kazakhstan National anthem in front of several thousand people and they're all booing him。

 And he just keeps seeing louder and louder。 Well， you have to remember that Sasha Baron Cohen remembers that he's Sasha Barron Cohen。

 He remembers that he's filming a movie and that it's a comedy。

 He remembers that the context in which he's doing this is part of a wider context。

 He's taking that wide view。 And so he's able to keep his frame despite all that social pressure。

 Next， how we exert frame。😊，So I talked a little bit about how a lot of guys will get into this field。

 They will originally be timid， and then they will start to become super， super polarizing。 In fact。

 I know a guy that does this all the time。 He thinks that exerting his frame is just saying the most offensive thing possible。

 pissing people off， getting people's feathers ruffled。

 But the reason that he doesn't get stellar results is that he's still reacting to them。

 He's trying to show them that he doesn't give a shit。 He's still coming from a place of uncertainty。

So when we think about frame， we are not thinking about yelling people down orre not thinking about correcting people at every turn。

 What we are thinking about is more a just steady stream of who you are a continuation of that thought and emotion。

 I think of frame like this。 A lot of people that get into this that do that polarizing stuff。

 They think frame is an explosion， right， Someone says something and they say， no， I think this。

 where they say this offensive thing。 In reality， frame is not an explosion。

 frame is a steady stream of water。 So think about the Grand Canyon。 How is the Grand Canyon formed。

 essentially by a steady stream of water going through a rock formation over a very long period of time。

 Eventually the stream of water wore it down。 Think about Chinese water torture。

 This is where you will drop water on someone's forehead till it bores a hole into their skull。

 water over time has shaped the entire landscape of our known world。Similarly。

 exerting frame is simply a process of continuing。Like I said， continuing that thought of emotion。

 And that's how I want you to think of it。 It's that steady stream of water and it just a process of continuing what you are already doing。

 This is why the best response to shit tests is no response。

 For those of you that don't know what a shit test is。

 That's when a girl will say something to kind of knock you off your game and she's looking for your reaction。

 She's looking to see that you're not reacting to it。 in particular。

 frame is a continuation of being your default self。 What do I mean by your default self。 Well。

 when you're round your best friends， you're able to naturally express your thoughts and emotions。

 Then in other times， you are contorting yourself to fit to their thoughts and emotions。

 But your default self is for you to just be expressing your thoughts and emotions。

 That's how you act around the people that you are most comfortable with。

So when you wake up in the morning， you are your default self。

 and all frame is is learning to continue that default self in the long term and continue that current emotion and current thought in the short term。

 Remember when something knocks you off。 pause， remember what you were feeling what you are thinking before and just continue on that。

Exercise， notice when someone knocks you off your frame。 Pa。

 Con your current thoughts or continue your current emotional state。 Eventually。

 you will be able to do this without pausing。Next part of compelling authenticity。

 potency versus positivity。 So a lot of guys hear that it's extremely important to be positive in your interactions。

 They will hear that the guys that are the best with women， they're very， very positive。

 They're always positive。 So what happens， these guys will hear about positivity。

 and they will start just being overly sunny about things。 They'll just label everything is positive。

 Oh， no， it's all great。 the fact that my girlfriend， she is on me with my best friend。 No。

 it's fine， man， it's all love。 What they don't realize is that when people are talking about positivity within the context of meeting women and being compelling to people。

 What they're actually talking about is potency。 So positivity is labeling everything is positive。

 Poency is expressing quality emotions。 What are these emotions。 Energy， engagementng， strength。

 conviction。 You have anomph to what you're saying。 So if you look at D and I。

 We're not always positive to say the least。 In fact。😊，Half of my game， I would say， is dark humor。

 I love dark humor。 I think it's hilarious。 However， you can see that there is a lot of this energy。

 a lot of this engagement to what we are saying。😊，The reason route positivity doesn't work is that you are pretending like everything in the world is fine when it's not。

 And that comes off like you are denying reality because you can't handle it。 Poency， however。

 is that energy behind what you're saying。 So in the short term。

 that means adding your inner fire to what you are doing or saying。 I mean， for me。

 it's making really， really dark jokes。 What's a good example of this。 Well。

 if you've ever read Tucker Max。 You see that a lot of what he's saying is very non PC。

 He's telling just awful fucking jokes。 But supposedly， this guy got a lot of girls。

 because they can just see that fire in his eyes。 He's able to bring a lot of energy to those parts of his personality。

 In the long term， that means engagement。 Joy and purposefulness in what you are doing。

So I've been around Drek a lot。 And when I see that he gets tired。

 he's still engaged in whatever task he's doing。 He might be talking about some cynical stuff。

 He might be tired。 He might be exhausted。 He might be grumpy。

 But because he's still engaged in what he's doing， he's still expressing potency。

 Why is this important， Because people are fucking bored。

 And there's that old concept that what you feel they feel。 So when you can add that energy。

 you can add that potency into what you're saying， they will feel it。 too。 Secondly。

 it conveys an excitement and joy with your own niche world。

 And we're going to talk about expanding your niche world in the seventh commandment。

 It's that own excitement with your own world rather than wishing you are in someone else's world。

 or pretending that the world at large， is something it's not。So take a show like sons of anarchy。

 It's a very engaging show。 And in the show， he's a character， but he gets a lot of girls。

 There's just a bunch of guys and leather jackets on motorcycles like shooting Latino people。

 why the fuckox should you even care。 Why should anyone care while you're seeing how much the characters care about this niche lifestyle。

 How important it is to them。 How engaged they are in what they are doing。

 that this club that they have， this small world of their motorcycle game means everything to them。

 And when you can express that excitement with your own little niche world。

 It creates the frame that your world is more compelling than someone else's world。😊，Lastly。

 it conveys congruence and authenticity through a framework of strong character traits。

 In other words， you are still you， no matter what the situation， This last part is really。

 really key。 And I'm going to expand on it a little bit。

 So I talked a little bit about how congruence is one of the biggest differences between an intermediate guy and an advanced guy。

 So the example is we used to know this guy。 He would go to the club。 He'd be super depressed。

 You know， he talked girls and he would just say， I'm so depressed right now。 This place sucks。

 You know， we should just get out of here。 And the girls would be bought into that。

 right So he would leave the club with them。Well， I think the biggest difference between an advanced and elite guide and what me and Derek do is what is called potent congruence。

 So what this is， is being able to show that potency from whatever state you're in。

 That's what I mean when I'm saying conveying congruentence and authenticity through a framework of strong character traits means that those character traits do not waver whether you're tired。

 whether you're pissed off， whether you're angry， whether you're in a good mood or a bad mood。

 a guy that's in natural， he may be congruent， but a lot of times when he's congruent。

 he's not able to show that potency。 So those strong character traits are no longer shining through Someone who is truly elite can show these character traits in both good times and bad times。

 This is why vulnerability can be so powerful， you're okay with who you are， even the dark side。

 and you still have those character traits when you're in that dark side。

 So I talked a little bit about from me， a lot of my game is rants。 Well， when I go on dates。

 a lot of times， I'm getting off may be。20 hours of work。

 I'm getting off of a month of 20 hour work days。 So I know that I'm not going to be in a good mood on the date。

 And I know I'm going to be tired， and I know I'm going to be pissed off。

 but I also know that this might be the only chance for me to go on a date that month。

 because I go through very intense work periods。 So what do I do， Numb one。

 I congruent and I add potency to that congruence。 I will start ranting at girls about。

 you know something I'm thinking about some topic that I'm upset about。

 and I will just keep going with it。 And I will add energy to it so they can see my mind engaging。

 They can see that those character traits of strength， of energy of engagement。

 come through even when I'm going through tough times。 It's very powerful。

 So how do we create potency。 First， speak congruently from whatever state you're in except your emotions internally and externally。

Second， engage fully in whatever you're doing。That's it。 This is simple。

 but in how many day to day situations are you actually doing this。 Remember。

 what's simple to do is simple not to do Exerse for a full day， practice these two steps。

 Spak congruently from whatever state you're in and engage fully in whatever you're doing。

 I'm going to say it again to emphasize the importance。

 Spe congruently from whatever state you're in， engage fully in whatever you're doing。

Last part of compelling authenticity and the last part of showing your identity in these interactions with women。

 This is called riding the wave of Validation， and it's going to cover a topic called takeaways that has been a part of success with women for a long time。

 and I'm going to talk about how me and do this differently than other people。

So the basic concept is anything that lets the girl know that she doesn't have our full validation yet and that we don't give a shit if she stays or leaves。

 A few examples， Julian might open the girl by saying， oh， that dress is a little too blue。

 It's a little too blue。 Gey， he might add into his interaction。 Oh， should I leave。

 I can leave if you want me to。 Tyler， he might tell the girl I'm still evaluating you。

 The concept is the same。 All of them are conveying。 she doesn't have her full validation yet。

 and that we really don't care what she does。So why the fuck are we doing this。

 Are we just fucking with people and trying to make them feel bad？ No。

 what this allows is an emotionally compelling experience for the girl instead of a flat。

 unemotional experience that mimics every other part of her life。 More importantly。

 allows you to communicate to the girl that you have standards。

 The truth is no one wants their ask his， and no one wants something that has no scarcity and that they don't have to work for。

 So we tend to chase things that are hard to catch since what's hard to catch in the real world is usually of great value。

 This creates a natural tendency to attach positive attributes to those that don't give us immediate validation。

 and negative attributes to those that do。 This is called the halo effect。

 We all chase validation to some degree。 First thing to understand。

 Not only is this true of the girl。 It is true of you， too。 Yes， you。

 the person listening to this recording。 Whoever you are。 This is true of you as well。

 and you are not above the psychological tendency。 Every one chases validation。😡，However。

 there is a range， some people respond more to having validation taken away and some people respond less。

 Over time， you get a sense of where the people you meet fall on that spectrum。

 Most beautiful women fall on the validation chasing end of that spectrum due to the constant validation they receive from everyone around them。

 And the almost nonexistent pressure on them to find validation internally。

 So at some point in the interaction you're going to have to use takeaways to make the experience emotionally compelling and to communicate that you aren't just the average idiot that has no standards or boundaries。

 The key part of takeaways or push pole， as it used to be called。

 is to find out where the person is most comfortable on that validation spectrum and then oscillates between giving and taking away validation and an intensity that allows an emotionally compelling experience that is neither boring nor too much。

 as in the girl just walks away because you're being a dick。

 The takeaways they've seen most guys use fall into one of three categories。 Act takeaways。

 This is saying， you know， little too blue。I don't like that dress。 Oh。

 you usually wear makeup that way， you know， E cetera， right， reaction takeaways， you know。

 a girl says something and you say， oh， you don't have to try that art。Or a girl says something。

 and you ro your eyes。Third category， disagreement and exerting your own frame and opinion。

 So girl gets her opinion and you disagree and say your own opinion。 Now。

 I want you to know those categories and understand the structure of those so that you get how they work and you are aware of the dynamic。

 However， De and I do this a little differently。What we do is called real takeaways。

 So we are actually doing things that are technically within those three categories。

 but they are honest and they are not contrived。 What's a good example。 Well， back in the day。

 I was talking to a girl。 and De was helping me wing her friend。 And he is talking to his girl。

 And I was talking to mine。 And me and my girl were getting along really well。

 And we decided that we were gonna take them over to another part of the bar。

 And so we start taking them over and his girls just being kind of wishy washy。 And so he just goes。

 okay， I really don't like girls that are indecisive。 So I got to go。

 And so me and him start walking away。 And my girl comes up to me。 and she's like。

I don't understand me and you were getting along so well and I go， yep。

 but if it's a choice between siding with my friend or siding with a girl I just met。

 I got a with my friend and I just walked off。So later in the night， she actually went and found me。

 She wouldn't found me， and we ended up going home together。

 and she seemed completely in love with me after I gave that real takeaway。

 So that is something that is actually enforcing our boundaries。

 So with an active takeaway what be an example of a real active takeaway。 It's like， oh。

 I don't like that tattoo。 I usually like this other type of tattoo or I don't like tattoos at all。

 real opinion。 reaction takeaway。 Girl says something stupid and you roll your eyes。

 Disment and exerting your own frame and opinion takeaway。 Well。

 there is actually telling girls your own opinion。 We've covered that extensively。

 This is the place I want you to get to。 is important to experiment with some of these stock takeaways so that you understand their effect。

 But once you become moderately proficient with them， drop the stock takeaways。

 then start accenting the natural parts of yourself that cause this effect anyways。

 they're still going to be in those three categories， but they're going to be real now。

 the end goal is for this validation chasing dynamic to come naturally because。

Personality is so thoroughly expressed。So why is this better than some of the stock takeaways or these contrived takeaways。

 Well we talked about honest signals， Anything that you can do something that conveys realness that conveys that you are actually that cool guy。

 that guy that actually has standards。 It will be 1 thousand times more effective than the contrived way。

 simultaneouslyous， this is not only having the effect of a takeaway。

 but is also communicating our values in our boundaries at the same time。

 It's communicating things that are real to us those character traits that we want to be shining through。

 So the last part of compelling authenticity is connection。

 actually having a connection with someone。 But I'm going to talk about that in the six commandments。

 And I'm going to tell you why when you listen to that6 commandment。 Book recommendation。

 I hope they serve beer and hell by Tucker Max。It。
