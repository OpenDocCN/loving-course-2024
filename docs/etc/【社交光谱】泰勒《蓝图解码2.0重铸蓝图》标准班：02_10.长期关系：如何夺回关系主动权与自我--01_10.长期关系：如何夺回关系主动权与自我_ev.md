# 【社交光谱】泰勒《蓝图解码2.0重铸蓝图》标准班：02_10.长期关系：如何夺回关系主动权与自我--01_10.长期关系：如何夺回关系主动权与自我_ev

我是社交光谱莱特。那么我们继续蓝童解码2。0之旅。我相信啊这期的内容一定会给许多人在亲密关系中的困惑带来启发和帮助。从爱别人到爱自己，一个人成长的必经之路。泰勒不仅仅提供了深刻的洞察。

更给出了实际可行的方法和建议。那么正常的关系是什么样子的。我们怎么才能够不去消耗自己的关系。很多人可能会因为从对方那里获得了大量的关注啊，信引吸引等回馈，而觉得这段关系非常的美好。

但如果这段关系的相处模式是以牺牲自己的时间、经历，损害自己的事业、身心健康作为代价的。那从长远来看，这种关系其实是不健康的，不可持续的。如果一个人在情感中总是感到疲惫或者是被掏空了。

他就很难有能量去经营其他重要的人生事业，比如健康工作等等。一段关系如果长期进入这种高投入、低回报的失衡的状态，对一个人整体的人生而言，其实是一种拖累和损耗。而那些不计代价的付出，最后往往也难以给对方真。

🎼正的快乐，因为一个折损。🎼きき？We're going to go back in the communication side okay。

 but that's going to be your homework between now and we're going to do very。

 very heavy auditing together and look at everything in your life I'll tell you right now how I fully came up with this。

 it was from playing video game。😡，Okay there's a game called Horizon  Ze Dawn on PlayStation 4。

 Who years Play Horizon put your hand up。 Okay so you know when you're crafting the ammunition。

 So in most games， it's just that you just press the button a lot。

 you kill the enemy and if you kill the enemy， you go to the next level right， Well。

 how is Horizon different？😡，How do you get the ammo on H？You have a bone arrow right。

 how do you make all the different fire arrows in this arrow and that arrow， how do you make it？😡。

You have to gather the parts， you have to craft it right So in Horizon 0 Da。

 you could beat the enemy so you feel like you're moving to another level。

 but you actually went backwards because if you take too many hits，😡，Well。

 now you've got to go get a bunch of medicine because you took too many hits。

And so now you're going to take all these hits， then likewise， you know what else you did？

You had to use wood and wire and like gasoline or whatever the heck it was to make the arrows。😡。

If it took you too many arrows to kill the animal， and it took too much life down。

Anytime you kill an animal in Horizs Euro dawn， you harvest it for parts。

 It's actually a robot It's animal。 You harvest this like robot animal。

 It's a robot dinosaur to be specific。 It's more's better than it sounds。 Trust me。

 So it's like the most incredible thing I've seen to my life， But like it sounds like a suck。

 So basically what you have。 Yeah， it's like amazing。

 So what you have is when you play Horizons Euroda。

 It trains you to look at a cost benefit analysis of every single time that you move forward because you kill an enemy。

 You're like， oh， I move forward， but wait a minute， I just blew my whole load of my ammo。

 which I'm gonna to need for other dinosaurs to kill。 I got， you know。

 I got back I gave an8 of my whole resource， but I got back a three。Well， it's not great。

 I got back to three， it's not a win， no， you've got to restart。

 you actually have to go back to last A point because if you do that too many times。

 then what happens is you're forced to just use your club and now you've got to run around clubbing small prey to get enough ammunition to kill the big stuff。

😡，But when you kill big stuff， you do get a lot back。

But you might have to spend more than you get back。 So it's literally ongoing math。

 that game took me like 40 hours to be。 So it was like literally like。

 I want to show my kids how to play video game。 so I didn't play video game like two decades。

 I showed them how to play this。 I played that in God of War。 They're both awesome， so。

It taught me to think in terms of cost of benefit analysis。

 So let's say that you have the physical side， which is good， right， rather than saying in your ego。

 oh， I'm getting all this attention from this person， rather than saying that。

Why don't you just ask yourself， do you really have more energy because you're with this person。

 What is the total cost of benefit analysis， Here's the problem If you get depleted of energy by that dynamic。

 you're not going to have the energy to go work on your body。

 you're not going to have the energy to work on your business， You're not like。😡，Look。

 I'll just be like very blunt， I remember another time I realized this。

 do you guys know who Alexis Red is， the Instagram model？😡。

Okay I remember like I'd had this like a very toxic dynamic going with a girl I'm dating and I saw Alexis Red at Er1 in LA and I remember feeling so toxic in my body that like I couldn't even go say hi to her I'm not even necessarily try to do anything super crazy to meet Alexis Redren but wouldn't it be cool to at least have her in your social circle I know how to get people like out of my social circle It's not really that hard I run parties I know a lot of people around LA Surely I could go say hi。

 crack a couple jokes， talk about some mutual people that we both know maybe invite her up for a shoot。

 maybe invite her up for a party。 I'd always want to meet her because I like her stories on YouTube and stuff but I couldn't go talk to her I'm like why can't I go talk to her this is so weird that's when I re wait something happened to me。

 and here's what I I called it a poison drip， say that word poison drip。It's not the overt。

 huge fight。 It's this constant， like little power dynamic。 these like the little scowling。

 the little looks of disapproval， The little looks like you're not good enough。

 to girl I went out on a date with the other day。 And she was like。😡，She was like， oh， you know。

 you have to be here at this time。 I said， okay， I'll call you an Uber。

 So girl I' I've been hooking up with okay， I'll call you Uber。 She's like， well。

 am I gonna have to wait to the restaurant then I'm like。

 yes you're gonna have to wait exactly 11 minutes。 Is that okay。 What won't you just get there。

 Just use Lyft right now， I'm gonna go buy this girl dinner。😡。

Now look at the mentality there why why is she doing that where she's saying I don't want to wait 11 minutes for you to arrive。

 She's doing it so that when I go do something nice and beautiful for her and take her for a beautiful experience。

 I took her to Gwen on Sunset Dela's a beautifuls restaurant when I go do that for her Well what's gonna happen I'm gonna feel like I'm not gonna get to left the wind land It's like I did something wrong It wasn't good enough for her Now remember earlier we talked about what's called the winter effect。

 you guys remember that when you feel like you're winning your serotonin and your dopamine。

 your brain chemistry shoots up when you feel like you're winning。

 you can come up with things to say you're creative， you move up。😡，Well。

 when you feel like your partner or the person you're dating doesn't like you or isn't thinking highly of you your w effect goes down。

 that's why my favorite take in any relationship with someone that really likes me and values me because when they don't like me and value me my w effect goes down so what I've learned to do over time is what I see that happening I have a clear boundary when she did that。

😡，I just went。Look。I'm not sellinging lift。 You're going to wait 11 minutes。 That's it。 right。

 Then she tried to scow at the restaurant。 I was so utterly indifferent。

It doesn't even go into me anymore。 Back in the day， I would let that get into my skin。

 doesn't Now I had a great dinner， was completely indifferent。 We had great physical after all good。

 all good。And then she tried the same thing again later。😡，She tried the same kind of thing。

 I weigh in differentffer， she didn't call me back for a couple days。

 great time and she's gonna to see it to my story， don't care。

 I'm not even posting the story to make a point to her。 I'm just going about my life。

 I've got to the point where I realize anybody who you interact with in life is going try to push the boundary Just say the word push the boundary。

😡，Everyone's gonna to do it at your work your boss is going to ask for more hours from you。

 they're not going give the raises if you're the boss of a company。

 you don't think every team member I have is going to come to me pushing for a raises to do less work。

 they all are all of them they're going to push and push and push and I've learned over the years at the end of that little tunnel is them leaving after you give them 95% to your five。

 they still leave salty， they'll still discard you at the end of the day， you want to know why。

Because the more concessions that you make。What winds up happening is it skews what's called the buyer seller dynamic。

 say that with me。😡，RightBecause you give away the energy which lowers you now because you lowered yourself and you made too many concessions。

 they don't value you anymore and because they don't value you， they don't engage with you。

 they're not on their best behavior with you and you're done so they will literally it'll slowly erode to that so you've got to be at a point at any relationship。

 whether it's work relationship， whether it's romantic relationship， whether it's a friendship。

 you've got to clearly know where your boundaries are， So what we're gonna to be auditing。

 this is your homework between now and Saturday， is I need you to think about this context that I created。

 I need you to do a full audit of everybody in your life， workwise romantic friendships。

 everything you've got to audit this and I need to see in writing what you're getting out of it。😡。

And what you're giving to it。 And it's great to be a giver。 I'm a giver。

 I want to give as much as I can in every situation。

 But if there's too many situations where you're giving more than you're getting back。

That is not healthy。 It's good for the joy of giving freely to be in the flow to be in high vibration。

 you should do that。 but that should be a set amount。 Okay in life。

 you should have a vice of some kind where you could be naughty and do something unhealthy。

 but it's a set amount where you don't go overboard， right， It's okay to have the small dessert。

 not okay to go crazy and wake up with a stomachacheche， You know。

 it's okay to be giving to an extent， But there's a limit to where you can't help anybody because what do they say。

 you've got to put the airplane mask on yourself first。

 Why do they always say in a plane crash the situation， Put on your mask first， why。😡。

Can't help anyone else if you're not handled。 Okay， remember， you should love everybody。

 Who's everybody included。Yourself so be aware that even if you're a very giving person。

 you can't give maximally when you're not handling yourself and what I've noticed what will always happen is when you give too much later you'll eventually explode I'd also get you to look at relationships where you're taking too much。

 so that's the other thing to audit。😡，Okay， I need to see where you're not getting enough。

 but I also need to see where you're getting too much， here's why。

I've had it where maybe I have an intern or somebody who's working for cheap or putting in too many hours。

 and they'll keep doing it and they're cool with it for a minute and they'll act like they're okay。😡。

Later， they explode。They'll front like they're cool with it。 They will explode。

 So you also have to manage what other people are getting from you and find a win win so。😡。

Homework between now and Saturday is I want you to write out on a pen and paper or in a laptop or your phone。

😡，Basically， every major relationship in your life。😡，Rate from  one to 10。

 the value that you're getting， one to 10， the value that you're giving。😡。

And I'd like you to rate it as toxic or nont， right， like energizing versus toxic。

 And I'd also like you to。Talk about in there what you're giving and what you're getting。

 and it's okay。To have a certain percentage of people that are sucking energy from you because maybe you're mentoring them。

 In that case， if you're mentoring them， what are you getting you're getting the spiritual growth。

And that aspect of charity， right， what do they say most people should give it to charity。

 What's the general rule？😡，They say 10% right when we give that 10% to charity。

 how does that and it does not have to be just straight money， it could be whatever。

 but when you give that 10% to charity， you gain spiritually but what happens if you start getting 50% of charity 100% of charity now you have nothing left to give you're not gonna keep if you give away 90% you're gonna go bankrupt and then you're not gonna to have that whole lifetime of the 10% so it's okay to have that like stupid cousin that you help but it has to be within a limit right and likewise you could be getting help to an extent if someone's helping you but don't go overboard so it's done within a limit。

 you can also have a vice I'm gonna encourage you guys to look at your vices later。😡。

And to be honest about those vices， if you have something that you're doing that's unhealthy or bad for you。

 I'm 100% supportive of that。 I think everybody should have some kind of advice any time that you do a selfhel development seminar and you don't own the vices。

 in my opinion， that is so toxic。😡，Everybody has a vice。Everybody。

 some kind of stupid thing that you do。 Okay， in my case。Instagram malls， yeah， but like， you know。

 but literally like I'm kidding。 So literally what you have is， you know， like。

 you have that kind of like naughty thing that you do and you'll have that。And that's okay。

 you can do that a bit， but it like think of a advice like a nap， okay。

 you ever take like this perfect 20 minute nap where you wake up feeling like you have more energy。

 you ever do that？You ever do that nap where you fell asleep for like four hours in the middle of the day。

 you wake up with a migraine， you can't fall asleep later that night so the migraine persists。

 and it's like three days that threw up your sleep schedule because you took too long of a nap。

You ever have that like really naughty treat and it tasted so good and you felt like you kind of like got in touch with yourself。

 so to speak， you kind of gave yourself a minute to enjoy it and even though it wasn't healthy。

 you actually felt better the next day because you got to treat yourself， you ever do that？

You ever do it where you ate too much of it and you felt inflamed and sick the next day。😡。

So what we want to do is we also want to look at things like vices and we want to look what you're getting out of it and what you're putting into it。

 The major key here is we want to be adding energy。

 notice that almost everything we're doing is to add energy remember we talked about the release muscle versus the control muscle the release muscle adds energy。

 Also these audits are going to add a lot of energy it was shocking to me when I audited this it is shocking we will audit on a scale what we weigh we will audit on a bank account how much money we have but we won't audit our relationships and what they're doing in a serious way so we've got to be auditing that and we're gonna to add to audit your whole life so you can expect us to be going through this with your groups it's gonna to be a deep audit everything from your strengths if you're in strength zone。

 what you rate it what you rate what you're doing what you rate on your path what you rate your problems we've got to really dig deep on this and get it to where you have a crystal clear picture and then we've got to be coming up with game plans and accountability within the group does that sound good。

😡，Okay， does that sound good？Okay， give me the energy back。Okay that's a boundary。 So next up， okay。

 I'll teach you the art form of not letting things get in you and how to respond to it， Okay。

 and keep it positive。 So okay， it's very powerful。

 I've had a couple breakups in the past year that have been so pleasant。😡，It's like， I break up。

 I feel better after we break up， like I don't even grieve it。It's like walking out of a movie。

 like when you walk out of a movie are you mourning the end of the movie。

 maybe like a little bit like that's really cool， wish it was a bit longer。😡，What's the next movie。

 That's how I felt in my breakups。 Why， because I enjoyed it。 Like I walked out of。

ThatThose relationships。Literally feeling energized by it， like that was cool， that was really fun。

She's amazing。 She's great， No saltiness whatsoever， had a great time， took on good energy。

 It went as far as it could out of there， right And just to wrap up that thought。

 remember I was talking about the bathtub things to wrap up that thread。

The first time that I had this epiphany， we used to sit in the bathtub。

 we'd joke around wed have fun wearing around each other seemed great vibe。

 and I noticed that it was devolving into that weird frame control battle thing and what was weird my mind I'm like I'm so happy to go back to how this was I'm so happy to just start from scratch and have no saltuliness and just joke around to have fun but the person I was with couldn't do it because the person I'm with is carrying a lot of heavy energy and they're on their best behavior at first。

 but they can't continue down that path， they can' they can't hold themselves there。

 they run out of gas with the poitivity， you ever feel that maybe you ran out of gas with your best behavior or the person that you're with。

 ran out of gas on their best behavior and I'm fine to be with them if they're gonna be at a high level but otherwise here's the thing。

😡，If I were to stay with that person， what would happen？I get depleted of energy。I'd make less money。

 I'd be less healthy， I'd have a less fulfilling life。 I'd live in less cool places。

 I'd do less cool things。 I still have them though。 don't have to go through the scary breakup。

 right。And then what happened。 But and I'd also saw the fiscal intimacy， okay。

what's the end of that path when you're depleted， what do they wind up doing at the end of that path？

They discard you， they leave you， the same person that depleted you will leave you because the things that I like you for。

 you let them take from you。😡，So instead I go， if they're going to do that， I'll just wrap it up now。

 So at first， the ratio is like 10 to 0 of positive and negative right like when you do your audit early in any relationship。

 it's like 10 to 0， it's like all positive， nothing negative。

 You're both in this like drug inducedd trance of like different brain and love chemicals。

 So you're literally just like。😡，Like at first， that's how you are。

 but slowly as that fades out and it goes to this thing where you're trying to prevent each other from leaving。

 it goes nine positive， one negative， eight positive， two negative。😡。

Maybe now you're down to five to five。 Once you start getting into like six negative to a four positive。

 you know that that relationship has cross a tipping point where it's called。

 what's the word for that？😡，How toxic。It's toxic。 It'spleleting you more than its giving。

 So at that point。I would notice that I would wait until it was toxic。

 a typical relationship pattern， first， third， amazing， second， third， okay。

 but you're kind of remembering the amazing part。😡，Third part。Nightmere。

So what I've learned is right is this transitioning from awesome to average。

 if I'm seeing that that person is not going to at least try to keep it awesome。

 I just piece out and so what winds up happening is I'll go three， four months out of 10 to a zero。

 right when it goes9 to one， I'm like， you know this is great。😡，Peace at M out。 And I do that。

 because。I wanted to try something different， I did the thing where I tried to pump life back into it for decades and it never worked。

😡，I didn't have a single success story where concessions or。You know。

 lowering the boundary or being nicer and nicer， there wasn't if it had worked one time。

I would have stuck with that， but I realized it didn't work。

 So now what I've done is I've been raising my value。 and as I'm raising my value。

 the people who I'm seeing are nicer than ever。😡，Because the value dynamics change。

I've never been treated so well in my dating life as right now。

 never been treated as good so by the time that I got my next partner。

 I'm really excited that I'm gonna be more firmly rooted in myself and saving in business like in business you guys watched me do this in the public for years you just didn't know it I would try to placate certain people for years they'll still do the discard and blame me for it I did this for years never worked There was so many times where somebody I work with when toxic and I would just scramble in my codependence to fix it。

 fix it， fix it， fix it behind the scenes doing everything to fix it。

 making presentations for them do it you know putting in 30 to 40% of my time on them why I grow their career。

😡，And still can't fix it and they still do the discard。 And I was like。

 what if two years ago that first time that I had the inclination to just end it。

 I had just ended it， I have I would have 30，40% of those two years back In my case。

 when you're dealing with multiple business relationships， that can add up quick and。😡。

If I would have learned that at age 31 or 32， I believe I'd probably have instead of me saying anyway。

 guys， I've done over 100 million in sales， I didn't keep that。

 but I did over 100 million instead what would have happen is I probably would have an 8 or $900 million in sales and I'd have over $100 million in the bank that was a 100 million mistake on my part。

 in my 30s in my prime that I can't get back because I gave and gave and gave and gave。😡，I blew it。

 I screwed up， but hope did that。 So hopefully you don't have to do that。 Okay， so basically， okay。

 hope sold cracks。 you dont have to。 You don't have to make the same mistake as me。

 You don't need to blow your 30s desperately trying to feed life into situations that aren't going anywhere。

 You don't have to。 So what I've learned now is I rapidly audit。

 I do an honest assessment of it It can be fixed。😡，I will give it a couple chances to fix it。

 I'll have a deep real conversation， try to get on the same page that's normal， that's healthy。

 that's not toxic okay having a little hiccup， getting back on the same page quick。

 if that can even make you stronger like that can literally make you come back stronger you're getting more on the same page that's beautiful I love that but if it's going toxic you got to get out so your homework is how can we get to the point where in a decade from now。

 you have engaged in in relationships and interface with people。😡，In a way where you're coming out。

Load it with energy and by the way， the people that I've seen do this effectively。😡。

Have so much energy， they're so happy， I started looking at people who I look up to and admire。

 they don't put up with this crap。They've got great people around them who admire them。One of them。

 frankly， was En Pegan。His entire staff would look up to him。

 and I'd look this isn't like to be mean or like to be salty because it would probably sound that way。

 but just to be very real。I'm like， this guy's doing five。

 he's paying his people less than I pay by people。 He's doing less for them than I do for my people。

And they think he's God。What is happening， why is this happening？

It's like the husband that just takes out the trash while the wife's hitting him in the head of the broom。

 you know， the more he takes out the trash， the more resentful she gets。

 If he actually just have a boundary， she get a track to him again right so he can get so he can get laid once so he go you don't converse it。

 It's like the wife just cooking that great food and he doesn't even come home to eat it。

 He just goes out and drinks beers with the boys。😡，Comes home， passes out。

 doesn't even appreciate the meal and then complains that she's wasting food。

 you know whatever and I'm making stereotypes there， it could be in reverse。

 maybe you're you know the guy making the food， maybe vice versa， it could be whatever。

 there's no steretype here， I'm just saying whatever it is so。😡。

🎼You don't want to get into a situation like that。 Okay， you don't want to be in that。

 You want to be in the situation where you're being fed。

 So can you guys have this audited by Saturday， You're gonna have tonight and tomorrow。 Yes or no。😡。

🎼Yes or no。泰勒用自己的例子展示了一个人如何在不健康的关系中逐渐失去自我，以及如何通过设定界限来重新夺回主动权的自尊。当时啊他和一个女孩子处于一种拧巴式的关系中。

这种关系的特点呢是持续性的权力的角逐。对方总是通过言语表情态度等方式来贬低你，暗示你的不好，久而久之，这种不断的否定，会侵蚀一个人的自信和自我价值感。就像毒液一样，一点点的滴落到你的心里。

让你感受到困惑、羞耻以及不安全感。这种状态会对一个人产生很大的负面影响。就像他看到心仪的模特啊，虽然说他自己完全有能力上前搭讪。但是由于长期处在一种。被掏空的关系中丧失了本应有的自信和热情。

这种无力感和自我怀疑，其实正是不健康关系的恶果。所以要学会设定和维护自己的底线，至关重要。就像后来和那个女孩子相处的时候啊，泰勒对于这个女孩子无理的要求改变自己的行成，或者使用冷暴力来惩罚他时。

并没有去屈服，而是坚定的维护了自己的原则，这其实也是在向对方展示自己的一个价值。当你表现出对自己的欣赏和重视的时候，别人也会跟着你的感受去看待你。相反，如果你总是妥协退让。

那别人反而会认为你这是理所应当的，甚至会变本加厉的去占你的便宜。我们每个人都应该成为自己生命的守门人。外界的声音和诱惑实在太多了。如果我们不设防，就很容易失去自我爱的本质，不是一种关系，而是一种状态。

爱是自我的成长。自我提升的最高境界。在付出和给予的过程中，我们必须要学会平衡，懂得适可而止，过度的付出，不仅仅会伤害自己，也无法真正的去帮。触到其他人。如果我们过度的损耗自己的能量和资源。

最终会陷入崩溃的局面和精疲力竭的一种困境。就像泰勒举的两个例子啊，第一个是暴饮暴食是吧？还有你的慈善捐款，自我照顾和适度付出呢？其实就像是一个硬币的两面，唯有我们去先学会关爱和尊重自己。

清晰的认识到啊自己的需求和界限。我们才能在给予他人的过程中呢，去找到一种平衡，获得真正的一个快乐和满足。我们常常要反问自己啊，这段关系或者这些行为能给我们带来什么，又让我付出了什么。

是否值得让我去为之付出的更多投入的更多。那我现在又要提到了泰勒的这个分手观了啊，他其实是展现了一种健康积极的心态去面对感情的结束，以及就是如何在关系中设定清晰的一个界限，去维护自己的价值。

他把感情看作是一段美好的体验，把它比作成一一部精彩的电影。当电影结束时，你就不会过度沉湎与失落和遗憾。而是怀着感恩的心情去珍藏快乐的回忆，然后期待着开启下一段新的旅程。

当意识到双方啊已经没有办法回到当初的这种纯粹的快乐的一种相处模式时，对方也没有办法给你积极的能量的时候，我们要果断的选择离开，而不是抱着不切实际的幻想，去迁就对方去放低自己的底线。

很多人啊会往往因为害怕孤独啊，害怕伤害对方啊而选择委曲求全。即使啊这段关系已经到了该结束的地步，其实拖着反而是一种恐惧。泰勒呢坦诚的分享了自己的过去，在这种亲密关系中犯下的错误。

总是试图去修复已经破裂的关系，或者是去不断的付出自己的时间和精力。但最终换来的是对方的背叛和指责。这其实也反映了很多人在感情和事业中的困惑，我们总是相信自己的付出，可以换来别人的欣赏和感激。

可以挽回一段关系的失衡，但现实往往事与愿违。什么是高尚的生活，就是在你生命中的某。😊，某个地方把你认为最好的东西献给你认为最优秀的人，爱一个人，首先要学会爱自己，付出和索取。

必须要建立在平等和互惠的基础上。遇到困难，与其一味的迁就，不如勇敢的面对，用行动来去捍卫自己内心的尊严。好，这就是本节课的一个内容，希望泰勒的视频，你能够喜欢我的分享我的解读，你能够喜欢我再说一点啊。

就是为了保持视频的原汁原味，我也不会给大家过度的一个解读。因为泰勒的视频啊太具有流动性了。所以视频的最后呢，我都会给大家分享我的一些见解，如果你觉得意犹未尽，或者与有什么更好的一个想法，请跟我产生链接。

可以关注我们的公众号社交光谱来群里跟我产生链接。我们群里面基本上都会有每周一次的直播讲解。那么下节课我们主要的是实操课，就是语音语调在人际关系中的重要性，以及通过如何练习不同的语调来提升社交魅力和影响。

🎼真正有魅力的人呢是懂得恰当的运用语调的变化，从而来吸引他人的注意，来赢得更多的欣赏和尊重。我相信通过下一集课视频的学习，会有更多的人意识到语调在社交互动中的重要性。

并开始主动训练和提升自己在这方面的一个技能，让你变得在社交场合中更自信，更有魅力，收获更多的成功和喜悦。🎼是交工。🎼下一。
