# 【社交光谱】泰勒《蓝图解码2.0重铸蓝图》初级班：08_8.无限话题状态：实操训练_ev

站起来了。先是。🎼这里是社交光谱，我是莱特。如果说啊词汇是语言的血肉，那么节奏和情绪就是他的心跳。牛逼的人呢能够让观众随着他的声音起伏，随着他的情绪跌宕，不是说靠着这种华丽的词藻去堆砌的。

而是对于语言本身的驾驭。即使没有任何的修饰啊，牛逼的人也能让人欲罢不能，就像一首无伴奏的说唱，凭借节奏的魔力啊，就能够引爆全场，仅仅是用了我很无聊这句话，但是语音语调表达形式，他的能量场啊就不一样。

当然，当然这并非是一蹴而就的，这需要我们克服对语言的既有机忆，跳出思维的一种定势去感受语句背后的韵律和能量，那么怎么做呢？怎么锻炼出来呢？接下来我们开始蓝图解码2。0的重铸蓝图之旅。

So say that， pop up here。I'm going to get you to try it。😡，Okay。

So first we'll do it without merging into it， okay？😡，So it's more from the head。

 Look at the difference。 like when I， when I go to speak from my head。

 which is how most of you are speaking， it's actually like。Physical violence against myself。

 That's how much it sucks what most of us are doing in this room。

 So I'm going to try to go back in my head and do it。 Okay， so stand here， O。

 I I'll try to go back in my head to do it。Hey， okay。

 sorry it's so horrible being in the headspace that we're conditioned into that I hate it so much that I don't even want to do it。

 but I'll do it。Okay。Well well， what I'll do to try to do it is I'm gonna actually try to give give me a we're getting a great video this event。

 Okay， You're okay， You're okay。 Stop stroking it。 You know what I's。 Okay， you don't gonna it。 Okay。

 so， okay， so what we have the odd shot is fine。 but can't be like like the whole event。 Like， okay。

 okay， so， okay， I love the enthusiasm。 so。😊，可。From the head。

I'm going to go back into the mode how most people are thinking。😡，Like， what do I look？

I'm being judged right now， right like you're all thinking I suck。

And then I've got to show you that I'm good。😡，It's so hard for me to think like that。So crazy。

 It's like an insane trance that most of society is in， but， okay so。Yeah。

 I really don't care what anyone like。I'm sorry， I just don't， okay， I' going a try。Okay， like。Okay。

 so I'll try to say like some self qualifying stuff。 Maybe that'll help me。 Okay， like I'm super。

 super rich。 got I got a big one， too， a big， big one。It's really impressive。I'm such a stud。

Even then I find that funny。 but okay， I'm just a rich stud with a big， long one。Okay。

 I'm trying to think how like most guys would want to look。 Okay， I've got like a cool house。

 I've got a big fat house。And I got fans， I'm super cool， okay。I'm trying to think like。

Super awesome。 Okay， I'm trying to think how how people think， okay， so。I can normally do it。

 It's weird。 I'm kind of locked in right now。Okay I got to go with my head。

I got to get out of my body， I got to go in my head。It doesn't feel good， I don't like it。

I need the audience to think I'm cool。I'm not good enough。

I don't know if I'm going to be a good example。I just want to do a good example for the audience。

Can you see me going like 20% in my head。Can you feel it or no， Can I want to show you energy。 Okay。

 I need this I want to show I trying to think how you might feel now。 I don't know how you feel now。

 but how you may feel。 Okay， you look pretty good， actually， But okay， so like when I'm up in front。

Maybe you could call me up and I could show you how most of you guys look like。

 say like command me to come up and like。Yeah。I'll be like， I hope I don't get pig， I' be like， here。

 come up here and show me Owen。You come up here okay。

I'll see how he looking down on the ground when he came up， that's not good。Okay， so。

Like say you tell me scream A。Like like yell as loud as you can。呃。That's loud， right？Not I like this。

呃。对的。Right， right roll reversal in the text。 So by the way， John， when you write down。

 you get to do a couple of I stories， put roll reversal and so people understand what it is。

 Otherwise， that's not a good look。 Okay， so like I'm like， I got a bigco， right， yeah。So， okay， so。

Yeah。So okay， so when you go in the head， you'll see it。

 even if I'm not doing the best job because I'm not thinking right now。

 it's hard for me to reengage that hamster， but I'll try to caffenate that thinking hamster at some point。

 and essentially what's going to happen is，😡，You're going to see it。

You're going to see the person in their head and there's very little power behind it。

It takes away the power from what you're saying。 It makes them very uncompelling。 Okay。

 so from the head， just be like， merge in the word， say it from your head。Merge。Okay。

 you don't need to do it like even quiet， just do how you'd normally do， but from your head。😡。

You can go ladder though I'm sure you're not that quiet in your regular life。

Is that how quiet you are in regular life， I it really， It's vicious。 What do you do for work。

 I'm an administrative assistant。 Okay， so that's there。 How much you make you're doing that。

I'll make a minimum wage right now， okay， so see。Would I look at you like what's funny？😡。

Like I'm like， like I saw how cool he looked a minute ago。

 and I'm not saying you get paid to be cool， but let's also be honest。

 having great social skills and being able to represent yourself in a certain way。 I mean， frankly。

 just look at the presidential debate。 It's not just going to be the person with the best ideas。

 right， It's going to be some but they're going to get voted in by the way they're communicating in large part。

Because frankly， they can't even talk that much about ideas in a presidential debate because they've got to talk more in platitudes and in certain cases。

 they've got to kind of appeal to a base， I understand this。How it is， but it's interesting。

E give me that okay， how much percent is he in his head versus his body right now？

I'd say he's 80% in his head 20% of the body。 Okay， show me again。Okay， now what I want to do。

 go merge。M。Let it let it resonate in your body。 I'm not Mike right now， by the way。LED it， I mean。

 I mic to my camera， but not to a speaker。 I think I don't think I， okay， maybe I am。

 It's been like two， three times in my career。 I'm like， I don't even have speakers right now。

 The people in the back are like。Right because the speakers are not didn't even know。Like look at me。

 that said I may。A couple times， usually no。 So okay， okay， so you can you see as inner cycling。 Now。

 by the way， what we're going to get into later， this is the craziest part。

 maybe the craziest element of this event。What you're seeing there is a physical manifestation of his ability to be creative。

😡，When he's thinking of that million dollar idea， it's the aborted fetus， million dollar idea。

 just like how it's the aborted fetus vocal projection。😡，What's up like that there。

 the way in which I'm being expressive is completely congruent to the degree of intensity。

 focus and liberty and freedom in my mind with creating ideas。My ability to create new content。

 new business ideas is exactly like what you see here with my speaking。

 And the reason why is because this is not a technique， this is like a state of mind in effect， okay。

 it's a state of mind。😡，Now， what I'm going to say to you is that you are so much more creative than you realize。

 Here's what I mean。 When you think of the dreams that you have， how creative are your dreams。

How creative， how creative， give some examples。I can I can give an example。 I mean。

 some of my dreams are pretty mundane。 Like I'm just。

 it's just like regular life maybe different than regular life， but relatively the same。

 But some of the dreams that I've had， you ever see the movie avatar by James Cameron。

That's like a 5% version or even 1% version of the scope of my imagination。😡，Okay。

 like I've had dreams where I'm seeing like like I've been some kind of like Norwegian fjord with like castles everywhere with like Brazilian jungle combined with like the different patterns that I'm seeing or it's just outrageous。

 the things I'm seeing if I could just draw some of this stuff。

 I could make the craziest movie or the craziest art or something like that right and the plot lines that will happen in my dreams and the differences in perspectives。

 the way things merge and change， the creativity is just unbelievable。

 what the mind can come up with。😡，Now if I can come up with that in my dream and if you can come up with that in your dream。

 know maybe you're not dream about castles in a fjord。

 but you'd have your own version of what you're dreaming about that's just completely wild and free what does that mean that creativity is in you and it's been roed from you through your interaction with the low vibration energy society in which you live I know this because it was robbed from me and now I see a lot of that same creativity from my dreams now is in me and I can go use that to create things including money or to meet somebody or to get a date。

 but in addition to that I can use it to create much more profound things and the speed at which I create it's blinding I mean other people around it they're jawd but what am I doing you know either a jawwd because they're creating from the control muscle from the control muscle you're not gonna like if I was to be that blinding quick from control that would be crazy。

😡，But I'm doing it from release。So of course， it's going to be outrageous。That's your issue there。

 you go Hey that there。 I've been released。 See， you it's like if you're taking a crap。

 you're trying to take a crap by clenching your butthole and then you're trying to push it out。

 So of course， if like if a little spaghetti thing shot out， that would be normal， right。

 But if you just like like that， it's just like。😡，Okay， so when I'm public speaking。

 like you're working harder to speak than I am， I'm working the least hard of anybody here in my speaking。

😡，I'm doing the least also in my social skills going out， meeting people， getting a date。😡。

I'm working the least， I'm the least nervous。 I care the least。 I'm the most indifferent。

 I'm doing the least as far as effort。 And yet to the outside world， it's like， this guy's so funny。

 How's it come up with， This guy's hilarious， Oh now he's making out with her， too。 This is crazy。

 You know， But， but like in my mind， it's just like。😊，Yeah。あね。I'm doing nothing。

You guys are trying way hard。Like I'm looking at you guys， I'm like， you're trying so hard。

 like this's so cute。It's doing's what you're doing is your tongue chains to the ground and trying to fly。

You're like， I'm going to get it and you put the chains there。You put the chains there。

So you've got to undo it， so hey that power， which somebody at home seeing that in the video。

 they're not going to fully feel that right I remember seeing Anthony Robins speak up close and when he would walk by me I would just feel raw electricity coming off them right and it was a very surreal experience。

 having Anthony Robins just sitting there up in my face talking to me and it's like something out of a weird dream。

😡，It's so bizarre。Meaning somebody who's in release because we're not used to seeing that in our society。

 right， We're not accustomed to seeing someone who is not thinking they're expressing freely。

 They're not filtering themselves。😡，There there's a creativity that's there They're not accustomed to that right Like you were at dinner with me the other night now I'm not talking to you coming up to you like this。

 now I was probably sitting there Ser of my fucking phone， I was exhausted but you know。

 but it's like okay， so there's a differences there now I'd see that and I think how are they doing this Like why is he like what's what level is this gone。

 What's he doing I don't get it。😡，I don't get it， how do you make that happen。

 how do you make the electricity？😡，Where does that electricity come from。

 Why is it that when he speaks， I can feel little pulses in my body？😡。

And there was little pulses is what's holding the attention， that's what's captivating。

 you can feel it in the body， even if you're bored， even if you're bored， even if you're bored。

 even if you're bored， even' even if you're bored， even if you're，😡，Even if you're bored。

 even if you're bored， even if you're bored。Even if you're bored。

 I could hold your attention for five hours， just saying even if you're bored， even if you're bored。

 even if you're bored。😡，A are you bored， even if you're a board， even if you're bored。

 you know you've got to have the perfect thing to say to hold attention。

 you better have a great line to hold somebody's attention。 You better have an incredible line。

 and an incredible line， you better have a perfect thing to say you better know the right technique you better have that script written out。

 you know all the best people have a script， you know， they've got a great script。

 the best and most captivating people because you got to do what works， So you take what works。

 and you repeat it， you got the same results。's like science experiment。 It's like science。

 it's a science， it's a science， it's science， even if you're bored， even if you're bored。

 it's a science。 you understand even if you were a bored， it's a science， it's a science。😡。

It's science。 okay， it's science。It's science， okay， science， okay， it's science。

 even if you're bored， it's science， you've got to have the perfect thing to say you could never hold somebody's attention。

😡，You've got to control everything。Okay， to get the precious， okay， you've got to control。😡。

Even if you're bored， you've got to control everything like what I'm doing right now。

 I'm controlling everything， I'm really thinking hard about this， I'm really trying hard。

 I'm trying so hard to hold your attention right now， it's so difficult。

 I'm losing energy from this It's so difficult， can't you see my energy going down。😡。

My energy is going down because when you have to control everything。

 your energy goes down and you've got to control everything right。

 don't you have to control every little thing and you don't control every little thing。😡。

It's not going to work， You're never going to hold the attention。

 I'm never going to get your attention， I'm never going to get your attention。😡。

I've got to have every word picked perfectly。😡，If I don't say something so profound。

 I'm never going to hold your attention。 I have no idea how I'd hold your attention for many hours without the perfect thing to say。

 I don't know what I do。😡，I might lose your attention。 You might walk out of here。

 You'd have something better to do。 You start looking at your phone。

 You start craving to look at your phone right now。 So I have to have everything scripted。 I mean。

 in the last 10 minutes， I made about four entire sentences for 10 minutes。😡。

But they're pretty good for sentences， right？😡，What， yeah， right， So you better have a system， right？

and I can do this all day and by the way， if I do this all day。

 I will have more energy by the end of it than at the start why because I've in released most people are in a suppressed consciousness state they're trying to control everything and for that reason they're running out of energy and they can't compete once you understand this。

 you will steamroll those people not only will you steamroll them but you will give them as much regard as in is searoll steamrolling over a bug okay like they're like youve better not mess at me。

 I'm a big bug right and you're like and just searolls over the bug you won't even know it exists。😡。

The bug thinks that you're paying attention is like it's trying to get me， I'm a big bug。

 I'm a big bug， yeah， you're like。You didn't even see the bug and just seabroed it。

 You didn't even have the gas now。 You're just laying back。Crushing everything。

But the funny thing is when you searoll the bugs， do you even care， No。

 you're just chilling driving around the searoller。

 you're not even going to care that other person who competed against you in business。

 you were their whole world， just like that seamroller was the whole world to the bug to you。

 it's a bug， you didn't even know what you're doing。😡。

I can't tell you how many times people come to me for my industry they're like。

 you guys are like the big boys， we watch everything you do and I'm like。

 you know what my reality is I'm like I'm not thinking about this， I'm just like， oh， I'm at it。😡，So。

Okay。So understand you have control muscles and release muscles。 And when you release。

 you merge into the word， merge into it。 And what will happen is as you're speaking。

 you're going to feel little pulses。😡，Of electricity。 And as you're doing it， boom， boom， boom。

You're putting that， putting it， putting， putting， putting， okay？😡。

You're putting it in the other person， you understand buth but， but， okay， you're going to feel it。

I remember I'd see this right really high level stand comedians have this too like Bill Burr。

 Joe Rogan， I've seen them live， it's electric。 okay。

 these people are master craftsmen in front of a crowd。😡，I mean， the sound of comedians too。

 like it's on another level。 They're really in the wrong industry because if they move to self helpub。

 they make so much cash。 but they're like， oh make my 200 bucks on stage at the laugh factory is' like cool。

 But that doesn't mean。 Buts true。 So， some of them can do Netflix special get wealthy from it。

 But they're world class speakers， many of them in a niche that doesn't pay a ton。

 it's a commoditized niche for entertainment。 We tend to pay low for entertainment。

 We pay higher to fix a big problems。 So that being the case what you have some of them get super rich off though。

 too。 So what you have here is I understanding， let go merge in the word。 let's do some exercise。

 Now， I set the bar a little bit off the wall here for you。

So you're probably not feeling too good right now， but the way you've got to be thinking about this。

😡，Is rather than looking at what I did here。😡，Don't go in competition with me， don't do it。

Don't do it。You've got to be in a collaborative frame， okay？😡。

So I'll have you walk around here for a moment。 And what I'd like you to do is just try to work the crowd saying you're going to get bored or things like that。

 Just show me roughly what that would look like。 Okay， we could even put a little mic on。😡。

So just show me， just show me roughly or maybe the next person， if not him。 So ho down。Now。

It's okay to goof it up。Don't be afraid to goof it up。

And just hold on this thing and the cool thing is if you goof it up we're just gonna work on it。

 it'll be super cool when you work on it anyway， it doesn't have to be the whole crowd either though so okay yeah。

 you're good bro so basically what you have is you're going do like some version but your own version of what I did and play with it and then I'll give you feedback and I'll guide you okay okay。

😡，啊都对对。How's the projection？He's speaking from the head of the body。Okay， keep going。

I keep talking this， you' bored you bored keep imagine listening to this for four days。ok。Okay。

He's in his head， he cares， he cares。I keep talking like this。And over and over。He， are you bored。

 you're going to get bored， but keep saying all you。

All things things try changing it now here's a few things to change try changing。

 you remember the exercise we did before where you change the variation in cadence or delivery style。

 try that。You're going to get bored， like keep talking like this， you're going to get bored。

Are you bored？Okay， press pause now already， even though he's not close to where he needs to be。

 was that easier to watch than a second ago okay， he needs a lot of work， but it's easier okay。

 keep doing what you're doing， you're getting warmer。😡，Get bored keep going like this。

 they're gonna get good Now， by the way， pause。 Now， as you're gonna come up with different cadence。

 if you try to memorize the cadence， it's not gonna come to you。 there's too many to remember like。

 okay， singing one the quiet one this It's too many。 So it's like a millipede walking。

 If the Milede starts thinking it's gonna trip on itself。

 You're not gonna get this from control at this level that we're gonna get you to this weekend。

 you can't fix it from the mind， you're not gonna get there You're not gonna get there So the only way you will is when you let go。

 you've got to just let it come to you。 And one of the next exercises will be how to let it come to you。

 So let it come to you。 by the way， as you're seeing me speaking and I'm showing you these different methods。

 are you seeing more now what I'm doing and how I'm doing it most of all I'm speaking at this point is just so you can see me doing it as I isolate the different aspects。

 Okay so I'm not just speaking just to speak at this point。 keep adding that aspect。

 keep playing with it。 you're doing great。😡，Louder， though， louder， way louder。Okay pause there go。

Go ladder， ladder。Lader， you guys deal with him？一。Okay， now do it again。Deal with them。You， you， you。

Harder brother， all with them。All out loud as you can。

He's can you see the selfciling Okay he's afraid he's gonna to mate。 That's why he's doing that。

 there's a mating fear。 A lot of this there's a sexual background to it。 there's a mating fear。

 He's afraid that he might mate with the alpha male's partner and that he could be killed。

 it's a human caveman mechanism。 by the way， that caveman mechanism also sa you from getting rich。

 Do you know that？😡，You're afraid that if you get rich， you'd have a problem。 Okay。

 there's people that are so afraid to stand out。 They don't learn to read。 You show them a book。

 even though they're smart。 They're like， no， no， no， no， no， no， no。

 they don't want to learn to read Okay， because they're afraid that they learn to read。

 They get smarter and then they got smarter。 They'd be killed。 It's a deep fear。

 It's that's at one of the lower levels that you could be in。 Okay， La again。呃。Okay。

 you're still okay， show me as loud as you could it your relative was going to die if you didn't get loud。

Okay， now at that loudness， do the thing you're doing。No， as loud as you can do the same。

 proceed to do what you were doing before， you're going to get bored all that。

Proceed to do that at the loudest as you can。😡，呢个就系最紧嘅嘅铺。You're not as loud， louder。You know。

 if I keep talking like this。You' got to get bored， that's not the good。

You're going to get bored if I keep talking like this， it's only natural， you know。

 more variation now， if I keep talking like this， you're going to get bored， you know？😡。

If you talking like this， you're going。More variation， more power。Go as crazy。

 you can't go all out like a rock star crazy keep like this。So why would I keep talking like this？

りがと。Getting better。 Yeah， getting warmer。 I like it。 Okay， now， so by the way。In dating。

 if I'm standing beside。You know， a quote， quote， competitor。A competing guy talking to somebody。

 If I have more energy and the things I'm showing you coming out of me。

I'm the one who's most likely to get traction。😡，This is why even if I'm not 62。

 I can compete against someone who's62 easily， very easily。😡，Very， very easily。

And you will see this consistently。😡，Notice how you felt energetically if I'm speaking versus as a newer speaker。

 how you feel energetically the draw， there's a word for that you've heard it before it's called attraction。

 At is not just opposite sex， it's also anything that you're just attracted to right or same sex or whatever it's not just the sexual orientation It's what you're attracted to energetically so a lot of the time in dating。

 we think that we have to get attraction physically or sexually。

 but it can also be an energetic attraction which later is parlayed into physical intimacy okay it can move to that。

😡，So I'm going to walk with you and do it with you a little bit。😡。

Just to warm you up a little bit further， okay？😡，I I'll just repeat。

 you're gonna to get bored again again。 Okay， you're going to do with me。 You're going to get bored。

 get bored， You're going to get bored say with me， you say with me， You are good enough。😡，Get。

 get bored， okay。So what am I doing there， I'm going to sync him up， okay？😡，Work with me or okay。

 you got to come， okay？Okay， got it。 wake up， say wake up， wake up， Okay， wake up， wake up， wake up。

 wake up， You're not gonna get bored。 You're not gonna get bored。 Okay。

 so I want to move him to my I want to sick him up to my energy level。 Okay。

 you're not going get bored。 You're not going Now what I need to do is merge into the word。

 say with me merge。😡，Into the word。 So you're used to speaking from the head。

 How does it feel when you do that， Okay， what's different about it than the feeling。

I don't have to think， okay， great。to the， say that now youifled feel out it feels when I give you the permission and then don't selfciifled。

 get the feel for it in your body。 Don't think when I stop， you'll start thinking。Go a great see。

 So let me sync you， but then feel the feeling and then maintain it when I stop， Okay， a Okay。

 the challenge now when I stop， do you feel yourself getting nervous for a split second okay。

 do you yes or no， Okay， so it's called social awareness， I can see he wasn't telling you， Okay。

 so okay， but that's a good thing at this point go Okay， good， good， okay， give a hand for that。

I have a seat。👏So。Okay， so。Oh， I can grab it。Thanks， so。Do this with me。Mge。Into the word。Go。Okay。

 now when we draw it out， it's a bit easier with staccado。

 it'll you'll feel yourself coming in and out of your head。 What's up？😡，How are you， How are you。

 How are you doing， How are you doing， What's up， What's up， how are you doing， What's going on。

 What are you going to do， How's it going to go， What's gonna happen， How are we doing。😡，Okay。

So you can still so you'll notice when you draw it out， it's a little bit easier to merge into it。

 but when in Soccado， it's harder， so just keep yourself outside， say out of your head。In my body。

 in my body。In my body。In into my body。Okay， so get in your group and practice speaking from that paradigm right there。

 Okay， right there， merge in the word， merge in the world。 You're gonna get bored。

 You're going to get bored。 You're not gonna get bored。 You won't get bored。

 Use to getting out of your head and merge in the world。 That create what's called electricity。

 iss that with me electricity。 Okay， hop up。 Let's see do it right now， okay。😡，🎼我们需要全身心的投入对语言的驾驭。

关键是要学会融入语言，摆脱思绪的困扰，达到一种近乎忘我的一种状态。首先我们要全神贯注啊，通过冥想式的练习，清空杂念，专注于当下的语言，融入语言意味着要像对待爱人一样，全身心的拥抱自己的语言。

在节奏和韵律中啊达到身心合意的境界。这种状态呢和性爱中的高潮相似，都要人们暂时忘却自我，沉浸在当下的感受之中，虽然说重复的动作，可以帮助我们进入一种近乎催眠的一种状态。但是我们一定要全身心的投入。

正是因为在做爱做的事情中，可以摆脱思绪的困扰或者片刻的解脱和释放压力，要达到这种境界呢，肯定是需要练习和勇气的对吧？我们要克服对于别人眼光的恐惧，克服对于自我的一种怀疑。

其实每个人内心啊都有一个沉睡的表达者，渴望在言语中绽放，这需要我们一次次的在融入语言的。尝试中去寻找感觉。还有就是我们可以看到上台来被锤炼的小哥呢。

他一开始有着沉迷于自我批判和他人的眼光的一种焦虑的状态中，沉迷于自我批判的状态下啊，人们往往过度关注自己。在他人眼中的一种形象，总是担心自己不够好，害怕被批评。这种担忧导致他在表达时的小心翼翼。

唯恐说错话或者是暴露自己的一个弱点。他拼命想给人留下一个很酷的印象，希望获得他人的一个认可。但是这种刻意的伪装，实际上会削弱表达的力量，让人感到极其的不真实和不自然。因为观众能够感受到背后的思绪。

以及他的内心的不自信。而泰勒告诉我们要跳出思维的桎梏，全身心的投入当下的自由状态。相比之下啊，当一个人能够放下自我批评，专注于当下的时候，将身心完全投入到表达的时候，他的言语呢肯定会充满感染力。

他能够带动这种氛围。因为这种状态下。表达不再是刻意的表演，而是发自内心的流露，表达着与当下的体验啊结合一体。因为语言啊不再是符号，而是情感的一个载体。这不仅仅适用于演讲，也适用于我们生活中的方方面面。

啊，无论是在工作中还是在社交中，还是在去追求我们梦想的路上，我们往往最大的阻碍，就是自己的思维，被各种的焦虑啊、担忧啊，自我怀疑所困。我们没有办法尽情的挥洒自己的才华去展示自己啊。

但如果我们学会不再被这些思想给绑架，全身心的投入到我们当下的每一个瞬间，我们就能够发现啊，真正阻碍我们发挥创造力和社交潜能的，就是我们自己的心态和自我的射限。

所以说如果我们想要从思想的这个束缚中解脱出来的话，我们既要去突破社会性的一些限制。其实社交领域的成功呢，很大程度上是取决于我们个人的沟通能力和表达方式并。不是我们想法本身的这种优劣，大多数人的思想。

习惯于按部就班，不敢去打破常规，处于一种低震动的能量。这种状态呢压抑了我们与生俱来的创造力。我们每个人内心都有一个充满无限创意的梦想空间。但现实生活中呢。

这种创造力往往被自我设限给阻碍了制约我们发挥潜能的根本原因呢，就是我们的一个心态。有些同学呢过于关注技巧的学习，希望通过掌握一些秘诀啊，来提升自己的魅力和影响力。在很多时候呢真正起作用的。

并不是说你的这些技巧的优劣，而是个人表达和表达的一种方式，一个人的自信、热情真诚、自由的流动，往往比他说什么更能够打动人心。但问题就是大多数人在生活中啊不敢去这么去做。他们的思想受限于各种条条框框。

处于一种低能量的状态下，这种状态就像是我们自己啊把自己锁在地上。我们渴望。着飞翔，但却不敢挣脱枷锁，释放我们的创造力和社交潜能，就必须要打破这些思维枷锁。还有就是我们的吸引力和影响力的本质呢。

就是关于一个自我的一个放飞，而不是说去控制一切。当一个人全身心的投入，将自己融入语言时，就能够产生一种特殊的能量场来引起他人的注意力。而那些试图通过刻意控制和完美的台词来吸引别人注意力的时候呢。

往往恰得其反，失去了说服力。当一个人过于关注技巧和细节的时候，其实他的注意力是被分散的。他不断的在审视和批判自己，生怕哪里表现的不够好。这种内在的焦虑和紧张呢，往往会通过我们的言行来去传递出去。

其实让我们这些跟他接触的人呢感觉十分不自在。有一个吸引力的人呢能够在听众的身上呢感受到一种特殊的电流和脉冲，往往能让人在潜意识里呢赶到你的一种能量场。所以说。更多的呃表达者的状态呢并非是语言。

而是你的本身所给人带来的能量。与那些拘泥于技巧和控制的人相比呢，如果说你达到泰勒所说的这种境界，就能够不费吹灰之力的碾压对手，你不需要通过伪装和算计，反而能够以最本真的方式去赢得尊重。

这种状态呢是一种完全的投入和释放。就你就不会被我该说什么，我该怎么说，这些思绪呢所困扰，所以说不要去尝试控制每一个细节，而是让你的意识随着你的语言自由起伏。在这种状态下，我们的能量是充沛的。

我们的语言是流畅的，仿佛这些就是与生俱来的。同样的一个道理呢，也适用于我们的约会和其他的一个社交场所，很多人啊过于关注外表和条件，认为只有长相出众或者身材高大的人才能获得异性的好感。

但实际上啊一个人散发的能量和自信，往往比外表更具有吸引力。只要你不是太。差，只要你去稍微的倒腾一下自己，注意自己的衣品。那当你全然接纳自己的时候啊，敢于展现真实的一面时。

你的独特的魅力呢自然就会彰显出来。所以我们要去练习融入语言。这本质上呢是一种释放天性，回归本真的一个过程。就像一个喝醉的舞者，反而能够爆发出这种惊人的战斗力一样，最全大家知道吧？好的。

这就是本节课的一个内容。下节课我们将讲讲泰勒用自己的亲身经历啊，揭示了很多人在关系中常犯的一个错误，并提出了一个新的一个思路，就是说去建立正常的人际交往的一个边界去追求平等互利的关系。

这就是关于维护长期关系的一个内容。如果说你已经陷入了一段不平等的关系啊，但是你又不知道怎么做，你也可以通过社交光谱的公众号来找到我们，把你的情况跟我们讲一讲，我们会帮你一起梳理这段关系的脉络。

每一段关系，无论是工作。友情还是爱情，它都存在着一个能量交换的一个过程。理想的关系呢应该是双方都能从中获得滋养和成长。但现实生活中呢，很多关系会慢慢的变得不平衡，一方过度付出，另一方过度索取。

最终导致关系的破裂。双方呢都十分的精疲力竭。我们要构建平等互利的关系呢，就要从一开始去掌握正确的一个社交技巧。我们这里有一门专门聊天的课程，就是谈话掌握。针对于现代网聊的场景。

用一部电影的时间告诉你怎么去开场，怎么去让话题无限的聊下去，怎么让女人主动向你吐露自己内心的需求，怎么去顺其自然的去进行邀约，结合我们课程答疑的社群呢，可以让你迅速拿到结果。

想要的兄弟呢可以去找社长咨询，导致这种失衡的根本原因，就是缺乏健康的边界。当一个人太过于迁就对方放低自己的底线的时候，就会失去吸引力和。🎼动权对方会习惯性的挑战你的底线，试图控制你，最终失去对你的尊重。

正如泰勒所说的啊，希望你们不必犯和我一样的错误，这是一个前辈对后辈的一个忠告，也是一个智者对所有人的期许。我们下节课见更多的精彩内容，请关注公众号社交光。
