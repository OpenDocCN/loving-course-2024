# 【社交光谱】泰勒《最后一搏计划》人工翻译版：05_5.行动势能 Vs. 找借口势能--01_5.行动势能 Vs. 找借口势能_ev

Hey it up， it's O from real social dynamics we're kicking it out in San Diego。

 California this evening very late after a crazy crazy boot camp and what I want to share with you today is the value at least if you find it valuable I've not just waiting until you get to the bar or club or venue that you're going to but engaging in little short momentum building conversations with every girl that you have the chance to talk to on your way there our lesson right now is we're gonna go to the club and is to wake up our minds so the way that I came across this lesson was that I've had too many bad nights so the question I'd ask you is have you had enough bad nights。

To me to the point where you can recognize hi there。I love you almost。Okay， where do you come from。

 where's that。Are you French。 No， I'm not French， Where do you come from， I'm Russian。

 Nice pleasure to meet you。 Thanks。 Okay bye。Okay， so what I do is。On my way there。

I'm just going to keep doing that。I do it because I've had enough bad nights。

 so it's this is a funny topic because I feel that。All those bad nights。

 you think that you're not learning anything but what you're learning is what not to do and all these things that you're learning to not do eventually add up and help you because these habits that I have I never would have started them if I hadn't had enough bad nights say I had 30 bad nights Well I'm walking in the club I just want to go to the club I don't want to stop people and talk to them on the way of the club so I wouldn't do it but because I've had so many horrible nights in my life I can recognize the pattern that what I talk to people on my way there I do better because I recognize that I've had enough pain that I've accepted it you do the thing where you don't floss for a while even if you brush your teeth and then you go to the dentistt you at gingivivitis and then you've got to like floss it for like two months after and it bleeds for like two fucking months after you hit a point where you're like you know what I'll floss it's like this annoying thing to do but you just hit a point where you're willing to do it So that's kind of the point that I hit with this like I'm just gonna open on the street on the way there because I've seen that I do better you when I do that。

Who are you Okay then all right， okay， well then I gotta let you go even just something as stupid as that right Like that's it's gimmicky game like that's not even good like just like I can't let you come on like you know it's like it's not even like smooth game but that's telling the part of my brain we're socializing now okay we're socializing So it's valuable insof far as my mind is beginning to realize like okay take off the business owner cap。

 The thing where you call your staff and mediate different tasks going on and you know draw boundaries here and handle this here like that whole thing right or video editing or whatever is I'm doing that's off now and now it's time to。

Be an idiot right now it's time to do pick up。 And so I've got to tell my brain like， you know。

 it's time to do that。 Now， the hard part about it for me， especially is that I。I find it。

I'm so task oriented that I start thinking pick up a task right I'm like。

 okay now the task dude like that and that's not socializing socializing is the task mode is off we turn that off and we're going to have some fun so we switched from like this kind of like task orientation to a fun。

Orientation， you follow。Okay， with each people that go by。

 we just do opens and we lower our criteria for success。Like even simple little short stuff。You know。

 it's like。Hello， hello。Simple okay， you see that by the way， when you're by yourself。

 you won't even have to deal with that as much because you know we got a four- person group in cameras right now so it's like you know it's like you will get it more and the truth this proper game with them is I would have walked with them and I would have chat it and I can do that to an extent but even a simple high five what it also does is it teaches my brain it's okay to have that happen。

You're still cool so because it's almost like， you don't want you go to jump in a pool。

And you don't want to do it you' ever have that happen like it's like， you know。

 then when you just jump in， you just don't care， so that part of that is jumping in the pool。

 like having it go kind of high there。Okay， part of that is。

Part of that is jumping in the damn pool Okay， so what we'll do right now is we'll walk to the next venue and on the way there I want you just to observe what I'm doing and then I'm going to get you doing it okay。

 so I want to int still this as a habit。Okay， and this is like your first habit。

 does that make sense， this is like this is your very first habit， essentially your winning habit。

It's your it's your warm up yeah， but it's like the warm up before the warm up everybody's like you wait wait you're on the mission Oh in the Yes。

 are you go to Om。Hello， hi， I'm going this way What you you are going this way， Do you have to go。

 Yeah， I'm going， Okay， hug。I love you will miss。Now one time。可以。我把了。

The way that I got most of the habits that I've learned in success with women is from years and years of horrible。

 horrible nights where I wasted hours and hours of my time， so for me when I'm walking to a club。

 in my mind I make a connection between all those nights that I spent over a decade and a half going out to meet women where I walk out to a club and the whole way that I'm walking there I'm seeing girls that I want to talk to。

And as I'm seen them， I'm making up excuses about how I'm just going to wait until I get to the club this three years。

 okay， so now by the time that I get to the club， I have so much excuse making momentum that I carry that excuse making momentum into the venue itself now in addition to that。

As I'm walking there， Im mean this kind of silent， introspective sort of headspace。

 And then when I get out to the club， it's like boom， boom， boom， boom， boom， boom boom， boom。

 And it's like overwhelming to me to the point where I just wander around Now。

 at this point in my life。I don't feel that as intensely， of course， I've done this for a long time。

 it's more natural to me， but if you're watching this and you're new to just randomly approaching different girls and it makes you nervous or。

 you know， you feel hesitation or anything like that which almost everybody does when they're getting going with this something that you might want to consider is literally just approaching women as you're on your way to the club。

 They're on the move and it's a large groups。 The chance of them stopping is almost nil but it's still good that you see。

In my mind， I was thinking I should tell them to walk with them。

 but I almost like that you're going to get the harsh snub because now that you have the harsh snub。

 your first harsh snub is over with。No， it's done， you've been snued， you know right， so it's like。

 okay， and then you just keep going。Okay， and so its kind of it's kind of liberating because your brain's like。

 oh， I can be snub， you know， there's some up here。

 you can stop and talk for a second and then we just keep going or you can even try to move them to the club with us like here come with us they'll say no but you just try it you know。

 what's what's up in in in in。那个。this stuff No we're gonna park where are you guys going Where's that park I guess we're not you're seeing either I understand that's fine Okay just get my and by the way。

 if you look at those girls there sometimes a rejection is your fault right when you see the vibe of those girls I it even in the reality that fun guys that approach them can you see that're like' like it's like of course you don't like because you suck So don't even read into stuff like that right it's like what what could you into it I should have been more negative。

Like you know there's not really a lot to learn， I'm going to get you to do something kind of kind of weird。

 but just for fun， try to get these three to come to park with us even though they're clearly on their way they're not even dress for it。

 but just go do it， try to drag them there and be like we're going to park just to get you in gear。

这个。我如果。Birdday is your birthday， it was my friend's birthday。Awesome， that's cool。 Yeah。

 it was my birthday but party and I'll take it home with got it good to see guys little simple like that is like that's how I like to do it。

 you know， it's like those girls come birthday party They're not the kind of girls that should even be going apart right it's like you know but even just be like to I might even be like come to park did you guys try saying that Yeah and then where they say' like like going Yeah now the thing is you can go follow them down and all this but there's better girls at park So why would we get stuck on that There's something be for going to the damn。

 sometimes I'll do that sometimes I don't spend this much time on it。 but I just feel it's like。

I don't know why not I've just noticed a strong correlation that by doing this it's building action taking momentum rather than excuse taking momentum I also feel like it also starts from the the beginning of the day when you wake up and you per see that girl when you walk outside Yeah don' Yeah and then again right here no excuse making momentum action taking momentum are you guys here。

ペス。So that there is like dad's probably the most unresponsive of any of them so far。

It's like my mind just comes off that so fast。You know， I don't even give that。

 I don't even warrant that a lot of。Thought。Okay， like my mind is on to the next within milliseconds like if I wasn't talking about that。

 I would have forgotten about already how long would you invest in something if I think it's just this like kind of stuck situation。

 I don't want to burn。You know， a whole bunch of time on it， I just， you know。

 keep going where do you come from， you like French Italian Italian， are these your friends， Nice。

 Good to meet you。So if you look at that one there， I was dumbed。

 I really thought that was a French roll so there what I'm doing is like I can sit in that and I can try to work it and I can see who the boyfriend is and is that really her situation into it and I can do all that but I'm trying to go to the bar so I'm only gonna really stick long in one that would be worth it you know this would even be a perfect one because like because we're all crazy。

Yeah。That's even perfect because even better they're fucking leaving right。

 so it just keeps us moving to where we're going without having even sitting in it right if you're stay exactly now think of too of how different this is than just walking in isolation to the venue you see what I'm saying right getting more to your head now I don't want you to be afraid of walking quickly to the venue sometimes let's say it's getting too late I'm not gonna get in。

I just go the venue is it's not a hard fast rule， it's just something that I frequently do。Okay。

 yeah it' it's a warm up it's like if you're taking an improv class that you have little warmup things that you'll do before you go on stage。

 you might do this thing called crazy as wherere like1，2， three， four， five， six， seven。

 eight with your hands stuff like that so I just do this to just get talkative and to tell my brain okay。

It's not work time， it's socialized time So you see how even now just from these couple interactions we're already shifting to be like oh。

 it's time to socialize and what this does is on the way to the club or you know the bar， the venue。

 wherever you're going in particular， whatever it is。

 you'll find that it's a little bit quieter and you can just do little short approaches。

And as you're doing these little short approaches， your  mind can kind of acclimate into socializing Now once your mind slips into that gear of socializing on your way there。

 then you get into the venue itself and maybe right when you're near the door or in the line you might chat with people and then you're chatting with people and you're getting social then as you get into the venue itself you get deeper in the venue。

 you'll find that you're already so much in the flow of being social that is effortless just to start talking now the cool part is that when you start approaching random girls on the street or just people in general on the street frankly。

 whoever it is what you get instead of excuse making momentum is action takingking momentum and action takingking momentum is the momentum unto itself where basically what it does is two major changes in what's going on with you inside that manifest in how you'rehaving with the girls the first change is that you go from this kind of logical headspace to a kind of playful social head space because if you've been working all week and it's Friday night。

 you don't go out to continue to work。I'm continuing to work。

 you got to like change a part of your brain where it's almost like blowing off steam and blowing off steam means that you can kind of let go of this linear thinking and just get into like a silly fun thinking and you get into that silly fun thinking what's so great about it is that when you go home at the end of the night you feel recharged you feel refresh because let go of that intense part of your mind and you have some fun right so going out supposed to be a lot of fun and when you start talking to people on your way to the venue it means that you can start to get that kind of flow where you just your thoughts are just kind of playful and funny and wild and expansive rather than being so logical and so essentially what you're avoiding is walking in this quiet solitude on the way to the venue or just mumbling with your friends about what game you're gonna do when you get there in this logical headspace and then boom boom boom be playful like that you can kind of ease your way into it so basically just what we're teaching is open on the way of the venue so the idea being like almost everybody makes a million fucking reasons to not open on the way。

Right it's just it's an excuse out of excuse So warm up exactly that's exactly it But like everybody's different。

 I mean， there's people who maybe for them it would make more sense not to do this on the way there like they would find it distracting it varies on the person I've never said that the way that I do it works for everybody It's just what I found worse for me but funny enough I find it worse it seems to work for everybody you know yeah but there's some people who really like some people would really rather just go into the club because like dude。

 I I'm going the club I'm a cool guy I don't need like talk to people in the way of the club bro like I'm good to go the club like this whole thing is kind of retarded。

 I've gone out alone for many years So going out all by yourself。

 it's like you can it's so quick to descend into this garbage of not opening anybody all night out you got to warm up like warm said before you Yeah yeah。

 it's not an excuse to not open if you see a great girl。

 I haven't warmed up yet but it can be helpful So like even here like look at like okay。

Look at this like little group here。And again， it's like there's every excuse to not。

I like your shirt， by the way Oh thank you honey're welcome。Thanks。

 so there's every excuse in the world to not。Just open for a sec。 the excuses mount up。

 and yet what's the worst thing that can happen You truly make me the happiest person on。

Nothing they need0。That was a bad open just kind of weird， I kind of pointed at her while doing this。

 check this out。 This is what's so crazy。 What I did there。

 It res my brain what to not do because like。I'm ready， I'm ready to， you ready for this？あ。上玩。

like this my friends How did you Hey， do I permission。

 do I permission I know I'm weird I just like I'm innocent though really。

I actually appreciate you saying is this your number okay I'll call you later thank you by the way for letting me talk to your friend after I weird approach you thanks。

行。I'm going to show you the greatesttiest beard you ever see， you know that is quite a beard。

 that is quite a beard wow very nice。はいは。I have a boyfriend he's like right there oh hey boyfriend。

 thank you， hey， you got this， you got this。what the fuck that's an inspiration。

 but in addition to that I think this is like the real key。

And I say this is my my boy sounds like I hit puberty。

 but we' just been gaming so hard this week and it's been insaneEssential what happens is that。

Your reticular activation system， which is your selective focus。

 it actually makes a shift when you start doing this when you start taking action it's amazing。 okay。

's the most amazing field in the world and the shift that your reticular activation system， you know。

 look that up if you don't know what it is is your selective focus RS。

 what happens is that your AS shifts from finding every possible reason not to approach like when you see a grow。

Your eyes are actively looking like is she was someone where she going like you can see like in the person's eyes like you look at the girl and you start looking around for what can go wrong。

 It's just from this prevention orientation of what can go wrong to what can go right So as you're going to the venue itself whatll start to happen is your re you's like to focus We'll see the girl and it's just why can this work why is this fucking awesome why do I have to do this like right fucking now And so essentially by the time that you get to the venue the beauty of this is that as you've gone just sort of talking with people enjoying it you're not just being this little quiet guy that jumps out to games game time and then back down to your little troll cave but you're actually being that guy just chatting with people you're in nice social mood your particularler activation system is finding reasons to approach this great flow and you can just gradually ease your way in now for venue to venue。

 you keep that same kind of fun because you go to another venue。

 you don't want to be like all stuck up in your head again then trying to crack out of it you just ease your way through the entire experience。

 What we're seeing here do you see how that quickly escalates into a couple different。St okay。

 so already think how by going to the venue， what kind of mood are we in now。 Do you see Okay。

 so now they're trying to invite you into the bar So you see the transition here is just it easily transitions by the time that you get to the venue。

 Do you see how much easier it is to now go in the venue but you see how it built on the way over right to where now it now funny enough by stopping and talking about it。

 I'm actually making it like almost worse the continues right。

 we want that but it's good to to like break it down。 You know what I'm saying right night。快sure。

I saw you and I had to give you a hug， I know。Free hugs I am so fortunate thank you for that free hug free hug Thank you so much。

So。And it's just like， but by doing that， it's also like it puts me one step closer because I'm not just playing for whatever goes've seen here。

 I'm playing for that girl that is so intimidatingly hot that if if I think about it for even a millisecond。

 I'm gonna be like kind of off my center so I'm making it to where I've gone there now when I see that girl who's just like you know that Megan Fox looklike where I。

Like that， I'm like， I'm reflexibly going， yeah， so I'm putting myself in a position to win。

Rather than putting myself in a position to fail。はい。INope this is my'm from。

 he's living down here for a exactly the。Say something a about you like about grab and never do it quick。

 say something that you like。You have to give a reason that you like about it。

 You have to give her a reason。 There's a reason that you would call her。

 see what happened caught you there。 So those are fast numbers。

 Fast numbers you want to you got to do quaifier。 you can't be like well。

 we talk's like you want to give it can work if the vibe is just so there but what I like to do is I'll give I want to give exactly the vibe so there if the vibe is so there this the vibe is because the vibes not quite there with this girl but there's still something So if you can give a sharp on fucking point compliment of why you want to call her then it can add up in her head。

 I always find funny by the way， people guys and girls chatting like you're not allowed to talk you're allowed to go talk't rude you can talk people are free to talk to each other how do you know everybody。

Com two seconds， two seconds I want you to meet my friends they really cool quick Yeah quick。

 I so many that's my badside。It's my good side， Okay know what？It's okay。娃完了不水太。😊。

He got be late quite a few times。Man。I keep your eyes open all of my cast is in your pocket。

Gu you're like the man。O。I have some of my girlfriend there。You're very authoritative and Friday。

 I am very authoritative。I'm on living， good night， Good night。你是妹会有吗？

I'll leave you back here friends Ill leave you back your from in San Diego。 San Diego Carl。

 I live in Carl Yeah that's cool。 I went to San Diego State now I'm applying to master's programs。

 but currently I work as a substance abuse counselor substance abuse counselor for heroin addicts。

 It's amazing。 I'm very like the most antid you've ever seen your life。 I'd never drink at Iowa。

 Well， they do。 I know I know I've never either。 Well， I have had alcohol， but other than that。

 I've never done drugs， but they have's currently sober now。

I never have been addicted anything I right now， Yeah， me too。Yeah，s cool， yeah， no。

 I really have a good understanding。How it kind of functions and I'm a believer in going in the opposite direction so like I don't even put bad food in my body。

 I'm always like detoxing， cleansing and trying to fill my head， not even on television。

 I don't even on TV。So I just keep it clean， just ho up my business What's your business I do a cell development company。

 I run a cell development company That's not like I knew me。

 What does that mean self development I am a public speaker。So that's why I'm like into that stuff。

 but it's a pleasure to meet you a very beautiful woman Thank you very much Yeah have a good night okay。

This whole thing winds up becoming like this crazy wave and it just goes up and up and up and your whole night can be crazy like this。

 but I don't want you to pressure yourself and drive yourself crazy over it rather what I want you to do is just enjoy the experience for what it is and if you just want to walk to a venue and not do this don't feel like I'm saying that you have to I'm not saying that I'm just saying like I said the very start of this video that if you find value in it if you try it。

 you just test what I'm saying and if it has value to you then what I believe that you'll experience is an incredible benefit in your night with one little distinction and that is just making the choice to learn from your bad nights and realizing what caused them essentially logical thinking and you know excuse making momentum and shifting that from an early little changing your behavior just by opening girls all the way there。

 let me ask you guys this now that you're about to walking in here how much more normal does't seem to walk in here。

tyYeah way normal you see that so it it's not even really a change in vibe we've already done the work on the way there the only downsides of it makes us late for the club That's where you can hour that's yeah。

 yeah， what should we do as we enter the club？Process on the street， what happens？

🎼Will you continue it an open away。 It continues right And again。

 it's personal preference like you may prefer not to do this。 it depends。

 you have to notice yourself。 it's not like you have to do it this way， but you have to be selfaware。

 If you find that when you go in， you circle， you go to the bathroom， you wander， you make excuses。

 you start getting what I call excuse making momentum。 I do tons of I've done it for years， right。

 So excuse making momentum。 So what I'm gonna to do is like I'll see like take that Asian girl over there。

 I just walk over here。How are you really good。🎼Oh， you give a good hugs your friend。 Yeah。

 how are you guys doing He， how are you？😊，Bard's recent。Thats meet you。🎼What's your name。

Blealesssure to meet you to meet you too from there it's like if we work our way now。

 it's just that much more mental reinforcement that it's okay in a way if it goes bad。

 that's even that's you can argue it's even fucking better。You know。

 because it is just numbing you to anything， making you just be on your own pass。

 I'll just like pop in。What are you drinking？I will give you5。

I love you are you Italian Italian No where do you come from where do you come from I mean where I come from？

Wow， you're a Latina， that's cool。What's your name your name's Italian？Italia。Oh， that's beautiful。

UI am， but do you want to put me on a screen if you want to， give me you？

🎼How easy is that easiest thing in the fucking world， right， You just go talk to somebody。

 So many people relied on alcohol。 It's insane。 It's insane。 Okay， so there's no need to do that。

 Just loosen up by just be to engage。 then we we start to work our way in。 Okay。

 I'll move ahead of the group a little bit and just watch how I work my way in。 Okay。

 if I'm going really well in my game， maybe I don't need to do this。 But if I find that I'm。😡。

Having rough nights consecutively， I can bring this back as a habit Okay so I know I can denate off these rules。

 these sillyass not needing to really follow rules。

 but if I know I'm having a hard time for a couple nights in a row。

 I get back on it and then my results go back to normal So as we're walking in the ladder part now weve built it to where as the simulation ramps up right like as the simulations ramping up in the club。

 we're adapted to as we enter in the club， you see that okay so as soon as I go here。

 I'm going to maintain that even though it's more hectic in here。🎼因为因为。Now。哎呀。Nice to meet you。

🎼So the changes a little bit the energy shifts a little as we get here right Yeah I've got actually the dial a little bit on my pro as I'm coming in imagine doing all that from the start your very that's why I like to sort of ease into it going agains like like chaos in the cannon here compared out on the street isn't it so different just crack at it。

 you'll accimate to it as keep doing it。 you'll it but it'll take right my buddy Brand by the way。

🎼你す。🎼next me。美女。🎼我难。Amenia。🎼お that school。Yeah。G kid。Okay， try to come in with me later， okay。你们走。

I know I grew it as a joke for fun， but it's be kind of amazingmusing。好，谢谢的给。打得比较细。All，Hello， Miss。

 pleasure to meet you。H儿。What are you up to？I thought I was my friend。

Let me introduce you to my friends。Branon。How are you's been talking so much about you。I。

guys welcome， what gang is this？This is Eric。Have you ever kissed the grby board？为家自己。아기さ。我在ち。不用了给他。

I am incredibly passionate about this silly little idea of talking to people on my way to the venue and this comes from my years as an introvert and you know going out back in Canada as like a guy of my young 20s all by myself or you know even moving down to the LA and just being terrified to be approaching people and these hours that I spent just years of these hours that I wasted in my life just a walking to the venue in this completely isolated mindset and then that night going completely shit。

 just garbage night of me walking around not approaching anybody trying to work up the nerve to approach people and just the hours and hours that I wasted so I'm sitting here talking to you about this or when you see me coaching this live try to keep in mind that I'm passionate about it because I'm imagining your reality where I had a video that somebody said to me。

 hey dude， you're walking in this introspective state you're too logical just ease into your night talk to people in the way there now where this could go wrong is very simply that you think you have to do。

Look dude， sometimes you're gonna see me walking to a venue and I'm not approaching anybody。 Okay。

 you don't have to do this all the time。 What's cool about learning kind of rules in the game is that you can break those rules。

 you don't need to do them。 But then if you finally you have a couple bad nights in a row。

 you know what you can fall back on to get back on track。

 So a lot of time I'm not actually approaching people when I walk to the venue。

 But if I notice that I'm getting to the venue， I'm too stuck in my head I'm too introverted。

 I can bring that back in my future nights going out and probably get back on track up to。😡。

Don't don't try to go in theframe， you got to lead those don't go in there。

 don't be like what do you have to where you' going。

 lead them to where you'd be going you know what I mean right Hey。

 let's start walking this way Bob and just kissing me。Have a book， a good burger， I know I'm j。

 I'm I really j of what？You have a burger and I can't have a burger touch my teeth。

A we your favorite guys that you mentioned it？Of course。Yeah。

 see because why because we're fun it's true isn't I like fun she likes fun guys What's name What's your name how much more fun were we than every other guy you met tonight？

He wait how much more fun I need time Okay how much more fun were we than every other guy you talked to tonight how much more like1 why because theyre fun say that you know。

 that's right the guys are so really we're just they So most guys are boring they're unpredictable they're in their own heads。

If you know what that is I't no I don't know anywhere outside the state。

 I don't have a passport Oh Im just I'm I'm just like America and then I don't know where anything is Central America it's weird I don't go down there right underneath nope mean my geography on Do you work out geography see it in great shape。

itYou ever come to LA Yes I'm from LA really my sister are you guys going to coming hang out of this？

In LA way。Wherere you now？Right now I'm more minded， I meant like in the future。Oh。

 do you want to come to burger Lou right now？It's up that way want to join Okay。

 let's do it this was further than I thought it was it's like four blocks I don't know if you guys want to come that far which other's numbers because it's further than we thought we don't want to drag you heels that far Yeah we'll conduct LA anything Okay what is going。

Will you say like that like that， How could I say no and my number is 6，1，9 Enjoy your stay。

 I shouldt mean you。 Nice to meet you too。 Nice to meet you sweet。 Nice to meet you， honey Bny。

Goodbye， mature with。So what I want to do here is save hours of your life and it really is just with this one little tweak it's starting to approach people so that you can ease into the shift in stimulus you can ease into the shift of mindset and very importantly you start focusing on oh this is gonna go good instead of looking for every little excuse again with that part of this is gonna go good I want to see that shift in your eyes from you see the girl then you're like what's wrong what's wrong what's wrong what's wrong I can't do it。

 she's on her way she's the guy she's the girl excuse excuse excuse excuse and shifting that selective folks girl bang lock on and making it happen what you'll find when that happens is you'll see girls on the move and you'll like run him down you're like hey boom right in there and even if there's people around them when they're on the move they'll want to stop and talk and the friends will be okay with it so I'd love to see this shift in you I believe that if you make this shift and you allow yourself to kind of ride the crest of the increasing momentum of the night the increasing fun of the night the playfulness of the night and just talking to be making this fucking。

Free for all your night is gonna be so much fun， you're gonna be addicted to going out。

 you're gonna meet so many girls and you're gonna make so many friends with this way you're gonna find is an increase in confidence that carries you not just in your social life but in all the important success elements of your life in general so like I said。

 just from this one little tweak of making the choice that instead of going to the club and waiting to talk to people and making the excuses getting into excuse making moment but this one little tweak that you decide to actually talk to people on your way there。

 what you'll find is that from all these times that you've gone out and had bad nights。

 you've learned from it you've hyperid what triggers a bad night and then you really zoned in on what creates a good night and when you surrender to that process and you make the choice to do something right at 10 pm or earlier on your way there you make the choice of something good earlier you see that you planted a seed that pays off in high dividends later at the night I hope that this off the wall of vlog is passionate talking about talking to people on the way there has motivated you。

It inspired you to make a simple change。 and when you do， I know you're going to enjoy a lot。 Anyway。

 lots of more changes to come。 I'm actually going to be heading back to Los Angeles and crashing out very soon and I'll talk to you soon。

Peace。
