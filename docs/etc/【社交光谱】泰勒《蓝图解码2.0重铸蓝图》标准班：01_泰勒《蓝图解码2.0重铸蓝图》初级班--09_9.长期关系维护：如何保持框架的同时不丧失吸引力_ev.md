# 【社交光谱】泰勒《蓝图解码2.0重铸蓝图》标准班：01_泰勒《蓝图解码2.0重铸蓝图》初级班--09_9.长期关系维护：如何保持框架的同时不丧失吸引力_ev

🎼我是社交光谱莱特，那么我们继续来图解码2。0之旅。本次这节课泰勒讲了关于长期关系，讲了自己的过去，讲了前女友，讲了自己的情感史，讲了自己失恋的心态，还有无所畏惧的心态。

我感觉啊这是泰勒这么多年沉淀的一个结果，也是让我们了解到一个不一样大师顿悟之后对于一个情感的一个理解。So how do you feel right now？

As far as release and merg into it。Okay？So it's always hilarious for me to watch some aspirational YouTuber or social media influencer or speaker watching public speakers for me is just watching people that are so awkward。

 they don't know what they're doing and they're trying to do it from their control muscle So they're up in front of the crowd like hey guys。

 okay， So I'm expert。 Here's what we're going to learn today。 Oh right， this is gonna be super cool。

 know it's like the funest thing for me to watch。😡。

It's like watching people trying to de or socialize。

 it's just like watching this complete dumpster fire。妈。嗯。

Well the big we want to get really funny when I teach you what you're going to learn about marketing。

 you in the next few days， particularly Saturday， but in the next few days。

 you're gonna to see how most people are marketing and it's just like a face palm it is so bad watching people market particularly social media influencers wholl use PayPal or subscribe to our services like that and they just beg people to go to their subscribe start like or they're Paypal they're like okay guys to keep this going I just need you to give me a donation like really bro。

😡，ははは。A call to action should be yielding major dollars。

 a call to action shouldn't be begging like to keep this going guys， keep the seven going。

 I just need you to set in like 20 bucks a month。And then it's going to be okay。

 That's not a call to action。 That that's like， you know。

 if you're trying to get better at dating and you know。

 you walk up to someone who you're attracted to and you're like， look。Really lonelyly。

 it needs attention。To keep this going， you need to， you know， it's like， come on。

 You're not going to convince anybody with anything that way so。Yeah， so you know。

 so I'll show you how to trigger that desire， to trigger that movement and so on and so forth。

 It also comes down having something great to offer too。

 but I'm going to show you how to present that in a way that's going to be really taking the focus off yourself right when you're begging for a donation Who's it about you you've got to make it about the other person。

😡，When you're in your head， who's it about？😡，You when you're in your body， you're just sharing。

 and that's why people pay more attention， because why would people pay more attention to you freely expressing that you being in your head。

 if you think about it， What's so wrong with you speaking from your head， What's wrong with that。

 It's still the same communication。 Why is it such a big deal。 Why is one energetically compelling。

 and the other， there's sort of a wall that goes up to where you don't want to hear it。

 What's going on there， simpleim。😡，In human existence or in any animal life。

Every single biological entity is in effect， wanting to suck from the other biological entities。

 Look at a fish movie， right like blue Planet， go look at planet Earth。

 What are all the animals doing in the jungle。 They're consistently eating each other。😡。

You know the vegetation is getting energy out of the soil， out of the sun。

 then some animal comes and eats that。There's even animals that want to eat you。 There's， I mean。

 think about this。 There's viruses， little microscopic。

 little viruses and parasites and bacteria that are trying to overtake your body right now and kill you。

😡，You know the main reason we reproduce。 Do you even know。It's because。

Bad little entitiesities learn how to get into our bodies。

 So we need to keep reconstituting ourselves in your kid， your grandkid， your great grandkid。

 and on and on and on so that the little invaders don't learn how to get in your body it's like an arms race。

 It's this continual arms race。😡，That's there's literally microscopic things like on the chair right now that are trying to burrow its way in like into your hand。

 you scratch your nose。 now it's going into your nose and it's trying to multiply and replicate inside there。

 And other human beings are doing the same thing to you。 Now。

 something amazing is when you can find a win win。 Part of human evolution is that we can find winwins with each other。

 That's the really powerful thing。 right Like， say you come to an event like this。

My goal is to get energy from you in the form of payment。

 your goal is to get energy from me in the form of instruction or in the form of status。

 if you get to brag your friends that you came to the event，😡。

Because that's great marketing right there。 by the， if you could raise the perceived status of it。

 that's very powerful。 So a win win is where I could get paid。

 and then you can go and get an Ri in this。 My goal。

 the entire time I'm teaching you is I've got to get you an R Oi to where you make more money so that when you make more money。

 you'll take my next event。I got to get it where you're like， man。

 after I took that my income shut up， so now I want to go to get more income。

 right that's called a win win。😡，say that you have a mom and your kids or dad of your kids and you create new life together。

 and that brings you a lot of joy and enjoyment and it creates the next generation。 that's a win win。

 so we can be in a win win。 but at the same time， there's also all this coming at you that's a win lose。

😡，Funny side note that I'll mention to you。In my dating life， as I've gotten older。

 one thing I've gotten to be really good at is just to let in the good energy and to completely filter any bad energy from anyone I'm dating。

 It's the crazy if you watch it， it's actually comedic to watch because whatever I'm dating somebody I understand that they're gonna give me good energy in the form of physical intimacy they're gonna give me good energy in the forms of emotional fulfillment in terms of joy joking around having fun。

 but I also know they're probably going to unload their drama on me right Am I right or am I wrong and also be admitted。

 you've also unloaded your drama onto other people And if you're gonna say no。

 then that means that you're the worst offender It's always always like I've never done that that means that person's the worst I to talk to someone like if youve ever given drama to your act they're like never I'm like keep away from me then because I know you're completely delusional and denial。

 which means you're probably worse at it so。😡，Literally I'll be hanging out with somebody and then all of a sudden they'll start getting into some kind of ranch or Diribe about something negative or something they're trying to get from me or things like that。

 and you'll literally see no change in my demeanor at all， and I don't even answer the questions。

 I don't even hear it。😡，You wonder why it's kind of funny？

I've just had so many different people have data in my life who turn that way， and it goes sideways。

 And then you spend all this time emotionally investing into somebody。

 kind of building synergy with them and getting to know them and putting time in it。

 And then at the end of that， it ends。 And what do you have left。😡，Literally， you're just like。

And then it's over。 There's nothing that came from it。 So from that， I said to myself。

 what did I get from all the different relationships that I've had。

I think it's very spiritually uplifting。 I think， you know relating to someone else on that higher level when you're seeing each other is very spiritually uplifting。

 So then I ask myself， well， I'm going to continue to see new people at different points of my life。

😡，How do I make sure that it's very uplifting and I don't leave from it kind of burned。

 And what I do is I just don't take on their baggage。😡。

When you watch somebody try to give me baggage， someone I'm seeing。

 it's like watching an expert tap dancer， tap dance around it。 I do it unconsciously。😡，Like you know。

 they hug me， kiss me， we hook up， I'm like taking it all in， enjoying it， having fun。

 then they bring drama， and I'm like，And then I just keep it moving like it it's like a slippery eel。

 You can't get it。 You can't get me。 it's hysterical to watch。

 sometimes like I'm almost like watching it because I don't do it on purpose。

 It's not intentional at this point。 Ive just learned like when somebody's feeding you drama。

 What are they trying to do They're trying to load you up with negativity and they're trying to take that negativity out of themselves and put it on you So what I've learned is just don't even indulge because funny question ask when you have indulge with your partner's negativity。

 Did it really bring you closer。 No， they just realize now they can do that to you。

 You're just the person that they can do that to now。 you're the person without a boundary。

 you're losing your halo effect。 They're not worried about like they know they can just throw their crap at you and you don't care So I always want to keep the person I'm dating excited about me。

 I want to keep it where they value me。 So I want them to understand there's a clear boundary here。

 The good gets in the bad there's a wall you can't get me I could read you I mean。

 I'm gonna to do it， but I could read you so many text I'm never gonna to do this but I could read you so many text messages from girls that try to get in my head and。

😡，Just say all this weird， nasty stuff to me。And you would be shocked because honestly。

 if they go over a boundary， I'll just politely say， hey， you know that's past the boundary。

 but I hope that you feel better and I hope you're doing awesome and they're making some kind of demand for like more time or more this or more that and then they may not call back for a couple days。

 you know why do they not call back for a couple days， it's a tactic， what are they doing to you？😡。

They're trying to they're testing， but what else are they doing。

 They're trying to just get you to get all negative and panic。 I don't panic。 I keep my cool。

 I'll do that。 They'll look at my Instagram story。 And I'm just out with my friends like like completely indifferent。

 And they're shocked about that。 They're like why didn't it work。

 I've manipulated all these other guys and you know got them all upset。

 This guy just doesn't care when I see them。 I'm like babe， let me tell you something。

 I think you're amazing， I love you to death。 You will never get under my skin。 Keep trying。

 I'm just gonna out phone you。 You can get all crazy。 but then I say them I go。

 but you know what else。 I'm not gonna dump you for this either。

 So feel free to act like this all you want。 I'm not gonna dump you because it doesn't affect me So on the good side。

 I'm not gonna dump you。😡，But on the downside， I'm also not gonna be affected。

 And once they've gone through four or five episodes like that。

 and they just say you're so consistent。 they just fall head over heels in love with you because they value you more now。

 and you're getting more out of it。 I completely have faith that if someone leaves me。

 I will just meet somebody else。 I'm happy to continue with that person。

 Ill always my biggest thing I do in relationship is I always want to value the person the same as I did when I first met them。

 And I'll tell you why I've seen so many people do this to me where either someone I'm dating or someone I'm working with。

 They're first working with me。 They're so excited。 I've got to do assistant here。😡。

These guys beside himself， he's literally like。Like freaking out to be assisting it's so funny for me to watch him。

 right I can't see he's back there right now， but he's literally like freaking out he's losing his mind。

Is he back there？ Okay all right， I should almost bring him up here to see how excited he looks right And I'm watching this。

 And to me， it's like watching a cartoon because I understand how that's how a new team member starts and then slowly but surely they just kind of go to the more down to the mean to the default So I know that when I'm first meeting somebody that that way they are at first is not the way they're gonna stay at first what they're doing is they're giving their best。

 Why is that because they want they want to bait you to sort of merge with them they want to make it where you're invested and What happens is you get so much good emotions from that other person。

 what do you start doing。😡，You start to get invested in them and even lead on them for good emotions。

 right What I can do is I can keep a baseline positive emotion at this point in my life where I'm very happy。

 And then if someone wants to give me added emotion， I'm just like， yay。

 But then if but then if they go to take it away， my baseline is strong enough ands stable enough that it's really not a big deal And because I so enjoy going to meet new people。

 I'm like oh the movie ended。 what's the next movie。😡，And by the way， a lot of people。

 when they think of their x's， they're so salty， right they're like， oh。

 I hate Deb which ultimately means that they still want them。😡，I'm not even like that。

 If you ask me about N X， ask me any X， oh， she's amazing。 She's the best。Well。

 if you think that highly ever， why aren't you with her， you know？Just a great time。

 And I don't think any deeper about it。 I just， I remember how good it was。 I have no bitterness。

 no saltiness。Which by the way， not to be like sound nasty， but in like a creepy way。

 that's like the ultimate when not to be nasty， it's like almost like the ultimate revenge。😡。

How frustrating is it when you see your act just completely wtting， totally indifferent。

 and they like， you're amazing。😡，Keep winning， you know right and but I'm not doing it to be mean。

 It's real。 Like I if I saw one of my ex'es winning right now or getting married to some other guy。

 I'd probably be in tears happy for them。 I'd be like， wow， that's amazing。 That's so great。

 Now all know that that X is like giving hell to that guy behind the scenes。

 right Like I know like you can't trick me bro。 I've seen I know this movie。😡，Okay。

 I'm not fooled by the Instagram。 I know what's behind that Instagram， but， you know。

 I know what's behind door number one。 So you can pretend you guys are like BFF forever。

 but I know what's behind there， but。But like I learned to just take the good。

And be happy in my baseline， enjoy it。 But if somebody gets out of my skin。

 I'll hear them out because I could be wrong， right， we could always be wrong。

 So if somebody has something to say to me， like， you know， you could do this better and that better。

 I'll definitely pause and hear them out。 I'll take a day or two to reflect on it and think about it。

 But if I can see that they're just trying to play a game， I don't get pulled in。 last point on this。

 Why is it that human beings do this to each other。 By the way， very sad statistic。

 My understand I could be wrong。 I that the majority of calls to the police is from what。

Domestic violence。What is the main way that people's negativity？😡。

Or low vibration energy manifests from the depths of hell into the world。😡，Their partner。

Why is it they do it with their partner because the boundary is down。The boundary is down。So。

If you study things like borderline personality disorder。The BPP， the person。

 the borderline personality， will always show the disease of the mind on a close family member。

 an intimate partner， a father， a son， the negative energy is in any personality disorder。

 BP do you should look that up， if you ever had a partner that's super crazy， look it up。

If you're super crazy， also look it up。 But part of the thing with BPD is that people BPD don't know they have it。

 So you're screwed。 So I'm just kidding。 So you have。So what happens is。You。

The BPp will put that energy out on the partner because there's no boundary。

 So I've learned over time。I don't want to have no boundary because see。

 we think of love as this ultimate dissolution to boundaries。 But where does most love end up。

 Most love ends up in arguments， fighting， saltiness， divorce， bitterness， or even in domestic abuse。

😡，I mean， for most of you in this room， hopefully you've never been in a domestic abuse situation。

 but I bet you that most of you have probably been close。😡，Great， yeah。

 but you know like how many of you， for example， have had it where maybe your partner starts screaming so much in your face。

 they're antagonizing you to go over the edge and then you're like。

 well I'm get out of here and then they may even block the door they'll block the door because they want to antagonize you to the point of you cracking best less in the world to anybody in that situation。

 get out of there whatever cover your hand so that you can't even like like even if you grab to move them。

 that could make a mark， you're done for you're over so you can't even do that。

 you've got to just like。😡，Be like。just get out of there。 Okay， and by the way。

 if someone's pushing you that point， cut it loose because that means they can push you that point again and believe me。

 if you go over the line， even though they push you there， it'll be you at fault。

 So somebody's antagonizing you simply cut them out of your life forever， forever。😡。

Because they're pushing you to something that is going to ruin your life， Never， never hit a woman。

 never， if you're a woman， hit a man， never hit anybody。 period， you do that。

 You are in so much trouble， your life will change forever。

 So if you're seeing that it's getting pushed to that point， it's done now。😡，From there。

Understand the lack of boundary， what that does， and learn to keep your boundary let in the good。

But don't let in the bad。 And then what you do is you look for win wins。 Okay。

 you look to establish a win， win。For example， in your dating life， it could be casual。

 it could be open， It could be exclusive， It could be a lifelong thing。

 It could be a couple month thing。 I've had incredible relationships that were completely open。

 where we use condoms。And maybe every Thursday， we go do something really fun。 We go hang out。

 We joke around。 Yeah， we'll hook up。 But that's the least of it。

 Like that's the least of what I'm getting out of it。

 I've had other open relationships where they just come over at one of the morning。

 because that's what they want to do every Wednesday。 They just show up。

 And that's all they really want for me。 They view me as a sausage with feet。

 And I'm completely fine with that。 And we actually have fun doing that。

 Some of my best relationships have been like that， I'm busy and the girls super busy。

 They're crazy busy and they just want somebody to have physical contact with while they can kind of proceed in their lives。

 I've also had great monogamous relationships where're best friends， We go do things together。

 We have fun together。 and that's nice because you don't have to use a condom。

 You can have great sex with condom， but you can have even greater sex without。

 So but you can still have great sex with condom。 I enjoy condoms because。

I feel like you're being safe。 I like being safe。 I like it。

 The worst film in the world is you hook up with someone you don't know and you didn't use a condo。

 And right after you finish， you're like， what was I think it's the， it's like。

 it feels good in the moment feels really good。 But then after it's the worst feeling youve ever had。

 So I like condos。 But it's also nice to be seeing somebody where you don't have to use them。

 And maybe you can explore your sensuality to a higher degree， right。

 So it's like all of it's like really good， really， really good。

 But I've had many different great relationships。 And what I've learned over time is。😊。

If I see that that relationship has turned。Bible cut it loose。Now I'll take the feedback。

 I'll listen， and I'll cut it loose。😡，So。Back in the day， here's what would happen。

 Id start off a relationship。 The first3 to 6 months， amazing，10 out of 10。

 I would completely open up， and then we'd have our first argument。 No big deal。

 It's just an argument。 Who cares。 I'm， I'm not like overly。 I'm tied about that。

 I'm totally chill about that。Then it's good for another couple of weeks， that another argument。😡。

Then the argument goes from maybe once a month to maybe twice a month to maybe three times a month。

 four times a month。Every other day now， to me， when the dynamic has soured is when you can't be just together at enjoying the energy。

😡，And what you'll see is when you talk to them， they're trying to frame control you into giving them energy。

 so they're trying to put little boundaries up well， who are you talking to。

 what's this person doing， what's in your phone， Are you going spend more time with me are you going to do this that's not okay Hey you said that and it gets have have all of us here in this room had it where a relationship goes from flood into a weird power struggle ongoing where every little bit of communication is just someone trying to make their point。

 show someone that point of view and so on and so forth So I remember。😡。

I had a number of relationships that would eventually go to that point。 So as I got older。

 I remember I have an example I've taught of this。 It was the first time I had the breakthrough。

 I met this girl。 such a great girl。 we'd always have fun。

 The story I've told about this is like I don't know I always have different things I'll do a different girls I'd hang out with So I had this new crib has like a steam room bath and at the end of the day we would just go throw on like sub chill out music throw like an E sea salt pink lamp or a Himalayan pink sea salt lamp the steam room movie going we'd be in the tub。

 we throw coconut oil we'd have sex in the tub great it's like super chilled out livebe end of the day it's awesome man。

 know very striking girl， you know giving me all this attention and my favorite part wasn't the sex even though that's the climax so to speak but for me my favorite part was the joking around It was the fact that we're on each other's team We care for each other。

 We're invested in each other and talk about fun adventures that we want to have you're sharing your life with somebody and you。

Have adventurevents together。 You don't live forever， right， You got to make it fun。

 So that was my favorite part。 you know， if we weren't having sex。

 I would have hated that because that's just kind of like。😊，A creepy like you know。

 you're naked in a tub with somebody， but you don't ever have sex and you're kind of hoy。

 Like that would be kind of weird。 But that so even though I want that that wasn't what it was all about for me。

 I want that， but it's not what it was all about。 was that I could hang out with her and it was energizing。

 It was that great energy that you're feeling not what you're just having sex。

 because that's what paradigm most of us are inre in a taker energy and then we're just trying to get sex like when I'm talking you here。

 I want to give you energy， I want you to have fun。 and I want you to give me back energy。

 and for us to be having fun together。 So you walk out of here tonight and you're like， wow。

 that was amazing。 I walk out。 I'm like that was amazing。 It was mutually energizing。 It's a win win。

 That's where real synergy happens。 I love that about human beings that we can have that And sharing your life with somebody else is so much more fun like I've got this big fat crib back in La。

 And I literally put another house near it where a bunch of my staff can say in bunk beds specifically because I like sharing that house with people。

😡，It's fun out have someone to share your life。 but let me tell you。

 imagine being in this big room here all by yourself。You know， maybe this was like the TV back here。

 that's the TV back there， right， and you're like。Hello。Hello。Big， big movie。Oh， for me， right。

 like when I'm a alone in my house， which is not that common， but if I I'm like。Hello， Mr。 Ha。

Just me you。 That's not cool。 right， I don't want to go to some super nice restaurant by myself。

 I can。 I can enjoy it。 I'll go to a movie by myself。 I do stuff like that。

 I'll go on a hike by myself。 But what I think makes it fun is going with somebody else。

 It's like a shared meaning。 We're human beings。 we're synergistic。 That's part of our biology。

 Some people are such load wolves that they're not like that。 That's really cool， too。

 But I think a lot of us are like that。 So it's nice to have somebody to share it with。

 The problem is， is that we want somebody to share it with。😊。

And you know a lot of the time guys will get this rep as being like all about sex， all about sex。

 I think men and women just want somebody to share their time with and to feel energized with。

 And it's like this weird like false dichotomy like this false dynamic that guys are all horny and like girls aren't or whatever I think everybody generally wants the same thing It's just that society sort of judges it a little bit differently and for that reason people can act differently。

 but I think we all are human， we want the same things。

 So what I've learned is that I will start looking at my relationships from a synergistic standpoint of what am I getting out of this what am I getting in this relationship in the sense of am I giving am I giving to someone who is receiving。

😡，They're receiving me well。 And am I receiving them well and regaining from this。

 What I learned was this inter a relationship。In the past， here's what I do， I'd get in it。

And I'd enjoy it。And it'd be good for a few months， a little fight， Good for a week or two。

 another little fight until the dynamic eroded to a power struggle。 Now， at this point。

 here's what's happening。If we're still having physical intimacy。That part's good。 frankly。

 when you're mad at each other， that can be even better。 I hate to say it， but it's true， right？😡。

It's still super hot， and I'm addicted on the intimacy and the physical contact。😡，But。

What's happening is I'm being depleted by the personality and the dynamic。😡。

So I'm being depleted by the dynamic， I'm being fed by the physical side。

And now what's happening is because I'm depleted energetically。😡，What do I have left at this point。

 only one thing， what's left？The physical。So now I need them。

To even function because I've been lowered energetically and depleted by the toxic dynamic。😡。

But I need the physical side in order for me to feel normal。 Then when you break up。

 not only have you been depleted， but you even lost the physical side。And now you're a wreck。

 So ironically， the same person's depleting you， you begin to crave them。

That's why human beings do this。 We do it unconsciously。 Why。 So the other person can't。

So the other person can't。You ever had this on you？Bigger question。

 more important question do you ever done to somebody else。You might have not known you're doing it。

😡，I had to recognize that in myself， some of my relations from my early 30s。 I was like。

That's what I'm doing， I could see I was doing that。And I was really sad about it。

 so I took real action to make sure that I don't bring my drama to other people。Ironically。

 for a lot of people when you date them， their version of real intimacy is the fighting is what you're like。

 we're going to deplete each other， so neither can leave。😡，Very bad。

So part of what we're going to do this weekend， this is to get you thinking about it。

Between now and Saturday。I want you to be thinking about the different relationships you have in your life。

 business wise， friendship wise， dating， love and romance wise。

And I want you to rate what you're getting from it。And what it's taking。

 so that's going to be part of your homework。🎼一段关系呢都包含着能量交换的一个过程。伴侣之间呢会给予彼此的欢乐、满足、快乐等正面能量。

但同时呢也可能向对方倾倒这种负面的情绪，通过有意识的去过滤掉伴侣的负面情绪，不让自己被他们所影响和困扰。当我们一味的迎合和承接对方的负面情绪的时候呢，并没有真正的拉近彼此的关系。

反而可能纵容了对方的情绪的倾倒，失去了自己在对方心中的特别的地位，那一段亲密关系的意义究竟是什么？如果只是不断的接收对方和处理对方的负面情绪。那这段关系未免显得太过于消耗和疲惫了。

在更高层次上的链接和共振，这才是让人兴奋和向往着。我们要学会不迎合，不承担对方的情绪包袱。当伴侣开始抱怨发牢骚的时候，或试图从你这里索取什么的时候，你要学会置之不理，就像他说的像一条滑不溜秋的鱼一样。

这些负能量无法附诸在你身上，不迎合，并不意味着冷漠或者是不关心对方。如果一味的付出迁就到头来啊，你可能一无所获。所以说真正的爱啊并不是无条件的接纳和承担，而是要学会在给予的同时也保护好自己的边界和能量。

那么一个人的能量的上限呢是关键关系的沉积。在感情里啊能够进入长期关系的，其实都是应该是互为关键关系的，彼此之间创造增量，而并不是依附关系，我们要去学会创造增量，去合作共赢。阿尔法男人的底层策略呢。

就是合作共赢，创造增量和价值。我们在恋爱关系中呢，一定要维护好自己的边界，保持自己的独立性啊和吸引力。很多人之所以在感情中呢从于劣势，就是因为过度的在意对方的态度，演变成一种低质量的情感博弈。

在关系中设定清晰的边界，非常重要，更愿意接纳对方的好的一面，比如兴奋啊、爱慕啊、欣赏等等，但坚决抵制任何越界的负面的一个投射。当约会对象啊尝试用一些消耗你能量的话或者是。进入你的心理的空间的时候。

我们要礼貌但坚定的指出这种行为的不恰当性，同时表达我们自己的善意和关心啊。泰勒呢用自己和约会对下互动的一个例子，生动形象的展示了如何巧妙的应对对方的情绪操控以及各种废物测试。

同时也保持自己的心理的平衡和主动权。那么如果说你也遇到了可能是情感操控或者是肺测的废物测试的例子，欢迎往我们社交光谱的读书会里面进行投稿。咱们会员会抽取精华部分去帮你去解读答疑解惑。很多时候啊。

有些女人用失联的方式来测试我们的反应。他们想看一看啊，就是当他们突然跟你断绝联系时，冷淡你的时候，你是否会陷入恐慌和负面的情绪。但如果你选择保持冷静自若，继续过自己的生活，该干嘛干嘛，对吧？

享受和朋友之间的社交，你就完全不会被对方的小把戏，所困惑。不要因为对方的任性或者不成熟，就去轻易的方弃这段关系。相反你可以用一种温和，不带批评。的方式让对方意识到自己的行为对你并没有所受影响。

这种宽容和自信呢，往往会让对方去更加珍惜这段关系。其实我们发现啊泰勒他对每段感情都是带着珍惜和感恩的之心的。无论感情是否长久，他都会全心全意的去对享受和对方相处的美好的时光，即使是分手了。

他也不会怀有怨恨或者苦涩，而是真诚的祝福对方祝福啊，不是说出于刻薄或者抱复，而是发自内心的一种真诚。你明白啊每段感情呢并不是一场征服和占友，而是一次灵魂的交融和成长，离开的人呢带走的是你的祝福。

可能留下的就是一些美好的回忆。我们要去享受结识新朋友的过程。在亲密关系中呢，当个人的边界消失，他会出现什么情况呢，就是负面的情绪和伤害的行为就会泛滥，甚至可能会演变成家庭暴力或者是吵架。在亲密关系中啊。

当我们面对这种逼迫和刺激的时候，一定要果断的说不，坚持的维护好自己的一个底线。如果对。还在不断的挑战你的界限，伤害你的尊严，那就应该彻底的了断这段关系。因为这已经是一种病态的或者是一种有害的相处模式了。

在这种情况下，离开并不是说脆弱或者不负责任，而是保护自己，拯救自己。那一段健康的快乐的亲密关系应该有的样子是什么呢？在这段关系中啊，我们双方不仅仅要享受肉体的亲密和欢愉。

更重要的是精神和情感上建立了真正的连接，双方都彼此关心，分享自己的生活，或者一起创造美好的回忆。其实这段关系反而让双方都感到充实，满足和精力充沛。泰勒过去的一些恋爱经历啊，说明了那些关系。

虽然一开始啊也很美好，但慢慢的变成了一种相互去掏空彼此的状态。吵架啊，权力斗争啊，情绪操控啊，这都会让双方都感到疲惫和受伤，而肉体的亲密呢虽然能够带来短暂的欢愉，但是往往无法弥补内心的创伤和空虚。

最终这样的关系往往以一方或者双方崩溃而告终。其实泰勒也深刻的剖析。这种病态的关系的一个根源，就是他指出啊很多人在潜意识里啊就会用争吵和伤害的方式来帮助对方，让对方无法离开。

这其实是一种极度缺乏安全感和自我价值的一个表现。当一个人无法相信自己值得被爱，无法相信对方会真心的爱自己的时候，他们就会用这种扭曲的方式来确认和维系这份感情。但这样的关系啊，只会带来无尽的痛苦和伤害。

他耗尽了双方的心力，摧毁了彼此的尊严和信任，即使有肉体的亲密作为慰藉，但真的没有办法去填补内心的创伤和空洞，久而久之啊，双方都会失去爱的能力，变得麻木，变得绝望，变得怨恨。这就是我们所说的爱无能。

泰勒又开始反思什么是一段健康的一个关系啊，真正的亲密关系就是不应该去消耗和控制，就是要去学会创造共赢，而不是通过伤害来绑定对方真正的亲密关系应该是建立在相互欣赏，彼此成就的基础上，在这样的关系中。

双方都能够感觉到被需要被重视，都能成。对方的身上呢摄取到正面的能量，这种能量不仅仅是肉体结合的这种默契，更来自于心灵的交流和滋养啊。很多人他争吵、控制、掏空，可能这就是他们所理解的亲密。

他们把伤害和爱划上等号，把摧毁当成战有的证明。每个人在本质上呢都渴望与他人去分享神秘，去分享生活。无论说是住在大房子里还是一起出去冒险，人都需要这种链接和共鸣，我们都渴望与他人分享体验。

这就是人性的一个美好的一表现。但是我们首先要成为一个自足和自爱的人，我们要学会从内心创造快乐和满足，而不是一味的从外界去索取。接下来我们会跟泰勒带大家一起探讨，如何去维护个人的边界。

同时在关系中呢保持独立的吸引性。亲密关系中，更重要的是创造增量，实现合作共赢，以及如何通过练习，运用不同的语音语调来提升我们的影响力。那么如果你现在已经在一段关系了。🎼但是呢也遇到了上面类似的问题。

可以在我们的研讨会社群里面一起聊一聊。对于兄弟们经常碰到的共性问题，我也打算在里面做出直播精讲，还是老样子更新的内容和消息，请留意咱们的公众号，社交光谱。好，那我们下一期。
