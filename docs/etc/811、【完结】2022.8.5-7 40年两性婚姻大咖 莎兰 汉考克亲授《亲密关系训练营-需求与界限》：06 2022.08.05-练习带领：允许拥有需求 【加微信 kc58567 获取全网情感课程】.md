I want everybody to just sit quietly for a moment and。

Just take in some of the things we've spoken about。那请大家静默的坐一会儿去感受一下我们刚才说过的一切。

And just take a deep breath。😔，深呼吸。😔，And I want you to think about the times when you've been in a relationship and you've had needs。

😔，去回忆这样的一个时刻，你在一段亲密关系里，你感受到了自己的需求。And you didn't know how to talk about those needs。你不知道如何去表达这份需求。

And how difficult it is sometimes to know what needs can you talk about and what needs are too big。

 too much。你很难去分得清哪一些需求是不切实际的，哪一些需求应该表达出来。So taking a deep breath just tell yourself it okay深呼系个始。

让我们首先把疗愈带给内在的这个孩童，让他感觉到我有需求是非常自然的。That's where we start building our self love as you say to yourself。

 I have needs。我们就从这里建立对自己的爱，我可以有需求。And it's okay for me to have needs。拥有需求非常自然。

Well let's just start with that ideal know need。I have needs， and it'sO that I have needs。就从这里开始。

我有需求，我有需求，非常自然。And some of those needs that are very。

How do we say important needs that needs that we're allowed to have， I need love。I need acceptance。

有一些需求非常的重要，比如说爱与接纳。I need space。To talk about things。比如表达自己的空间。

And just keep taking a breath and telling yourself it's okay to have needs。

 I'm allowed to have needs。持续的跟随呼吸自然的流淌，然后重复的告诉自己，我拥有需求非常自然，我可以允许自己所有的需求。

So you don't have to feel ashamed about having needs needs are natural这样你就不会对自己的需求感觉到耻辱，需求是自然的。

Take another deep breath。再来一轮深呼吸。Okay。And gently just。😊，Touch your body as if you say to your body。

 it's okay to have needs。 It's really I am allowed to have my needs。 That's important。然你可以轻柔的触碰自己的身体。

就好像对自己说，我可以拥有需求，拥有需求太自然了。And take another deep breath。再来一轮深呼吸。And now we have to expand our reality。

 which is I'm allowed to have needs and my partner is also allowed to have needs。

 we both have needs see that's already going into the adult。那现在呢我们要去扩展自己所看到的这个现实，我允许自己拥有需求。

那么我的伴侣有他的需求也再自然不过，这样就已经是一个非常对等的成年人之间的对话了。Oh so you could feel like if it's only I have needs。

 but I don't care about my partner's needs， then I'm a child looking for a parent see that's that's how you define it if only my needs are important but my partner's needs are not important then I'm a child。

这个时候你可以去感受一下，如果我仅仅允许自己的需求，不允许伴侣的需求，如果仅仅是自己的需求重要，伴侣的需求不重要，我们仍然是一个在寻找父母的孩子。

So I would like you to sit just in yourself and just visualize or imagine that a partner sits in front of you。

 you just visualize it， just imagine it。我邀请大家坐在这里去观赏，伴侣就坐在你的对面。So you imagine that that。

If you have no partner。Just imagine the partner you would like to have。如果你没有伴侣的话。

你可以观赏一个你理想中的伴侣坐在你的对面。We just do a little exercise， imagine that you bow to your partner。

 you just greet your partner with a bow so let's just bow to the partner好去想象你用一个致敬再向他啊做做这样的一个敬礼啊向他鞠一个小躬向你的伴侣致敬。

And you say。I respect my needs，然后对他说，I respect my needs，我尊重自己的需求， but I respect your needs。Also。

我也尊重你的需求。😔，This is being an edit。My needs are important。我的需求很重要。😔，And your needs are also important。

你的需求也很重要。😔，And I would like to tell you my needs。我想跟你聊聊我的需求。 please。

 can you give me a safe space to tell you my needs。请你给我提供一个安全的空间，让我向你倾诉自己的需求。

And I would like to hear your needs， I'm really interested also in what you need。我也同样想聆听你的需求。

我对你的需求很感兴趣。And together。Let us see what's possible。然后让我们一起看看有哪一些新的可能性。And feel how。

How good that feels to respect yourself。去感受一下，respect your partner。去感受一下，当你能够给到自己这样的尊重，也尊重伴侣的时候。

感觉多么的美妙。 and then we do this movement from the heart。让我们从 from you让我们从。I take from you让我们重新来做这个联系啊。

我从你那里。H and you bring the partner's energy to your heart。你把你伴侣的能量带到你的心中，我从那里得到了。And I give to you。

我也把它给你。And I take from you。我从你那里得到的。And I give to you。我给予你的。😔，That's what we're looking for。

 My needs and your needs这个是我们想要去做到的，也就是我的需求，你的需求都能够被照料。And just feel the feeling。 There's something。

About that， That is very。Grounding， it's very relaxing。去感受啊这样的一种交互，非常的能够让我们扎根踏实放松。

Because when we do that。We respect the needs and we respect the boundaries。当我们能这样做的时候，我们既尊重了需求。

也尊重了界限。It's not about。My expectations are so big and you have to give me everything because that keeps it。

😔，Stressful。这个时候。就不是说我们的需求很大，期待很大，你需要满足我的所有期待，这样的话会非常的压力，会非非常的有压力。

And then it goes further I know that there will be days when you are too busy to give me something and I am too busy to give you something。

 but we will find the balance。那我们再接下去深入啊，我们会在心中默念。我知道有的时候我太过忙碌，无法去满足你的需求，你也同样满足我我的需求。但我们会持续的寻找这样的平衡。

And it's very important to know that love succeeds when there's a balance of giving and receiving。

而我们会知道，一份真正的爱，若能要若能被建立起来，就需要施与受的平衡，就是给予与接受的平衡。
