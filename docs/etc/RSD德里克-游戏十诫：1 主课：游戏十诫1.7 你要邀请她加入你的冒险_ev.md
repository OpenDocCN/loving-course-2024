üéºCommandment 7Ôºå Thou shalt invite her to join your adventure„ÄÇ

What will happen if this commandment is disobeyedÔºüShe won't have a robust enough experience with you to feel excited and comfortable enough to have sex with you„ÄÇ

Or she won't stay long term because she knows she'll find a better option„ÄÇPepending on the context„ÄÇ

 she will think you either don't like herÔºå that you're a loser or that you're a pussy„ÄÇ

She wanted to pussyÔºå she would just become a lesbian„ÄÇShe doesn't need you„ÄÇCommandment explained„ÄÇ

Women universally want to be with men that other men admire and other women desire„ÄÇ

If you builds the kind of life you're enthusiastic aboutÔºå excited to wake up and live every day„ÄÇ

 it'll be much easier for a woman to want to come along for that fun and adventure„ÄÇ

If you're not even excited about your own lifeÔºå don't be surprised when women aren't either there„ÄÇ

In an ideal worldÔºå observing your life should make the following facts clear to the woman„ÄÇ

You are a quality man„ÄÇYou're respected by other quality men„ÄÇIf she wasn't spending time with you„ÄÇ

 another beautiful woman would be delighted to take her place„ÄÇHer friends are jealous of her„ÄÇ

 they wish they found their equivalent of a guy like Hugh„ÄÇ

Her friends may well try to fuck or date you„ÄÇIf you weren't together„ÄÇOr even if you are„ÄÇ

It doesn't matter if your goal is to be a skateboarder or a tech billionaire„ÄÇ

You'll find a great woman who is excited to be with you so long as you're accepting of who you are and you're on your path to being an even better version of yourself of great importance to women with options however„ÄÇ

 is that you really are the person you present yourself to be„ÄÇWhen she sees you having fun„ÄÇ

 being be respected and being emotionally stable across environments„ÄÇ

She feels confident about who you are„ÄÇ This is called congruence„ÄÇ

You'll likely to be less judgmental if you behave differently at work„ÄÇ

 because in this context you're involved in an obvious transactional relationship„ÄÇ

Where you're being paid to adhere to the norms of a different culture„ÄÇ

If you act substantially different in non work related environmentsÔºå however„ÄÇ

 like in front of her friends or family or your friends and family„ÄÇDon't be surprisedÔºå of course„ÄÇ

 if she does judge you for that„ÄÇIt's perhaps no better indicator to her of her ability to trust you than this subtle information„ÄÇ

When she sees you lying to people that you're close withÔºå she knows you lie to her as well„ÄÇ

WShe sees you behaving consistently in cross environments„ÄÇ

 especially when she knows you're tolerating a lot of social pressure that a normal man wouldn't be able to handle in that particular context or environment„ÄÇ

She knows you're the man you present yourself to be„ÄÇShe feels safe with you„ÄÇ

 she feels she can trust you„ÄÇShe feels like you're a man with core values and real integrity through the type of guy that's signed your path„ÄÇ

You're not compromising about who you are or what you want„ÄÇIn brief„ÄÇ

 she thinks you're a fucking champ„ÄÇThe same phenomenon holds true with through other relationships as well„ÄÇ

When your're friends or people in business relationships with you„ÄÇ

 seeing you a fucking act fake in different environmentsÔºå see you talk to them one way„ÄÇ

 you act different in front of one clientÔºå you act different in front of other coworkerers„ÄÇ

 you act different when your boss is present than when he's math„ÄÇ

 when they see you acting out a characterÔºå when they see those incongruencies„ÄÇ

 they know you not to be trusted man„ÄÇNot only is this shit fucking up Kas hat lives„ÄÇ

 it's also fucking up their careerÔºå it's fucking up every aspect of their relationships with other humans„ÄÇ

 humans don't like this shit dude„ÄÇIt's why I harp so muchÔºå it's why I say it„ÄÇ

By the first commandment„ÄÇTake personal responsibility for your life„ÄÇ

 then the second commandment to know who you areÔºå know what you wantÔºå and don't compromise that shit„ÄÇ

People want to be around others whose thoughtsÔºå wordsÔºå and actions are in alignment„ÄÇ

Make sure you're one of these people„ÄÇAt at a minimum„ÄÇ

 make a list of all the reasons that you are legitimately proud to be the man you are already„ÄÇ

Know your values and goals and live by them congruently„ÄÇAnd continuously„ÄÇ

Make sure you're taking action every day to be an even better version of yourself„ÄÇ

These are a few simple behaviors that any human with a bit of self respect could put in action this week„ÄÇ

You can start building the habit to start habituating yourself„ÄÇ

 to present yourself in a more compelling way in a congruent and consistent way that shows your values„ÄÇ

 it shows your goals in a way that can make other people trust you„ÄÇ

That you are who you present yourself to be„ÄÇAnd they know if they hang out with you„ÄÇ

 you're not going to f around„ÄÇNot going to get distracted by shit„ÄÇ

 that would violate the core relationship tenantets of you and that person doing cool shit together and getting shit done„ÄÇ

Your business partner wants to know if they don't need a contract with you to know that you're not going to change your fucking mind later„ÄÇ

 but you're still going to be on task and get shit done„ÄÇ

 you're going to help each other accomplish your goals„ÄÇ

Your woman wants to know that she doesn't need a fucking contract for you to be fucking around on her„ÄÇ

Women don't want to spend their prime years with a guy when they don't know who he is with fucking he wants„ÄÇ

 because she knows fucking10 years laterÔºå if you have a fucking different optionÔºå a better option„ÄÇ

 if something you perceive as a better option in the short term„ÄÇ

 you're likely to go fuck somebody elseÔºå get some other woman knocked up„ÄÇ

Leave her for lesser well then God knows what„ÄÇWomen are evolutionarily adapted to see this shit and be very turned off when they see a guy who's not seen himself„ÄÇ

This congruence and consistency really allows you to stand out in a very positive way for very minimal effort„ÄÇ

 to just the effort of thinking through your own kinddm identity and being unapologetic for who you are„ÄÇ

 what you wantÔºå what you stand forÔºå who's going to be a good companion to live that life with you„ÄÇ

I want to stress againÔºå you don't have to be super successful in life ready„ÄÇ

You're a young man at really any age and you don't have a tremendous amount of accomplishment under your belt ready„ÄÇ

Gues what most other people your age don't eitherÔºå most other people have just been doing normal shit„ÄÇ

 just average shit having average life outcomes and being content enough with it and not really motivated to do shit simply by listening to this program you' self selected that you're not one of those people„ÄÇ

If you were interested in normal average shiftÔºå you won be listening to my vans„ÄÇ

You' going to be going out of your way to meet other guys like yourself„ÄÇ

You just be fucking off with some potato chips and beerer on a couch„ÄÇ

 watching a fucking sports game or something„ÄÇP simply seenÔºå you have some integrityÔºå a plan„ÄÇ

 and a path„ÄÇMakes you stand out far above all those others„ÄÇ

The probably the previous commandments implement this as well„ÄÇ

You're going to be welled into the 99th percentile of attractive men out there when you find the type of woman that's compatible with you„ÄÇ

 she's going to game you up„ÄÇShe's going to help solve logistics for you„ÄÇ

She's going to be excited to follow your lead„ÄÇ She's going to be an enthusiastic and loyal partner You could have a tremendous life experience with„ÄÇ

It won't take you three goddamn years to come to these conclusions like it took Owen and I„ÄÇ

 you can do this in the next twoÔºå three months„ÄÇYou could exemplify a lot of these behaviors this week„ÄÇ

 think they shit through deeplyÔºå and then just be yourself man„ÄÇ

After you've got this part of your life in orderÔºå invite her alarm to spend more time with you so you can both get a sense of each other's lives Point is not at all to impress the girl„ÄÇ

Only for both of you to find out in more detailÔºå if you have legitimate compatibility„ÄÇ

 I only stress the point of achievement so muchÔºå so your life is getting closer to optimal„ÄÇ

So you have other things to focus on and you don't catch oneitis and act like a ch when you find an amazing girl that would have been naturally compatible with you if you stop fucking around and just acted like yourself„ÄÇ

These masks and facades that guys are putting on because they don't want to offend and they don't want to alienate and they don't want to come off too strong or to this or too that„ÄÇ

You'ressing on your own feedÔºå dude„ÄÇThe guys act this way fucking it's like they're taking their little dick out„ÄÇ

 they're aiming it right at their footÔºå kissing all over their shoe„ÄÇAnd they sayÔºåDrek„ÄÇ

 why are I toes soggyÔºå why do I feel this moisture in my shoeÔºå stop this man„ÄÇ

 if you're one of these people that's cool in this shit to yourselfÔºå stop it todayÔºå ever again„ÄÇ

Women are naturally attracted to guys that are at ease„ÄÇF comfortable in their own skin„ÄÇ

 feel comfortable being themselves„ÄÇIt's easy for a pretty woman to be in the presence of a guy like that„ÄÇ

Because most other guys started acting real needy„ÄÇTry to impress her„ÄÇ

 try to do all sorts of creepy shit in front of her or to her„ÄÇ

To get her attention and differentiate themselves in the wrong way„ÄÇ

 this is just you presenting in your way of beingÔºå presenting who you sincerely are„ÄÇ

She'll be excited to spend time with a guy like youÔºå even if it doesn't go somewhere„ÄÇ

 and even if you and her aren't compatibleÔºå she knows if she has fucking hot friends„ÄÇ

They would enjoy spending time with to do it like you„ÄÇAnd should be excited to invite them along„ÄÇ

That's like a new social asset in her environmentÔºå spending time with a guy that's just cool and relaxed„ÄÇ

 even if it ain't for herÔºå it's not her a specific brand or type of guy that she's exactly excited about„ÄÇ

 it's be really easy for her to endorse you to her friends who she knows has been looking for a guy like you„ÄÇ

You pay yourself great dividends by being that type of guy„ÄÇ

Another of those dividends is when a woman does like youÔºå she's going to be reaching out to you„ÄÇ

're going to be on your path going about your lifeÔºå she's going to be texting and calling you„ÄÇ

 she's going to be hitting you up asking for your time and attention„ÄÇNot a bad place to be inÔºå man„ÄÇ

Here's the next commentÔºå Pi„ÄÇAfter you have a woman's attention„ÄÇ

 we don't take the next steps to logistically move things forward and invite her to your life„ÄÇ

You have to think one of the following„ÄÇEither you don't really like her much„ÄÇ

 therefore you must have better options or she's not the type of girl that you get excited about„ÄÇ

Youre a loser and have nothing cool to do in your life„ÄÇ

 therefore there are literally those short term or long term adventures for her to be a part of„ÄÇ

Les not in sight„ÄÇOr you're some kind of pussy in which case cool stuff may or may not exist in your life and she'd be excited to learn more about it„ÄÇ

 you're too much of a coward to invite her to spend time with you so she really doesn't have the option to find out she's just going to go somewhere else instead„ÄÇ

Don't fall into any of those traps„ÄÇGragmatic application of this commandment„ÄÇ

Build a lights for proud to live„ÄÇIf you want to consistently and sustainably attract nines and tens„ÄÇ

 you need to be a nine or a1„ÄÇThere's no tip trick or tactic that's going to overcome this reality„ÄÇ

You can be a six and dateta physical nineÔºå whos otherwise an overall four„ÄÇ

 but if you're going to date women that are overall ninesÔºå better you pretty well developed yourself„ÄÇ

Pro a quote from Charlie Mungger„ÄÇHe says the best way to get what you want in life is to deserve it„ÄÇ

The world isn't insane enough to go around highly rewarding undeserving people„ÄÇ

If you don't feel like a superhero at the momentÔºå again don't worry about it„ÄÇ

 the next best thing to being the guy that you wish you already were is to be clearly focused on becoming that person in the future„ÄÇ

Youthful ambition can frankly be even more sexy than actual success„ÄÇ

When contrasted against the sea of losers out there„ÄÇ

 you look pretty damn good just being a man with a plan who's executing on it„ÄÇ

A note about entitlement„ÄÇAs my assistantÔºå Seanun explains in even more detail„ÄÇ

Entitlement isn't like an emotion or some childish exuberance a man feels„ÄÇ

Entitlement is not a child like gidiness„ÄÇTitlement is actually a lack of emotiontitlement is exactly what you feel when you turn on your light switch at home„ÄÇ

It's what you feel when you put your shoes on before you go outside„ÄÇ

At of men get confused by entitlement„ÄÇFind it just shocking and how many really high quality men show up on boot camp„ÄÇ

And somehow magically think they have lower value than an average woman„ÄÇ

There are a lot of fantastic guys out there that are misperceiving their legitimate values„ÄÇ

Please pay close attention here„ÄÇI'm not telling anybody to be a narcissist„ÄÇ

 am I telling anybody to have sex and relationships where they are so emotionless„ÄÇ

 it's what you feel when you turn on your light switch„ÄÇI wouldn't say that at all is ridiculous„ÄÇ

 The whole point for me or you or anybody elseÔºå The reason that we got drawn into game is we could have better relationships and happier emotions and just more fulfilling life over all„ÄÇ

üòäÔºåBut on the other extremeÔºå make sure you're giving yourself legitimate credit for your actual accomplishments„ÄÇ

No doubt you've already done a long list of things that have differentiated you from others already„ÄÇ

Just like you might be discounting yourself and your legitimate value or accomplishments„ÄÇ

 make sure on the other extreme you're not idealizing a woman„ÄÇ

Don't put women down and I think they're less than they are„ÄÇ

 but get to know and be objective about who she is and what she is and what type of path you could possibly have going forward together„ÄÇ

Sure all don't idealize her to think that she's something mystical or some cyber and that's going to change her life„ÄÇ

A woman's not going to do much of anything for you that you can't do for yourself or that another woman won't be excited to do in the right circumstance„ÄÇ

Don't idealize any woman with any of this crazy mysticism or„ÄÇHad a physical attribute„ÄÇ

 it's that she's fucking otherworlly princessÔºå GodsÔºå et cetera„ÄÇ

 you must have bumped your head if you believe that shit„ÄÇ

Homen don't want to be idealized and men don't want to be idealized either when you idealize another human„ÄÇ

 you conveying your own  about who they areÔºå simultaneously putting in a lot of pressure on them to live up the crazy expectations that they never signed up for„ÄÇ

Some fools that go around idealizing women and other men for that matter„ÄÇ

And later or mad when these people don't live up to their expectations„ÄÇ

Goddeth had never agreed to live up to your expectations„ÄÇ

You created a little fantasy world in your headÔºå you impose that on somebody else„ÄÇ

 you idealize the individualÔºå then you idealize the relationship„ÄÇ

 then guys get but hurt later when the girl doesn't live up some standard that she didn't even know existed and never agreed to live up to„ÄÇ

If you're one of these guysÔºå top this shit immediately„ÄÇ

Don't let people who are closelyky idealize you either„ÄÇ

And you're the type of guy that's like very eically motivated and always gloing about your accomplishments during good times„ÄÇ

Taking full credit or even more credit than is objectively due when things are going well for you„ÄÇ

 guess what's going to happen laterÔºå man„ÄÇWhen something bad happens„ÄÇ

 first it's going to hurt your ego and lessen your self esteem because you're not living up to your own identity or your own self concept„ÄÇ

Which was unsustainable and idealistic itself„ÄÇThen on top of that„ÄÇ

 because you're been playing this absurd character in front of others„ÄÇ

They're going to think it's incongruentÔºå they're going to say what's wrong with Tude„ÄÇ

 he's acting the same success that he's always had„ÄÇAnd on top of thatÔºå look how buttered he is„ÄÇ

üéºÊ¨° okay„ÄÇBut I can think is he okay in a good way you're going think of likeÔºå ohÔºü

We need to get him professional help because he's suicidal„ÄÇ

He said maybe I should send him to a doctor and then break up with him and go find a real man„ÄÇ

This is not an thing„ÄÇWhen you let other people idealizeSU„ÄÇ

 later around they're going to demonizeU tooÔºå as soon as you have a hard time„ÄÇ

 soon as something goes wrong„ÄÇYou're going to find out really quick that like all the people that like put up with your gloating and your cockiness and your arrogance on the one hand„ÄÇ

 they're going to be gone real quickÔºå dudeÔºå they're going to be gone real quick„ÄÇ

Just when you're having the toughest time in your relationship„ÄÇ

 that's when your girl feels that incongruency and then she starts to test you„ÄÇ

 maybe even mock you behind your back you're going to feel like damnÔºåWhat's going on hereÔºü

When things were going goodÔºå like I shared that with EarthÔºå I thought everything was cool„ÄÇ

 I thought everything was goodÔºå why is she treating me this wayÔºü

Well she's evolutionarily developed to do thatÔºå it's not her faultÔºå she's not being a bad woman„ÄÇ

 quite literally you were being a bad man by creating false expectations in her head„ÄÇ

About the type of person you are and then behaving in a way as if it was going to be that way forever or an eternity„ÄÇ

When she sees these incongruenciesÔºå she see that you had too much bravadoÔºå talk too much shit„ÄÇ

 then couldn't live up to that standard or that you've created in the minds of yourself and others„ÄÇ

She feels like she needs to go find another man„ÄÇYou'll look weak„ÄÇ

 she'll be emotionally compelled to go elsewhereÔºå how do you overcome thisÔºüOh man„ÄÇ

 you be well served during fantastic timesÔºå just be a little humble„ÄÇ

To let people around you know that you're having a great time and yeah everything's amazing but you probably have some tough times in the future probably have some other victories as well just let them know that you're a human„ÄÇ

 don't put crazy ideas in your own head that during great times it's always going to be a great time„ÄÇ

 nothing bad could ever happen again„ÄÇJust about zero humans have ever had this experience„ÄÇ

And the ones that indulge in it with too much hubrisÔºå too much ego„ÄÇManÔºå it don't end well for them„ÄÇ

You're going to feel disappointed in yourselfÔºå you're going disappointed a lot of others if you can't have a little bit humbleness and humility to let them know some of your vulnerabilities or some of your concerns„ÄÇ

And when you have quality friendsÔºå franklyÔºå a lot people be really happy to help you to overcome those things so they could feel like they contributed to the good times and they know that you would be a trusted and loyal friend that if they had a bad time you'd still be there for them„ÄÇ

And you're not going to have hold them to some crazy standard either„ÄÇ

This is really a foundational piece of ecology that you should be implementing in all of these relationships to make sure that they're long term stable„ÄÇ

 mutually beneficialÔºå and so your friends and like partner really honor and cherish you„ÄÇ

Wepect you who you areÔºå and so they can feel that you will honor and cherish them and not just be a fair weather friend if things don't work out well in their lives„ÄÇ

When you behave this wayÔºå most girls are actually extremely loyal to their man„ÄÇ

üéºIf you don't act too arrogant when things are going well„ÄÇ

 your girl won't be too much of a bitch when things are going bad„ÄÇ Just be likeÔºå oh„ÄÇ

 he told me about this„ÄÇ OhÔºå yeah„ÄÇ This is what we talked about„ÄÇ OhÔºå it's cool„ÄÇ He's a champ„ÄÇ

He's very self awareÔºå he'll be able to turn this aroundÔºå things are going to be great again„ÄÇ

It gives her a real sense of loyalty and commitment to stick it out with you„ÄÇ

It's just going to be great for your confidence and self esteem to turn things around and get back on a winning track Everybody has setbacks man„ÄÇ

I have all my mentors haveÔºå my business mentorsÔºå my pickup mentors„ÄÇ

All the best role novelists in the world have had these setbacks„ÄÇ

You wouldn't want to learn shit from a guy who never failed at the thing that they later got great at„ÄÇ

Not a very qualified teacher„ÄÇLookÔºå here's another aspect of idealizing women„ÄÇ

I let women compete in all sorts of ways to deceive a man and garner more attention than other women„ÄÇ

She basically just sees likeÔºå what do all these men respond to„ÄÇ

 and she tries to present herself as such„ÄÇAnd unfortunately„ÄÇ

 a lot of these are superficial attributes„ÄÇBut for herÔºå it's the reality of what she's dealing with„ÄÇ

So the reality of stuff that the media shows her„ÄÇAnd the ideals that she thinks society expects her to live up to„ÄÇ

Or would value her more if she were able to live up to those idealsÔºüFrom her perspective„ÄÇ

 this is just a smart marketing plan„ÄÇMore detail on this in Commandment 10„ÄÇ

Some of these club girls are an absolute wreck„ÄÇIf you went home with them„ÄÇ

 you wouldn't be surprised to find out„ÄÇBut they have some cho or sugar daddy pain their vent„ÄÇ

 have little or no furniture„ÄÇLittle or no food in the house„ÄÇ

 it's not something that helps her achieve her goals„ÄÇ

 a lot of these girls just think that food is something that makes her fat„ÄÇ

 plus not a good investment over time or money„ÄÇShe may well have drugs in her apartment or in her bedroom„ÄÇ

Most of our net worth is probably tied up in makeup and fashion accessories„ÄÇ

 more on this as well in Mamment1„ÄÇI've seen this on boot camp lot„ÄÇ

 but there's one story that really stuck out to me„ÄÇI met this fellowÔºå he was a law firm partner„ÄÇ

He had so much big shit going on in his lifeÔºå kept himself in very reasonable shape for his age„ÄÇ

 well groomedÔºå good looking fella„ÄÇVery confident at the most every respect„ÄÇBut we were on boot camp„ÄÇ

And wellÔºå he's in his early40sÔºå and he's looking at a woman in her early 30s„ÄÇ

And I just see in his body languageÔºå he just scared her death to go approach herÔºå he wants to do it„ÄÇ

's physically attracted to her„ÄÇBut see I see the cogs turning in his head of like assessing his own value or thinking like oh I„ÄÇ

 ohÔºå should I blow me outÔºå oh this might happen and who knows what the hell he was thinking„ÄÇ

 but I got the idea that he was feeling insecure to go talk to the girl„ÄÇ

I came and chatted with him brieflyÔºå I just stood by him and put him in his ear likeÔºå dude„ÄÇ

 well you're scanning here idealizing that girlÔºå she's just here for fucking getting drunk„ÄÇ

 she just't wants to come out and have a couple drinks to get drunk and he actually put a lot of makeup on she got a little glitter around her eyes and this and that„ÄÇ

But if you went back for a place„ÄÇYou may well find out she's sleeping on a goddamn with her mattress„ÄÇ

 her worldly belongings consists of a box of makeupÔºå about eight pairs of shoesÔºå six dresses„ÄÇ

In a cat litter boxÔºå she may or may not have a cat„ÄÇ

 but she's probably got a dirty cat litter box sitting around the place somewhere„ÄÇ

And he and I had a chuckle about itÔºå and then he went over there and chatted up the girl„ÄÇ

One of my assistants was Wingham„ÄÇAnd he and my assistant pulled that girl and her friend and took them home that night„ÄÇ

And he told me the next day of likeÔºå God damnÔºå like you were just an epiphany to him„ÄÇ

The misjudges value so much„ÄÇAnd although she's like a very pretty„ÄÇ

 very delightful girl to hang out withÔºå he has so much more going on in his life„ÄÇ

 he's such a more developed person than she is„ÄÇBut I think he vowed to himself that day to never make that mistake again„ÄÇ

So I just want to reiterate to you one more time„ÄÇDon't idealize a woman„ÄÇ

 don't let others idealize you„ÄÇKnow who you areÔºå know who you wantÔºå get your as in there„ÄÇ

Convey your personalityÔºå convey your sense of humorÔºå convey your identity„ÄÇ

 be a good marketer on these channels„ÄÇAnd help her make an informed decision„ÄÇ

 she's super excited to be spending time with a guy like you or not„ÄÇ

Get your ass out there and open a lot of sets„ÄÇConvey this information to each one of them as if the girl you're speaking to and that interaction may well be the girl of your dreams might be the girl that you were excited to me„ÄÇ

 the premier girl from your target market that your over meet in your damn lifetime„ÄÇ

And like Winston Churchill saidÔºå success is walking from failure to failure with no loss of enthusiasm„ÄÇ

Although that would be pretty damn dramatic to think about in this contextÔºå like oh failureÔºå failure„ÄÇ

No you have a failure of fitment and goalsÔºå you have a failure of compatibility„ÄÇ

 it's a great thing to understand that in two minutes instead of 20„ÄÇ

 get onto the next girl when you behave like thisÔºå this puts you in the buyer's position„ÄÇ

It makes you the judge if your time spent with her is time well spent„ÄÇ

It makes you the judge if you and your buddiesÔºå you and your wingman„ÄÇ

 should be hanging out with her or gettching them to go to the bathroom and so to speak and go meet some difference for both„ÄÇ

This idea that a woman is aed and a man somehow has not is very misguided„ÄÇ

I never feel like I get rejected in the club any more„ÄÇ

 I only feel like Ive discovered that some women and I are not compatible together„ÄÇ

And then I keep it moving and I go find one who's very compatible with me so I can enjoy awesome my attributes of having that type of relationship with a new woman„ÄÇ

I sincerely think about it like talking to the girlÔºå if she didn't perceive me as awesome„ÄÇ

 she sincerely lost out on a much bigger opportunity than I did„ÄÇ

 if she and I were to spend time togetherÔºå it wouldn't change my life that dramatically„ÄÇ

 but it would change her as a whole hell of a lotÔºå it would change hers for the better„ÄÇ

I'm not mad at a girl if she doesn't see the value in spending time with me„ÄÇReally wish her well„ÄÇ

 And I'm very certain that my life's going to be awesome with or without her„ÄÇ

 I want you to be cautious to not spend time with a woman who isn't thrilled to be spending time with you„ÄÇ

You're only creating a management problem for your future„ÄÇ

Don't be addict to your future self by creating these problems for short term gains„ÄÇ

The lack of enthusiasm will be bad for your self esteem„ÄÇ

Its claim to manifest in a growing rement in both of you„ÄÇThis leads to contempt„ÄÇ

 contempt leads to pray come„ÄÇIt's number one thing that's been scientifically studiedied in psychology„ÄÇ

number one precursor to a man and a woman breaking up is those contemptuous feelings for each other It happens because people get into relationships all the time with people they weren't compatible to be with please look at some superficial attributes or ignore rather obvious evidence„ÄÇ

They're not long term compatible with that person„ÄÇFor a lot of guys„ÄÇ

 for a guy that doesn't have a lot of options„ÄÇYou'll tend to get into relationships with a woman one notch better than he dated before and for him if he perceives that as an opportunity based on those superficial physical indicators or a couple superficial personality attributes without really doing his due diligence and knowing what he's getting himself into this always leads to trouble down the road don't be addict to your future self through your due diligence„ÄÇ

 make sure she knows who you are then move it forward„ÄÇAll you need to do is hit on a few more girls„ÄÇ

 manÔºå and have a lot more sex until you find a good fit„ÄÇExercises to help implement this commandment„ÄÇ

Make a list of five things that are already going great in your life„ÄÇ

And that are directly attributable to an action you took in the past„ÄÇ

Make sure you're giving yourself appropriate credit for these past accomplishments„ÄÇ

We'll alsote on your path to habituate the best practices outlined in the  Ten0 condemnments of game„ÄÇ

Maagine how you would spend your time if you already had more money than you would ever spend in your life„ÄÇ

Imagine how you would behave on beautiful womenÔºå if you are already having sex with a lot of beautiful women to the point you felt a bit exhausted from it„ÄÇ

Really sit and think that one through„ÄÇThere's no reason you can't behave like that right now„ÄÇ

üéºLet's combine them together„ÄÇ In factÔºå how would behave around a woman be $100 million dollars in the bank„ÄÇ

Just had a three son with two hot twins this morning and happened to be out in the club tonight catch up with your best friends„ÄÇ

Donren't you think you might feel a little annoyed she wasn't bringing value to the interactionÔºü

I sure as hell would„ÄÇDon't throw away your financial goals being delusional about your current financial situation„ÄÇ

 don't do stupid shit to sabotage your interactions with women„ÄÇ

 being arrogant or cocky about financial or other attributes that you don't have yet„ÄÇ

Do be decisive by implementing the elements of this thought experiment into your behavior right now„ÄÇ

He'd be left needing„ÄÇBe less eager„ÄÇThe more relaxed„ÄÇIt'd be more fun to be around„ÄÇ

And you and the girl both would have a tremendously better time„ÄÇFinally„ÄÇ

 will you run into girls in your normal weekÔºüInvite them to come do cool shit with you„ÄÇ

 you should already be doing cool stuff with your friends„ÄÇ

 whatever you and your friends are doing this weekÔºå every girl you talk to„ÄÇ

 invite them to come with if 20 of them show up that's perfect don't worry about it„ÄÇ

Go meet hot girlsÔºå they have cool shit going on in your life alreadyÔºå invite them to join your fun„ÄÇ

A personal example of how I think on this„ÄÇI feel like in my value proposition with the woman„ÄÇ

That the woman benefits in many ways spending time with me„ÄÇA few of those ways„ÄÇ

She's going to get to travel and see the world„ÄÇI travel about 51 weeks per year„ÄÇ

The only way for us to spend time together at allÔºå it's for to come with me„ÄÇ

She'll be exposed to a tremendous amount of cultural and scenic variety on those adventures„ÄÇ

She'll often be eating at the best restaurants at whatever city we're in„ÄÇ

These may be really expensive restaurants might just be some cheap place that it has amazing food„ÄÇ

 point is not to impress the girlÔºå is to invite her to whatever sort of lifestyle that you'd be living if you're there by yourself or there with your friends„ÄÇ

The girl spends time with meÔºå she's going to learn about communicationÔºå businessÔºå psychology„ÄÇ

 she's going to learn about fitness and exercise„ÄÇShell be consuming many„ÄÇ

 many books and documentariesÔºå audio books as well„ÄÇShe's going to be around my team„ÄÇ

The team comprise many other smart and motivated men„ÄÇAll of them are an expert at some point„ÄÇ

 we're constantly learning from each other to be better individualsÔºå and to be a better team overall„ÄÇ

She's going to be invited to that and be a part of that tribe„ÄÇ

 she' have tremendous advantages that a woman who was not part of that could never experience for themselves„ÄÇ

Crolls are hanging out with a bunch of loseisrs„ÄÇShe can have access to some of the best nutrients and vitamins available on her„ÄÇ

And have access to the best beauty care products available on Earth„ÄÇ

Youing to have access to higher quality clothes„ÄÇ This doesn't mean just the designer labels and expensive clothes„ÄÇ

 It also means higher quality fabricexÔºå things that are just more comfortable to wear„ÄÇ

In a greater variety of clothesÔºå because you're going' to see a lot of different things in different cultures where we're traveling„ÄÇ

She basically would be stronger and more confident in every damn facet of her life„ÄÇ

If I go talk to 100 beautiful womenÔºå many don't value this kind of adventure„ÄÇ

Some might think education is boringÔºå the cool things to do are like lay in the sun„ÄÇ

Ding champagne at noonÔºå do cocaine at midnight„ÄÇI don't fuck with people like that„ÄÇ

Some don't like to travelÔºå they prefer to stay home alone for any number of reasons„ÄÇTop among them„ÄÇ

 I presume to watch reality TV and get fat„ÄÇSomewhat touched my lifestyle is too abnormal„ÄÇ

 just not relatable„ÄÇOn and on„ÄÇThere's a lot of reasons a girl wouldn't want to step up and live the lifestyle I'm living I'm going to expect her to go to the gym I'm going to expect her to eat healthier I'm expect her to fucking be polite around my friends and very presentable around my business partners„ÄÇ

 friendsÔºå anyone that I'm being around chance to treat them with respect and decency because that's sure is how how they're going to treat her„ÄÇ

All this is fine thoughÔºå if any particular woman isn't excited to join my life adventure„ÄÇ

 no damn well another one will be„ÄÇI know it won't take me long to find her„ÄÇ

When I think I see a great opportunity with a woman„ÄÇ

 make sure she understands me well and make sure I understand her well„ÄÇ

Persistent when I see something I'm excited about„ÄÇYou can't cross that line from persistence to neediness„ÄÇ

You can't cross that line from marketing to sales„ÄÇWhen you get into that realm of convincing and persuading„ÄÇ

S's not going to go well„ÄÇThis behavior will consistently backfire„ÄÇ

 even if you get the girl in the short termÔºå again„ÄÇ

 it's not the type of girl that you'd want to be around in the long term„ÄÇ

Gys make all sorts of rationalizations why they should keep her around„ÄÇ

Don't be addict to your future self manÔºå just go through the process and find the best girls for you„ÄÇ

When you find that girl and you want her to follow your lead„ÄÇ

 let her know the time spent with you will'll be saved„ÄÇFun and adventurous„ÄÇLiterally tell her„ÄÇ

If you come with meÔºå it'll be safeÔºå it'll be funÔºå it'll be an adventure„ÄÇ

 and if you're not totally excitedÔºå you can leave it any time„ÄÇ

Mostt wander your life plan to convince blind people to see„ÄÇLike my grandma always said„ÄÇ

 can lead a ho of water so you can't make her drink„ÄÇOne more note about Jackie and the wrong women„ÄÇ

When you reject the wrong kind of womanÔºå this allows the next woman to realize that you're a man of integrity„ÄÇ

It builds your own self esteemÔºå it builds your entitlement„ÄÇ

Recent people talk about entitlements how much„ÄÇAnd you can't fake that ship„ÄÇ

 it's a very honest indicator of how you feel about yourself„ÄÇ

 what you think your status is in the world„ÄÇAnd what type of people you think you're supposed to be spending your life withÔºü

When you reject the girl who's wrong for youÔºå when you reject the girl is not living up to your standards„ÄÇ

Now from a countrywayÔºå that as some technique for routine„ÄÇ

Out of a place of sincerity and authenticity of you just living by your goals and adhering to your values„ÄÇ

When you look the next woman in the eyeÔºå she can sense right awayÔºå if you don't like her„ÄÇ

 you just walk away„ÄÇShe can see that you might like her and you' sure as hell don't need her„ÄÇ

It's extremely attractive because it's extremely hard to fake for a beautiful woman it's a rare opportunity to meet a guy like that if you have the rest of your life in order a good amount of compatibility with each other„ÄÇ

 she'll chase youÔºå she'll convince you you're supposed to be together„ÄÇ

She'll do this because she knows if you're not impressed with her„ÄÇ

 you'll be the one explaining why it's time to leave like oh my friends and I have to go to the bathroom„ÄÇ

 Oh I just remembered it's time to feed my pet caterpillar„ÄÇO„ÄÇ

I've had a premonition that my friend's doghouse is on fire„ÄÇ

 I need to call them and make sure fluffy is okayÔºå Ex me„ÄÇAt the end of the day„ÄÇ

 you'll eventually end up dating exactly the quality of woman that you'd be willing to walk away from„ÄÇ

You don't get to keep a woman that you feel needy around„ÄÇ

When a man feels like he needs a particular woman and treats her as such„ÄÇ

Ping the seeds of their break out right there„ÄÇHe'sstructing her to give him a lot of headaches„ÄÇ

Te him harder go seek a better man„ÄÇYou're making her do it„ÄÇGuys are doing this to themselves„ÄÇ

 and be one of these fellowsÔºå assses on his own feetÔºå sabotages his own relationships„ÄÇ

Because you feel needy around the woman„ÄÇP your game upÔºå all these 10 commandments„ÄÇ

you'll be able to avoid these type of problems from your life„ÄÇ

One more personal story from a girl I met in the club„ÄÇ

We met this beautiful Australian pel in a big city nightclub„ÄÇ

My friends and I had bottle service that nightÔºå means we spent a few thousand dollars for the table we were sitting at„ÄÇ

 so we had a nice place to sit and we got about $80 worth of vodca for our money„ÄÇ

So this beautiful young woman flutters byÔºå I got upÔºå I grabbed her„ÄÇ

toldold her you're gorgeous had to come meet youÔºå abducting you nowÔºå come with me„ÄÇI let her over„ÄÇ

 I had her sit next to me„ÄÇI don't offer her a drink„ÄÇ

 I don't offer anything to sit her down and we start chatting„ÄÇ

I potentially might think we're doing so„ÄÇShe asked me if it's okay to take her shoes off„ÄÇ

 she said her feet really hurtÔºå I saidÔºå that's greatÔºå no problem„ÄÇWe're chatting in 15 20 minutes„ÄÇ

We're really getting along quite wellÔºå I know a lot of things about her culture of her continent„ÄÇ

It's her first time visiting mine„ÄÇSo it's very unlikely she could meet anybody else that would know more about where she came from and would be a great tour guide to show her around where I'm from„ÄÇ

 She really appreciates us for having a great interaction„ÄÇI brought up to earth„ÄÇ

 one thing that really bothers me about our country is they have really terrible service there„ÄÇ

Service people suck this is pretty much because they have an extremely high minimum wage they bake 10 or 11 times what an American would make in the service industry„ÄÇ

AndBecause of thisÔºå they're not actually incentivized to provide you good service„ÄÇ

Cause they don't get tips over there so they pretty much really incentivized to provide you ship service so you'll just go away quicker and then they don't have to do any work at all and they continue to make their high minimum wage In any case„ÄÇ

 when I brought this upÔºå she saysÔºå ohÔºå but you know they deserve to make the same money as everyone else„ÄÇ

I so what„ÄÇAnd I said  let me get this rightÔºå you think everyone is equal and there should be no differentiation based on their skills or work ethic or intelligence„ÄÇ

 etc ceter„ÄÇShe's likeÔºå you knowÔºå wellÔºå I just don't see why you know„ÄÇ

 anybody should really get paid more than anybody else„ÄÇI'm likeÔºå all right„ÄÇMy friend over there„ÄÇ

 he's a doctor„ÄÇHe literally saves people's lives like do you think my doctor friend„ÄÇ

 you should be making like the same money as a McConned's workerÔºü

After he spent 10 years in school and hundreds of thousands of dollars on his educationÔºå she's like„ÄÇ

Wow„ÄÇHe probably likes being a doctorÔºå I just don't see why he should make much more money than anybody else„ÄÇ

I'm like oh you love socialism and that's greatÔºå you love socialismÔºå you should leave here„ÄÇ

 you shouldn't have come to America you should be in Venezuela the average Venezuelans lost 19 pounds„ÄÇ

 it's a little over 8 kilos this yearÔºå should be down there while people are starving and really embrace that socialism instead instead us sitting here at my table that my friends and I paid thousands of dollars for well you're denouncing capitalism tell us we don't deserve to live lifestyles that we' created for ourselves like I'll tell you whatÔºü

Take those shoesÔºå put those shoes back on your feet right now„ÄÇ

She's looking at me kind of funny like it's a joke like I'm fucking around likeÔºå noÔºå take the shoes„ÄÇ

 put the shoes on your feet„ÄÇStand upÔºå go stand over there with those peasants„ÄÇ

 go stand over there with the normal people so you can have sore feet and enjoy socialism with them„ÄÇ

Some guy would say to me„ÄÇThe director„ÄÇTo grow all back how that could gain„ÄÇ

You said she was really pretty girl when she walked away how was dark court came„ÄÇlet me explain„ÄÇ

What does it do for my sense of entitlementÔºå what does it do for my feelings of self assureddness to my confidenceÔºü

When a girl who I think didn' think was a very beautiful girl„ÄÇ

 and a lot of her brain dysfunction may just be a part of her youth and a lack of experience in life„ÄÇ

 she's like 21 or 22 or something„ÄÇWhat do you think it does to me internally when I tell that girl to get the help out of hereÔºü

I'll tell you what when I go talk to another girl that looks just like her„ÄÇ

 an next girl sees it in my eyesÔºå it's not something you can fake„ÄÇ

 it's not something you can manipulateÔºå she sees in your eyes that you're judging her„ÄÇ

 you're not convinced about her valueÔºå you are convinced of your own value if she's not up to your standard„ÄÇ

She's not going to be it loud in your presenceÔºå I don't know what the hell is more compelling and or more of an opportunity for a woman and to meet a guy like that„ÄÇ
