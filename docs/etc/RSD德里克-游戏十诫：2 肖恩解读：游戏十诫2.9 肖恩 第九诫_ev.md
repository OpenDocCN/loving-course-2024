Commanment 9Ôºå thou shalt help others accomplish their goals„ÄÇSo in this section„ÄÇ

 we're going to talk about something a little bit different„ÄÇ

 which is how to build other people's values I'm going to go pretty deep on why this is important because this is a concept that's not often talked about in this area„ÄÇ

 and I've seen it have tremendous effects for me for Derek and for everyone else in our life in particular„ÄÇ

 we're going to talk about the massive advantages that building a tribe brings to your life„ÄÇ

One thing that we have done better than anyone is build a crew of extremely solid guys that are killing it not only in this area„ÄÇ

 but in every areaÔºå The Derick crew consists of about 20 people on five continents„ÄÇ

 and every guy in our crew is either an entrepreneurÔºå a high tier professional„ÄÇ

 like lawyer or dentists are at the very top of another field like hospitality or sales„ÄÇ In addition„ÄÇ

 we have all been with well over 100 girlsÔºå travel the world and frequently attend exclusive events„ÄÇ

 Those successes areÔºå in part because while we are primarily thinking about our own projects and goals„ÄÇ

 We are constantly collaborating on each other's projects and goals as well„ÄÇ

 because we each have different specialtiesÔºå skillsÔºå habits and ways of thinking„ÄÇ

 this creates a magnifying effectÔºå with each individual enjoying the collective benefits of the group„ÄÇ

 How do we create that effect„ÄÇ It starts with a simple paradigm shift„ÄÇ

 A shift from short term thinking and short term value grabs to long term thinking and long term loyalty„ÄÇ

 Most people live their life bouncing around to„ÄÇüòäÔºåWhoever has the most shortterm value you see this in social relationships„ÄÇ

 careersÔºå romantic relationshipsÔºå the entertainment industry and nearly every arena of life gravitating towards short termm value is ubiquitous and it makes sense right you want to go with a job with the highest pay you want to make the friends who are the most popular you want to focus on your project so that you can get ahead However„ÄÇ

 while people think this is long-term thinking because they are getting ahead unquote they're actually setting themselves up for long-term failure in the same way that a hedge fund will make 20% gains year after year„ÄÇ

 only to lose it all at the1 year markÔºå people will make short termm gains in their life that will never get them anywhere good Let me give you an example„ÄÇ

 I a female friends while growing up we knew each other in elementary school and middle school winds up going to a different high school to me She was very pretty and could make friends easily while she started off high school in one group of girls she soon found that some of the more popular girls were willing to let her into their group After ditching her original„ÄÇ

Friends and going to the new group for a few months„ÄÇ

 she then found again that an even more popular group of girls were willing to let her into that group„ÄÇ

 same thing happens„ÄÇ and she then sees that a group of upperclassmen girls want her in their group„ÄÇ

 These are the kids that threw all the parties„ÄÇ So she again ditches her friends for the next group„ÄÇ

 when the upperclassmen graduatedÔºå she had no friends„ÄÇ

 And since all her old friends in her old class now hated her she was left friendless„ÄÇ

 I saw her continue this pattern after high school and into her late 20s„ÄÇ

 and at this point in her lifeÔºå she does have a few high status friends because shes just been constantly climbing„ÄÇ

 but they've only known her for a year at most and they owe her absolutely nothing„ÄÇ In addition„ÄÇ

 the female friends she did have that will still talk to her find her manipulative and they would never do her any favors ever„ÄÇ

 You see less extreme or sometimes more extreme examples of this type of thinking in the vast vast majority of people people are constantly jocking for short- term status„ÄÇ

 short term funÔºå short term emotions and short term gains by making superficial relations„ÄÇ

They think they are networking„ÄÇ But in realityÔºå the relationships will net them maybe be 1% of what a real relationship will„ÄÇ

 The time getting a picture with a celebrity would have been better spent strengthening the relationships they currently have with so called no buddies„ÄÇ

 So what happens when you do the opposite of what my old friend did„ÄÇ Well„ÄÇ

 many of the girls in the original group ended up actually being very successful and could have offered her jobs„ÄÇ

 Other ones had built new strong relationships of their own that could have been very helpful to her in her career or lifestyle„ÄÇ

 I remember one girl in particular from that group actually ended up being an event planner for some of the most high status events in our city„ÄÇ

 But my friend opted for short termm gainsÔºå So she never got to go to those events„ÄÇ

 So while she technically won every battleÔºå she ultimately lost the war„ÄÇ

 Think for a second about why we evolved to be loyal„ÄÇ

 Why should we be loyal to anyone one at all if they're going through a hard time or if we don't see the value„ÄÇ

 Why should any human have any sense of loyalty„ÄÇ Is it because jeans are altruisticÔºå No„ÄÇ

 It's because those that felt compelled„ÄÇSaay truerue to the people they felt close to„ÄÇ

 even in the face of short term incentivesÔºå survived and replicated at higher rates than those that didn't„ÄÇ

 And while I urge you to be loyal because it's one of your values„ÄÇ

 and because you just want to do it„ÄÇ You should also understand its benefits„ÄÇ

10 year relationships aren't easy to come by„ÄÇ And a long relationship built on trust with someone half up the totem pole is always more valuable than an acquaintance with those at the top„ÄÇ

 which is better a picture with Obama or a real relationship with a senator„ÄÇ

 This is why Nassim TulebÔºå the bestselling writer of black Swwaan and antifr„ÄÇ

 always answers emails from no names rather than diligently answering emails from famous people„ÄÇ

 The ones at the bottom will definitely remember the favor„ÄÇ The ones at the top are just used to it„ÄÇ

 I have many examples of people I know that no one thought we're going to do anything„ÄÇ

 or that people thought were just finished that end up doing very well„ÄÇ In fact„ÄÇ

 I am an example of that„ÄÇ There's a period of my life where„ÄÇI was actually fairly close to death„ÄÇ

 And everyone in my life knew it„ÄÇ To this dayÔºå I can tell you exactly who answered the phone during that time and exactly the people that didn't at this point in my life„ÄÇ

 I can tell you exactly which friends help me with my projects and which ones don't The people that stayed loyal know that I would do anything for them„ÄÇ

 And they have many other friends who would do thatÔºå tooÔºå because they stayed loyal to them as well„ÄÇ

 with my own lifeÔºå I have gained exponentially by impactful favors from long-term relationships more than I ever would have from small favors from superficial relationships„ÄÇ

 And the thing is the implementation of this isn't even that hard„ÄÇ

 All you have to do is follow the 9010 rule„ÄÇ Was this mean it means spending 90% of your time on your own stuff and just 10% of time on other people's stuff„ÄÇ

 your friends stuff„ÄÇ This could mean your friends projects this could mean just doing them a favor„ÄÇ

 this could mean just helping them out through a hard time„ÄÇ

 because both of you are experts in different fields and naturally have different strengths„ÄÇ

 your 10% will be„ÄÇMassively impactful without draining all of your time„ÄÇ

 It's something that they can't do for themselvesÔºå but that you can do easily„ÄÇ

 You are adding in your own strengths„ÄÇ little caveat on this„ÄÇ Do this stuff for free„ÄÇ

 I highly encourage you to do this stuff for freeÔºå but remember to do it as an equal„ÄÇ

 not just find people you can work for for free and you're their little bitch and you really don't have a relationship with them„ÄÇ

 You're just working for someone for no reason„ÄÇ But if you do have a relationship with someone start thinking about what can you do for this person that no one else can„ÄÇ

 What kind of projects are they working on that you can help them with„ÄÇ

 What favors can you start doing for them„ÄÇ What issues are they having in their life where you can be there for them„ÄÇ

Would these things really take that much timeÔºå Some of them will„ÄÇ

 And I encourage you to do the ones that will take time as well„ÄÇ

 But a lot of these things are very small„ÄÇ They don't even take that much of your time„ÄÇ

 So take 10% of your timeÔºå spend it on other people„ÄÇ

 the people that you want to build relationships with„ÄÇ

 and just take the other 90% of your time and use it on your own stuff„ÄÇ

 That small sacrifice will have exponential gains for your life„ÄÇ NextÔºå the advantages of a tribe„ÄÇ

 What is the power of a tribe and what makes a tribe happenÔºü

 So what would happen if you took that long term thinking and loyalty thinking and applied it to a group of people„ÄÇ

 OhÔºå what happen if you applied it to two peopleÔºå Those two people are able to help each other out„ÄÇ

 rightÔºü What about three peopleÔºå WellÔºå now those guys can kind of trade specialties„ÄÇ

 They're each an expert on something different and they can trade specialties and maybe work on common goals„ÄÇ

 What about 10 guys will 10 guys could start a company together„ÄÇ

 Each having a different role within that companyÔºå100 guys could form an army„ÄÇ And one„ÄÇ

4 million guys could take over the world„ÄÇ As I saidÔºå 1„ÄÇ

4 million because that's the exact population of the US military„ÄÇ

 The power of long termm loyalty in a group setting„ÄÇ a KÔºå a tribe works for a couple of reasons„ÄÇ

 Numb oneÔºå because of a specialization of labor„ÄÇ So one person is good at one thing„ÄÇ

 another person is good at another thing And the cost of them working on the thing that theyre particularly good at isn't even really that much„ÄÇ

 Because they're already an expert on itÔºå And they can focus all of their time on that specialization and that thing that they know very„ÄÇ

 very wellÔºå rather than let's sayÔºå focusing likeÔºå ohÔºå how do I get medical care„ÄÇ

 How do I feed myself„ÄÇ How do I do thisÔºå How do I do thatÔºå They can just focus on their specialty„ÄÇ

 Another reasonÔºå economy of scale„ÄÇ It's cheaper per person to provide a service in bulk„ÄÇ

 This is actually why elephants survive longer than squirrels„ÄÇ

 because as you grow something takes less energy for that thing to survive than if you are to have a very small thing where each little function is taking„ÄÇ

AMa amount of energy„ÄÇ LastlyÔºå it works because of shared goals„ÄÇ If a group has a shared goal„ÄÇ WellÔºå1„ÄÇ

4 million people having a shared goal is muchÔºå much more impactful than one person having a shared goal„ÄÇ

 ObviouslyÔºå How is this relevant to women WellÔºå think about why does the girl care about how social and popular you are rather than how strong you are„ÄÇ

 Why are women attracted to men in uniform„ÄÇ WellÔºå if you think about itÔºå if you are surrounded by„ÄÇ

 let's say five guys who all want to fight you„ÄÇ no matter how strong you are„ÄÇ

 you're probably gonna lose that fight„ÄÇ becauseÔºå you knowÔºå some guy can sneak up behind you„ÄÇ

 some guy can hit you while another guys hitting youÔºå it just becomes overwhelming„ÄÇ

 five guys will almost always in any realistic situationÔºå beat one guy„ÄÇ

 no matter what you see in the movies„ÄÇ So being able to recruit people onto your team is a much„ÄÇ

 much better skill for survival than being strongÔºå ever will be„ÄÇ

 and being part of a powerful group is a much bigger aphrodiia act than let's say just be„ÄÇ

Super strong or super smart on your own it's why women love guys in army uniforms„ÄÇ

 even though it's kind of stupid„ÄÇSo when you build this tribe for yourself„ÄÇ

 if everyone has their own specialtyÔºå you all have shared goalsÔºå etc ce„ÄÇ

 it allows all of these advantages to come into your life that you probably not even thinking about„ÄÇ

 So what are these advantagesÔºå I'm going name them off and then I'm gonna give you a specific example of how this is affected my life and what sort of things our tribe has brought to me number one„ÄÇ

 you get to focus entirely on your specific skill So let's say that you're a lawyer and then you're the lawyer guy from the tribe Well you can only focus on being a lawyer if any of your friends need legal advice„ÄÇ

 you can give that to themÔºå it's probably a pretty marginal cost for you to give them legal advice and you don't have to worry about okay how do I deal with this„ÄÇ

 how do I deal with that they can you have the doctor friend that can give you medical care You have the business friend that can give you business advice„ÄÇ

 you have the accountant friend that can give you tax advice I have a friend that is a personal trainer It would cost me hundreds and hundreds of dollars for me to go hire a personal trainer but he does it for free because I have given him value as well and because he's just part„ÄÇ

The tribe„ÄÇ He's the personal trainer guy in the tribe„ÄÇ

 And I myself am able to focus entirely on my profession and then just give that sort of advice and value to the rest of the guys in the tribe„ÄÇ

 Number twoÔºå you gain perks that you wouldn't have otherwise„ÄÇ

 I'm actually currently staying in a free hotel with one of the guys that is part of our tribe He's an awesome„ÄÇ

 awesome guy„ÄÇ really great guy in the hospitality business and he offered to let us stay here for free because you know„ÄÇ

 we've done him other favors and he's learned a lot from us as well„ÄÇ number three„ÄÇ

 you get into events that you wouldn't be able to get into„ÄÇ

 you obviously provide a few of those events yourself„ÄÇ

 like maybe you just have access to some awesome events and then you can take 10 people that say but you're not having to provide all of the events„ÄÇ

 So we talked a bit about building that adventure„ÄÇ Well„ÄÇ

 a lot of those events that I go to are from friends„ÄÇ

 And then maybe I just might have one event that I can get into and then I provide that to my friends„ÄÇ

 actually have two friends that own a charity and they have this big charity gala every single year„ÄÇ

 and I get to go to that„ÄÇ One of my friends has„ÄÇüòäÔºåAccess to the Maxim Halloween party every year„ÄÇ

 And we get to go to that 4Ôºå you get to develop projects that wouldn't otherwise be possible„ÄÇ

 Think about real social dynamics without them building the tribe that they have„ÄÇ

 We wouldn't have a platform to give you guys this information„ÄÇ

 and something that we're very proud of„ÄÇ N 5Ôºå being able to meet girls that you wouldn't otherwise„ÄÇ

 actuallyÔºå have a friend that brought a girl to a partyÔºå I think three months back„ÄÇ

 and he had talked me up and talked me up and talked me up„ÄÇ And up hookking up with that girl„ÄÇ

 is a lot of fun„ÄÇ And that never would have met that girl„ÄÇ if he hadn't been a part of the tribe„ÄÇ

 And if I hadn't done that for him and a previous encounter 6Ôºå permeation of personality traits„ÄÇ

 My two friends and two of my best wingmenÔºå Graham and Michael„ÄÇ

 who you are going to hear later in this program„ÄÇ They're both extremely extremely fun guys„ÄÇ

 They're both very happy„ÄÇ They have a lot of energy„ÄÇ They're always in a good mood„ÄÇ They're very fun„ÄÇ

 And from themÔºå I've just noticed that I am more happy and I am more fun just by being around them„ÄÇ

 And for meÔºå they've probably learned more about cognitive think„ÄÇüòä„ÄÇ

In problem solving and how to actually do math problems„ÄÇNumber 7„ÄÇ

 permeation of habits to that personal trainer guy is in reallyÔºå really good shape„ÄÇ Well„ÄÇ

 when I'm around himÔºå even though I'm in somewhat good shapeÔºå I feel like I'm in terrible shape„ÄÇ

 because I'm comparing myself to him„ÄÇ and I see those habits that he is doing„ÄÇ

 When Brandon Carter is around„ÄÇ I feel massively out of shape„ÄÇ

 because I see how far he's been able to take it in that particular habit„ÄÇ

 And so there's that kind of permeation of me thinkingÔºå oh„ÄÇ

 I really need to try harder on this habit and I just start doing it naturally„ÄÇ Number 8„ÄÇ

 permeation of knowledge„ÄÇ I've learned a ton a ton about business from Dererick„ÄÇ

 I've learned about hospitality„ÄÇ You knowÔºå I've learned about any number of subjects„ÄÇ

 Basically that knowledge„ÄÇ I didn't even have to ask them„ÄÇ

 It's sort of just permeated my being because I'm just hearing it all the time„ÄÇ

 And sometimes I do ask them„ÄÇ and I get very specific answers about where I need to go next in those fields„ÄÇ

 LastlyÔºå I get a lot of feedback that I would not be able to get anywhere else„ÄÇ And This is very„ÄÇ

 very important„ÄÇ I read an article recently that„ÄÇillustratellustrated a point that I've thought about for a long time„ÄÇ

 which is that everyone has blind spots and everyone kind of has their thing„ÄÇ

 their quote unquote thing that all their friends can see in them that they can't„ÄÇ

 at least in our tribe since we're so honest with each other„ÄÇ

 we are constantly telling each other are blind spots„ÄÇ

 And so instead of having to go 30 years with that blind spot where it would hurt me and now get that eliminated pretty much immediately„ÄÇ

 And obviously we're not critical about this„ÄÇ it's productive feedback„ÄÇ

 but they know that I will be completely open to them giving me honest feedback to pointing out my blind spots and that they will be open to me doing the same„ÄÇ

 NextÔºå how to build this tribe„ÄÇ So was the difference between a tribe and a social circle because I already kind of win over how to build a social circle„ÄÇ

 WellÔºå this is your inner core of the social circle„ÄÇ and it consists of dudes that are killing it„ÄÇ

 So you might have a lot of friends that they're great for a party„ÄÇ

 they're great to just hang out with or part of your social circle„ÄÇ

 but maybe you just don't trust them that muchÔºå maybe„ÄÇ

You don't wantan to be around them all the time because you'll pick up on their bad habits Well tribe is the real core there guys that are just absolutely killing it doing very„ÄÇ

 very well in every area and that you trust to be absolute ht so that you guys can all be on the same page and have those shared goals This is also the part of your tribe that you go on the most adventures with so we' go to different countries„ÄÇ

 different continents all over the place and we trust each other and we know that we have similar tastes so we're able to have those adventures together and make them more fun for everyone So honestly I think this concept of building a tribe is very simple„ÄÇ

 I'm not even going to get into a lot of complex stuff because it really isn't all that complicated the best way to do this is to become intensely good at something so intensely good at something that people would be crazy to not want to be around you because you know that specialty so well you know it's so well that people would be gaining so much value just from being around you and being able to pick up on those things that they know„ÄÇ

It would benefit their lives immensely everyone in our tribe is doing this and so we've naturally gravitated towards each other The other part is just having a really fun and non-supplicating personality So none of us are like kissing each other's ass we all have a ton of fun we have very loud„ÄÇ

 very boisterous very fun personalityities we have good senses of humor and so because we each have that and in our little town or local area we're kind of that guy„ÄÇ

 we naturally gravitate towards each other and then want to hang out with each other because we can't find anyone else who's like that in our original environments So if you can develop that fun personality and develop that specialty you will naturally start gravitating towards other people who are like that we're just really„ÄÇ

 really fucking good at something and they have an amazing personality that just sort of blow everyone else out of the water and you will start building that tribe naturally this also means building your own adventure which we already talked about but by building your own adventure you can start inviting„ÄÇ

Those people to exclusive events„ÄÇ So let's say you have a yacht party that you just happen to have access to you can start inviting like the really„ÄÇ

 really fun guy that you trust a lot and who's reallyÔºå really good at something„ÄÇ it'll come„ÄÇ

 you guys will have fun together and you'll be able to have that permeation of knowledge permeation of habits and then you'll naturally gravitate other people towards that group and before you know it„ÄÇ

 you have 10 guys who are all like that we're all going to crazyÔºå awesome events„ÄÇ

 ideally these are people that have bond to the same core values so that everyone is on the same page„ÄÇ

 if someone just isn't trustworthy or if someone is selfish„ÄÇ

 doesn't want to put the tribes goals before their own you really can't have that person„ÄÇ

 and if you start letting a few of those people in well„ÄÇ

 then eventually the tribes just gonna collapse or' gonna be some drama and you're gonna have to start all over again„ÄÇ

 you want the initial group so maybe the first three of you first four of you to be set on the rules and then you want the newcomers to be apprised of the rules very quickly so you want kind of a„ÄÇ

Shared sense of values that you guys talk about explicitly„ÄÇ

 And then when you have new people coming inÔºå you convey those rules to them and say look we're a tight knit group„ÄÇ

 maybe we want you to be a part of the group„ÄÇ However„ÄÇ

 we all treat each other in this this and this way we all do things in this this and this way So if you want to be a part of this if you want to come on our adventures etc you have to follow those rules as well and it should be something that they do naturally like you don't want to bring a liar in and be like hey man I know you're a liar know just for now can you be honest it should be people where these values come out naturally but they should also be apprised of these rules explicitly you then want to start having a free flow of work of favors of working on projects of ideas of habits so that you guys are all getting all those advantages that we talked about and having everyone get the benefits from everyone else in the tribe and this is what creates like everyone becoming more and more of that killing it personality more and more of that success„ÄÇ

Your success builds off theirsÔºå their success builds off yours„ÄÇ you guys work on projects together„ÄÇ

 you do all of those advantages and eventually you guys are just so far ahead of everyone else that it would be insane for let's say a new guy who's killing it to not want to be a part of your group You're also able to work on projects that make the tribe better as a whole So let's say you guys want to rent out a space that you guys just have for parties something that can make everyone's life better let's say that you guys all want to learn a skill well maybe you could hire an instructor to teach all of you guys at the same time like a jujisu instructor there's tons of different projects that you guys can then build together that make everyone's life better and they are specific to the tribe So what does this mean for game well obviously wingmanship the best interview available is the one created by Derek and Ryan on this topic which you can find at RSD Dererick co for free However„ÄÇ

 I'm just gonna go over some quick wingmanship caveats that are relevant to this program and to what we're talking about in this commandment What do you want to look for„ÄÇ

winging WellÔºå the main thing is that the person just has potential and what does potential mean It's someone you can have fun with„ÄÇ

 It's someone who has a good cognitive ability to be able to actually read what is happening you'll want to be out with an idiot„ÄÇ

 someone that will do what's best for you So if you wing him„ÄÇ

 let's say that you're talking to a girl you're not attracted to but you wing him all night then the next time he's gonna do that for you„ÄÇ

 This actually has the effect of you guys getting more girls because it pretty much assures that one of you is gonna get a girl every single night that you guys are out What I also mean by doing what's best for you is doing what's best for you in the long term„ÄÇ

 So I have a friend who is telling me about his wing and how his wing was telling him„ÄÇ

 you're just gonna get demoralizedÔºå you know when you keep doing this stuff because this game is just so demoralizing and like you might be happy now but you're not gonna be happy later when all these girls reject you And I told him you should get rid of this guy immediately it's completely negative attitude just bring„ÄÇ

Bllshit to your life„ÄÇ and you don't even want to wing men like that„ÄÇ Lastly„ÄÇ

 you want someone who actually approaches right you don't want to be with the guy who's likeÔºå oh no„ÄÇ

 I can't do that tonight because you know I'm too cool and and tonight„ÄÇ

 you know I'm just gonna watch you do this or just someone who's just not even gonna be in this in the long term„ÄÇ

 So they're like really excited about it for a month but then they go on to the next project that they're not gonna complete either you want someone who has long termm thinking is gonna be in this for a long time and who is actively working on this So just some basic rules the guy that approaches chooses which girl he wants So don't come in and start hitting on your buddies girl just go to the other girl one thing that I think is is pretty misunderstood is accomplishment intros„ÄÇ

 these things can often come off as hokey because the guy will come in be like this guy changed my life and he's so great in this this and this way„ÄÇ

 you want to add a little bit of subtlety to this right so start talking to the girl first get a little bit into the conversation and then you start adding in one ops about like oh yeah like this person's a dentist Oh yeah like this person change my life in this way„ÄÇ

 don't like march„ÄÇAnd just start like reciting things that are good about this guy„ÄÇ

 You have to do it in a way that is socially intelligent„ÄÇ

 If you guys decide that you want to switch girlsÔºå this actually happens a lot because one girl might be more attuned to your personality„ÄÇ

 one might be more attuned to your wing's personality but you just happen to be talking to the wrong girls and you can tell okay if we switch girls this is actually gonna work you should have some sort of like signal and way of communicating that to your wing it's something that does come up but just have a way of talking to your wing or at least signaling to your wing that that would be an option„ÄÇ

 Another common mistake that I see with guys with wingmanship they talk down to or contradict their wing„ÄÇ

 So they'll say something like oh yeah my asshole friends or like oh I hope this guy's not giving you a hard time„ÄÇ

 He kind does that„ÄÇ It's like great dude„ÄÇ you just framed your friends as a fucking loser what does that make you that make you for hanging out with a loser„ÄÇ

 Now your friends of a loser congratulations asshole Another thing we talked a lot about logistics and problem solving Well one of the parts of learning with your wing is learning how to solve„ÄÇ

logisticistics togetherÔºå me and MichaelÔºå I thinkÔºå have pulled to the same room„ÄÇ

 And I mean that as in we're both sleeping with both girls in the same room„ÄÇ

 something like six timesÔºå we've also had many situations where he pulls to the room first„ÄÇ

 I pull to the room secondÔºå and then we have to coordinate thatÔºü So we have to get a sense ofÔºå okay„ÄÇ

 what are our collective logisticsÔºå Is this the sort of situation„ÄÇ

 where both of us can go there at the same timeÔºå Is he going go firstÔºå Am I going to go first„ÄÇ

 How is that going to affect the interactionÔºå What kind of factors do we have to deal with„ÄÇ

 You want to start talking about this stuff with your buddy so that you can get a sense of how their mind works„ÄÇ

 and how you can solve those problems in the future„ÄÇLastly„ÄÇ

 you guys need to be open to feedback with each other„ÄÇ

 This doesn't mean criticizing each other in the club about different things that happened„ÄÇ

 What it means isÔºå okayÔºå I notice you did this when I did this and this affected my interaction in a certain way„ÄÇ

 I did thisÔºå which affected your interaction„ÄÇ So in the futureÔºå we need to do thisÔºå this and this„ÄÇ

 Always be open to feedback„ÄÇ Always be open to feedback„ÄÇ because otherwise„ÄÇ

 you guys are just going to make the same collective mistakes over and over„ÄÇ

 And those are often specific to you and himÔºå rather than mistakes that you're just making in your game„ÄÇ

 So you might never hear about itÔºå if you guys don't talk about it„ÄÇ Book recommendation Guns„ÄÇ

 germs and steel by Jared Diamond„ÄÇExerciseÔºå write down a list of your 10 closest friends„ÄÇ

 Write down a list of something you can do for their lives that they can't„ÄÇ

Go do those things in the next 30 days„ÄÇ‰πüÊòØ„ÄÇ
