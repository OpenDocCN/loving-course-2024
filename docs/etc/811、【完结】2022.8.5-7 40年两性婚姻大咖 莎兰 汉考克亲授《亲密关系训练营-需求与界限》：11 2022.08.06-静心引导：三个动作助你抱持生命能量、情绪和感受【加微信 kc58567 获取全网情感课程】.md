 you can do them by yourself。At home， on the subway， any time you need them， they calm you down。

 they give you grounding they put you in a good space。那进行练习呢，我们可以在家里面坐，在地铁上坐，随时随地都可以坐。

它能够让我们进入到一个非常平静的能量状态。 So first of all， I would like to show them to you。

 Then we're going to put on music， and I will guide you through a process of using these hand positions。

 This is the first one。 fingeringtips lightly touching seat。那这是angle我们的第一个动作，像是一个三角形，非常轻柔的食指的指尖相触。

 and then you take your hands in this triangle and you put them in your lap。然后带着这样的一个手型啊，放在你的腿上。

And what these exercises do is they relax the right side and the left side of your brain so you really calm down这个练能够同时放松你的左右脑让 you进入到一个平静的状态里 Frankangle with your hands and in your lap so this youre relaxed in your shoulders。

这样的一个十指相触的手型，三角形放到大腿上，肩膀放松向下沉。And when you do that， you're going to breathe very slowly like this。

非常缓慢的呼吸。像这样。Okay that we did yesterday， so that's our first position our second position watch is you hold up your right hand and you take these three fingers and you put them on this part of your right hand。

 you see？那么这个呼吸昨天已经学过了啊，ba。Here。首先呢我们让左手啊伸出中间的三根手指，然后放到右手的这个部位。

 right hand up left hand on right hand and you hold your hands。左手放到右手上，然后这样放到大腿上一样的。

And it's very beautiful， it lets you connect to your heart and to your tanian they balance your heart and your belly。

这是一个非常美好的姿势它能够去平衡你的心灵和丹田。It's really good then we change it you hold your left hand you take your right hand you do the same thing on the other side so we balance the two sides now然后我们再做相反的一测啊现在是右手放在左手上右手的三根手指放在左手上 and what happens is you balance yin and yang it's really nice it's very it's like how you give to yourself it's a way that you give love and attention to yourself。
