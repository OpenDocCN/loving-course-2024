然后我说。暴力主要出现在男性之中。So I like to go around the circle and ask all the men how they control their violence。

然后呢，我就喜欢让在场的人逐一的谈一谈，当他们内心出现暴力倾向、暴力冲动的时候，他是怎么去控制调节的？And so explain to the violent husband。

How they can do it and how he can do it。于是呢他们可以向那个有暴力的丈夫来解释一下，说一说她可以怎么样去应对他嗯自己是怎么应对的。And also。

 explain to the violent half husband what the consequence will be if he's ever violent again to his wife。

同时也向这位施暴的丈夫说明一下，如果未来他再次向妻子施暴的话，他要承受什么样的后果。So I help the family take power and take responsibility about violence in the family。

所以我会帮助这个家庭这嗯对于怎样负起防止暴力嗯，预防暴力，怎么样承担责任方面去工作。Because this is very therapeutic because it's much worse when the government has to take control of the violence。

因为以这样的方式来控制暴力，比最后不得不要政府介入来控制家暴要好得多。Because then the violent husbandman goes to jail。因为等到要政府介入的时候。

施暴的丈夫就得要进进监狱了。 and this is quite as a very best you want to prevent。啊，这也是身为一个治疗师想要预防的局面。

So I will give you some my favorite strategies for working with couples。嗯，我再跟大家讲一讲，我跟夫妻一起进行治疗的时候。

最喜欢用的几个策略。1 is what I call creating a boundary around the couple。其中一个我称之为在夫妻之间哦，不在夫妻的周围创造一个边界。

So the couple can feel that they are a unit separate from the parents。于是呢这对夫妻可以感觉到他们两个人是一个单元。

他们和各自的父母是分离的。So one thing I like to do is send the young couple to visit the parents。所以有一个我喜欢用的做法。

就是请一对年轻的夫妻去看望自己的父母。And I will tell the wife said， in this visit。I want her to be hugging her husband。

 all the time。然后我会跟年轻的妻子说，你俩去看望父母的时候，你要经常去拥抱你的丈夫。Maybe kissing him， caressing his scared。是可以亲吻一下丈夫。

抚摸一下丈夫的头发。Whirisspering， I can here。在丈夫的耳边悄悄说话。Until the parents get uncomfortable and say， go home。

直到父母都看不下去了，说你俩赶紧回家吧。So this establishes we have a relationship together that has nothing to do with you。

所以通过这样的方式来树立起建立起一个边界。说明我们两个人之间已经建立好了关系，我们的关系跟你们没有关系。

Another strategy is blocking cross generation coalitions。另外一个策略叫做阻断跨代联盟。

So a typical problem is that a husband is very close to his mother。有一个非常典型的问题，就是丈夫和自己的母亲非常的亲近。

And the wife resents this。而妻子因此而感到怨恨。So I say to the husband。

 I want you to call your mother on the phone。那么我就会对丈夫说，我想要请你给你的母亲打个电话。In front of your wife。当着妻子的面。

And I want you to tell your mother how much you love your wife。我想让你告诉母亲，你多么的爱自己的妻子。

That you're so happy that you married her。能够娶到这样一个女人，你觉得非常的幸福。😊。

That she is the best woman in the world， and you adore her。她是全世界最好的女人，你很爱这个妻子。

And just listen to your mother's response。然后呢，听一听妈妈的回应。

But this is very important to establish a boundary。 I'm married now。 I'm your son。

 but my wife is more important。以这样的方式来建立起一条非常重要的界限，就是我现在已经结婚了，我是你的儿子。但同时我现在也是另外一个人的丈夫了。

So this has to do with clarifying loyalties。这个就是澄清清晰的定义忠诚有关。

Because the wedding ceremony means that you transfer your primary loyalty。

From your parents to your wife or your husband。因为婚礼的意义就在于界定了从这一刻开始，你的忠诚从原先对父母首要忠诚于父母转移到了现在首要忠诚的对象是伴侣。

But many people go through the wedding ceremony and never make that transfer。但是呢很多人虽然经过了婚礼。

但是一直都没能完成这样的过渡。So as a therapist， you have to help them to make that transfer。所以作为治疗师呢。

你就要帮助他们去做这样的转变。Another crucial， important strategy。Is to help people。

 to always attribute good intentions。另外一个至关重要的策略就是帮助人们在做归因的时候，始终去做善意的归因。So many people think， oh。

 my husband or my wife， they said that with a bad intention。 They have bad intentions towards me。

因为有那么多的人都是觉得我的丈夫，我的妻子，他之所以当时对我说那样的一番话，是因为他对我怀有恶意。It's important to help them to think the intention was good。

所，很重要的是要帮他们这样去思考。意图是好的，是善意的。Maybe the words were not right。 maybe the actions were not right。

 but the intention was a good intention。也许他当时的用词不太合适，也许他的做法并不正确，但是他的意图是好的，本意是好的。一。

So this is a crucial one。 Another one that is important is what I call the statute of limitations。嗯。

所以这个很重要。另外一个我也认为很重要的，我称之为追溯时效。嗯。In most societies。There is a law that if a crime was not processed for seven years。

 it's forgotten。在大部分的社会呢都会存在着这样一条法律。就是当某一项犯罪在几年的时间当中没有被绳之以法。那么过了一定的年数之后，这一个犯罪就要失去追诉的时效。

I don't know how it is in China， maybe it's seven years or10 years。

 but there's a number of years after which you do not process a crime。我不知道在中国有没有这样的规定，这个时项是7年还是10年。

但是呢。其嗯精髓就是经过几年之后，我们就不再追溯了。So in the United States， is seven years。所以在美国呢，这个时间是7年。

So unless it's a sexual crime， sexual crime doesn't have limitations。

 but unless it's sexual crime after seven years， it's regarded。除非是性犯罪，性犯罪不是不设追诉时效，其他的犯罪7年之后就不再不再追诉了。

So I like to say this rule should I apply to marriage。所以我想表达的是，这条规定也应该适用于婚姻。So， you know。

 when couples begin to argue， they usually remember something bad that happened in the past。

 It's usually the wife that brings up something from the past。你们都知道，当一对夫妻开始争吵的时候。

他们往往比较容易回想起过往发生的一些不太好的事情。且通常呢可能是妻子会提起过去发生的一些不好的事。So they say， I remember when you did this。

 when you said this to my mother， when you did this other thing that might have been 20 years ago。

他可能会说我还记得某个时候你对我说了什么，当时你对我的妈妈说了什么，尽管这些事情可能已经过去20年了。So I say when you begin to argue。

 you have to stop and think， was this more than seven years ago， if it was more than seven years ago。

 you cannot talk about it。所以我喜欢对他们说，在你开始争吵之前，你首先要想一想我接下来要提的这件事情有没有超过7年。如果已经超过7年了，甚至已经超过20年了，那我就不能再提了。

So this stops many fights。 We have to， they have to stop and think， when was this 7 years ago。

10 years ago， five years ago。你刚碰的不得不先停下来想一想这件事是什么时候发生的。7年前、5年前还是10年前。那么通过这样停下来思考，就可以停下很多无谓的争吵。

So the couple typically decides， let's not talk about the past let's not fight about the past at all。

于是呢往往这对夫妻就会得出一个大家都同意的结论。我们干脆任何发生在过去的事情都不要吵了，都放下吧。Because it's too boring to think， when was this。

因为还要去停下来想，这到底是哪一年发生的，太无聊了。So I'll tell you about a favorite strategy of mine that I call creating good memories。

好，接下来我跟你们讲一个我自己最喜欢的策略，叫做创造好的回忆。😊，And I'll tell you the story about a specific couple when I first used this strategy。

我给你们讲一个，我最初使用这套策略的时候遇到的一对夫妻。So I was the supervisor behind a one way in the era。当时呢我是一个督导。

坐在嗯治疗室隔壁的单面镜的后面。I had a group of students with me and a therapist was working with a couple on the other side of the mirror。

哎，和我一起坐在这面单面镜后面呢，还有我的一些学生治疗师呢就在隔壁房间和他的家庭一起工作。And this was a couple that came with a very serious problem。

当时那对夫妻来的时候有一个很严重的问题。The wife was diabetic and she was completely neglecting her diabetes。那个妻子患有糖尿病。

而且他对自己的病情处以一种完全忽视的态度在对待。She was not taking her。 blood she was not taking her insulin。他既不厌血糖。

也不注射注射那叫啥来着？胰岛素。And she was drinking a half bottle of vodka every night。而且每天晚上他都要喝掉半瓶伏特加。

And she said that she had to drink the vodka because of the bad relationship with her husband。

他说自己不得不喝那瓶伏特加，因为她跟丈夫的关系不好。The husband was a big， tall man。丈夫是一个个子很大很高的男人。😊，He wasn't really violent。

 but he had a bad temper。上夫并没有暴力的行为，但是脾气不太好。So they would be having dinner as something would upset him。

 and he would smash a plate of food against the wall。所以可能他们正吃着晚饭呢，然后丈夫因为某件事情心情变得不好，她就会把一盘子的食物砸到墙上。

She was a big woman， also。妻子也是一个大个子的女性。And they had two children。看来有两个两个孩子。

So the therapist was a very proper young man， always dressed in a suit when a die。

他们的治疗师是一个穿着非常得体的年轻男性，总是穿着西装打着领带。He was a doctoral student。他是正在读博士学位的一个学生。

And the couple would come to every session。And fight about。Trivial things。这对夫妻每次治疗都来，然后在治疗当中呢。

因为一些小事儿争吵。Like， who would take out the garbage， Who would take care of the dog。比如说垃圾要谁拿出去扔，总要由谁来照顾。

And after towards， recessions like this。The couple was not getting， not getting any better。

经过两三次这样的治疗之后，夫妻并没有好转的迹象。But the therapist was getting more and more depressed。但是治疗师显然越来越抑郁了。

A good job the therapist was thinking， for this， I went through a doctor of a program。😊，我能够看出来。

治疗师心里在想这样的治疗案例，我是通不过博士论文的。So I called the therapist out of the room and I said。

 we have to do something different。于是呢我就请这位博士生治疗师出来，我跟他说，我们得要换一种做法。And in the American culture。

 there's a very famous novel and movie that is called Gone with the Win。在美国文化当中，有一部非常出名的电影叫做漂乱世佳人。

It's a very romantic movie， and it's four hours long。😊，是一部非常浪漫的电影，而且很长4个小时。And is based on a novel。

 That is this thing。这部影片是基于这么厚的一本小说改编的。And so I said， I want you to say to the wife。

That as you talk to her and her husband， you are so reminded of this movie， gone with a wind。对我对治疗师说。

我希望你回去治疗室之后，你对这对夫妻这样讲，你说我一边在跟你们聊天对话，一边忍不住你们俩让我回想起了曾经看过的一部很浪漫的电影，乱世佳人。

Because she remindmands you of Scarlet。 Scarlet was the woman in the movie。因为妻子让你想起了电影当中的女主角斯嘉丽。

And her husband reminds you of red the man and the movie。那这位丈夫呢让你想起了电影当中的rick男主角。Right，Yeah， and。

Scarlet was always going to change Ken。 She was going to change red。在电影当中呢，斯嘉丽总是在试图改变瑞。But。

 she never changed it。嗯嗯从来都没有成功过，没能改变他。And what we didn't know was this woman was an expert in that movie and that novelural。

那个时候的我们还不知道，当时的那位妻子对这部电影了如指掌，小说也非常的了解。And she said。

 I watched the movie many times and Scarlet changed him。所他说那部电影我看过好多次。斯嘉丽确实改变了rick。

The husband whose only resemblance to the actor was in the movie was that he had a mustache。

而丈夫呢唯一记得的就是电影里的男主角是长胡子的。Began to turn his moustache， looking at himself in the mirror。嗯。😊，于是。

丈夫也开始看着镜子，开始粘起了自己的小胡子。😊，She liked a comparison with the actor。他很喜欢治疗师把自己和男明星做比较。So she said， no。

 that's not true。 Scarlet changed him。这是说你说的不对，史佳丽后来改变了rick。And the therapist said。

 I bet youre $20 that you read the book again and you're not going to find one sentence that shows that you change it。

张师兄，我跟你赌20美金，你回去再看一遍那本小说，你找不出任何一句句子，说明他改变了瑞。And she said， all right， God take the bed，$20。记得说好的。

我跟你赌20美金。So the therapist said， so I'm surprised that you think that you can change your husband instead of enjoying his passionate temperament。

这要是说我很惊讶惊讶的看到，惊讶于你以为自己可以改变自己的丈夫，而不是就去享受这样一个充满激情的丈夫，这样的一个暴脾气的丈夫。

But the point of this was the elevation strategy。而这个策略当中的精髓就在于抬高。By talking about this。

 we had elevated the couple to the highest romantic level in the United States culture。通过那样的对话。

智郎师把这对夫妻抬高到了美国文化当中最浪漫的一对夫妻的代表的那个层面。They were no longer a couple fighting about the garbage and the dog。

They were similar to the most romantic story in the culture of the United States。于是呢他们就不再只是一对因为扔垃圾。

因为照顾狗的事情而在争吵的夫妻，而是和美国文化当中最浪漫的典型的那一对夫妻很相像的一对夫妻。So this is a very important strategy to elevate people to their highest possible self。

也这是一个非常重要的策略策略，就是把人抬高到他有可能成为的最好的自己。So then， the therapist said。I would like you to tell me。

 what are the best memories of your life together。😊，然后这要师说，我想请你们跟我讲一讲你们共同的生活当中最美好的一些回忆。

It could be something when you first met， it could be in the honeymoon。It could be at any time。

 What are your best memories together。😊，有可能是你们俩刚刚认识的时候，有可能是你们在度蜜月的时候，你们俩相处的时光当中，最美好的回忆有一些什么？

And at first， they said no good memories would always fought with each other。那么一开始说没有什么好的回应，我俩总是吵架。

So I called the therapist on the intercom， and I said， just tell them to be silent and think。

 and they will remember。于是呢我就打那线电话去治疗室，跟这个治疗师说，你跟这对夫妻讲，让他们安静下来，花一些时间想一想。

So they S in silence for a few minutes， and then the husband said， I remember something。

于是呢他们就沉默了几分钟回忆。接着丈夫说，我想起一件事儿。And they had gone to the state of Florida for their honeymoon。

当时他们他们的命运是去佛罗里达州度的。And one evening， the husband went for a walk by himself。有天晚上，丈夫独自出门散步。

And there was a lagoon with dolphins。当时呢散步的路边有有一个湖湖里面有。海豚。

And a trainer was practicing with the dolphins。日湖吧海，然后当时的那个驯兽师呢正在海边训练这群海豚。

So the husband learned the signs that the trainer gave to the dolphins。于是啊，丈夫就在旁边学会了训练师用来训海豚的那些手势信号。

And the next evening， he invited the wife for a walk， they went to the lagoon。

 and he gave the signs to the dolphins。也是第二天晚上，他就邀请妻子跟他一起出门散步。他们来到海边，他给海里的那些海豚发信号。

And the dolphins began to jump out of the water and put on a show just for her。于是呢，海豚们就开始跃出水面。

给妻子做了一场表演。So， that was a wonderful memory。对，那是一个很棒的回忆。

And then she remembered something else that the husband had done when their first child was born。然后呢。

妻子也想了起来，当他们的第一个孩子出生的时候，丈夫为她做过一些什么？So now they have two good memory。现在他们只有两段很美好的回忆了。So from then on。

 we said。We are going to meet every two weeks。And every two weeks， you have to create a good memory。

😊，接下来呢我们对他们说，嗯之后的治疗，我们每每隔两周见一次。在这两周的时间里面，你们得要去创造一个美好的记忆。

It can be something just between the two of you or with the children。这可以是你们两个人一起的，也可以是带上孩子一起的。

It doesn't have to cost any money， but it has to be something special that you will always remember。

不见得要花什么钱，但是得要是一些很特别的，你们总会记得的事儿。So they came every two weeks， reported on what they had done。

于是呢他们接下来就两周来一次报告一下他们做了一些什么。And plant a new memory that they would create。😊，在计划接下来他们想要一起创造什么样的记忆？

And after three or four months。Her diabetes was under control。

 She wasn't drinking because the relationship with husband had changed。这几个月之后呢，妻子就不再酗酒了。

他也开始照顾自己的糖尿病了，因为丈夫已经完全改变了。We never talked about the diabetes。

 we never talked about the drinking care。我们从来没有跟他们去讨论糖尿病的问题，酗酒的问题。Just about creating good memories。

全都是围绕着怎么创造美好的回忆。So we ended the therapy， they said they wanted the children to meet the therapist。

所在我们结束治疗的时候，他们说他们想要孩子来见见这位治疗师。So the therapist met their children。所以智疗师呢就去见了这个孩子。

So this is a wonderful track strategy that we all should live by。

 we should all create good memories on a regular basis。Something that we can always treasure。所以。

这是一个我们每个人都可以把它作为生活当中去一指的原则的一条策略。每个人都应该在生活当中更多的去创造美好的回忆。于是我们每个人的生命当中都有越来越多值得去珍惜的东西。
