Commandment 4Ôºå thou shalt discern the logistics and social dynamics of the interaction„ÄÇ

Logal management is about dealing with the social matrix and the mine field that exists between you„ÄÇ

 your girl and the pool location„ÄÇIf I had a magic wine and I could magically give myself perfect game or perfect logistics„ÄÇ

üòäÔºåI would 100% of the timeÔºå pick perfect logistics„ÄÇ

Why as fun as it would be to get all of the women around me emotionally aroused„ÄÇ

I would rather have all of my ideal girls be lined up in the same area with nothing to do„ÄÇ

 Their phones are fully charged„ÄÇ All their friends and family are in a temporary coma„ÄÇ

 and no other creepy guys are near by„ÄÇI'll end up closing one of themÔºå maybe two„ÄÇ

As much as logistics is about understanding how to effectively manage the elements between meeting the girl and the poor location„ÄÇ

 it is also about how to find the right girl and understand compatibility of lifestyle„ÄÇ

It is about finding out if she is the companion you to find in the three sacred questions exercise„ÄÇ

 That beingÔºå who is the ideal companion for the life you want to live„ÄÇ

A guy who has been talking to girls consistently is almost an autopilot„ÄÇ

 The words are just falling out of his mouth because he is completely in the flow and completely trusting of his instincts„ÄÇ

All of his mental bandwidth is consistently focused on handling logistics„ÄÇ

We concern ourselves with logistics because time is limited„ÄÇ time is limited„ÄÇ

 and leaving you rapidly„ÄÇEveryone is under the illusion that death happens at the end of your life„ÄÇ

 but death is constantly happening as you leave one moment after the next one second at a time„ÄÇ

 leaving it for the great beyond„ÄÇTime is your most valuable resource„ÄÇ

Deerk would often ask if he would rather trade places with Warren Buffett at his ripe age of 89 years old„ÄÇ

 but his net worth of $67„ÄÇ7 billion„ÄÇNowÔºå that's a lot of moneyÔºå but time is very limited„ÄÇ

Most people would not make that trade„ÄÇWhat do you think Warren would pay to trade places with you„ÄÇ

LikelyÔºå he would trade everything he ownsÔºå his whole net worth„ÄÇEverything he could borrow„ÄÇ

And maybe anything he could steal as well„ÄÇHe would give everything to have several decades of his time back„ÄÇ

 It is simply your most valuable resource„ÄÇAlthough you are not able to purchase more time directly„ÄÇ

 you are able to make better use of the time allotted to you„ÄÇ

You make it more efficient by using your intellectual and social resources„ÄÇ

Someone who can develop a highly specialized skill set and then connect with others who have developed highly specialized skill sets„ÄÇ

 that person can make quite an income and use that money to make space for his freedom„ÄÇLikewise„ÄÇ

 someone who can most effectively utilize their intellectual and social resources in the nightclub can find sexual partners quite frequently„ÄÇ

Of all places in the world where sex is most abundant in the shortest period of time„ÄÇ

 nightclubs provide the best possible environment„ÄÇCoincidentally„ÄÇ

 this is also one of the most intimidating environments as well„ÄÇIf it was easyÔºå everyone would do it„ÄÇ

 So be grateful that it is difficult„ÄÇ The tougher the playgroundÔºå the stronger you get inside„ÄÇ

During the day timeÔºå although there are many less obstacles in the front endÔºå like musicÔºå alcohol„ÄÇ

 other friends„ÄÇ in the daytimeÔºå people are typically going somewhere„ÄÇ

 and logistics are much more difficultÔºå lending it to much more shallow exchanges„ÄÇ

Even opening 10% above the energy level of that environment in the daytime„ÄÇ

 it would still be incongruent to move things forward very quickly„ÄÇ

It is possible to close in the daytime„ÄÇ I've certainly done it„ÄÇ However„ÄÇ

 expect to spend more time talking to women and spending more time in each interaction that will typically lead to a phone number exchange„ÄÇ

We'll talk more about phone number and social media exchanges later on and why they are generally not advisable„ÄÇ

In the night clubÔºå there are more womenÔºå more attractive womenÔºå a higher emotional baseline„ÄÇ

 and very little on the agenda for everyone to do„ÄÇ Do not skip the night club when going out three nights per week„ÄÇ

You don't have to go out to a nightclub for the rest of your life„ÄÇ

 but you'll have to do it for this year„ÄÇWhat you'll notice in the nightclub is that there appears to be a social hierarchy„ÄÇ

 People in the private areas and the rest of the civilians„ÄÇWhen you build barriers and boundaries„ÄÇ

 as I'd mentioned in previous commandmentsÔºå typically the bus of will go on the inside„ÄÇ

 and you'll see high status people inside of these areas„ÄÇDo not be mistaken„ÄÇ

 These areas do not meet the people there are objectively high value For some of these men„ÄÇ

 This is the best three hours of their whole week„ÄÇMost of these are complete losers„ÄÇ

The same thing goes for the women„ÄÇHoweverÔºå if you're going to find high quality men and women„ÄÇ

 they are likely going to be in these areas„ÄÇFurthermore„ÄÇ

 high quality women will know that they have access to high quality men in these areas„ÄÇ

 which gives you an immediate upper hand„ÄÇTo gain accessÔºå there is oftentimes a cover charge„ÄÇ

 This is your friendÔºå since it serves the dual purpose of gaining you access„ÄÇ

 as well as keeping the losers out„ÄÇYou might think it costs less to pay no cover charge and continue fumbling around the club„ÄÇ

 looking for high quality women than it does to pay a cover charge and gain direct access to the highest percentage of them„ÄÇ

 But you cannot purchase back the time you waste sifting through the muck„ÄÇ

 So better off paying for the cover charge„ÄÇThis goes for any social group„ÄÇ

 let alone access to high quality women„ÄÇDon't lament the cover charge„ÄÇ

 It is actually your best friend„ÄÇ Pay for itÔºå whenever possible„ÄÇ

When navigating in these environmentsÔºå it will be helpful to give up your ideal vision of what people actually are„ÄÇ

Remember from Commandment1„ÄÇMost people are scared„ÄÇ They are selfish„ÄÇ

 and they are waiting to be told what to do„ÄÇEven the people having fau at clubs will drink heavily and clean to their friends because nightclubs are generally an intimidating place„ÄÇ

People will not be loyalÔºå nor keep their word„ÄÇ no matter how much of a connection you built„ÄÇ

 people will generally get rid of you at the first sign of trouble„ÄÇ

There's no reason to be bothered by this„ÄÇ This is generally what people are„ÄÇ

 and it is very difficult to come by someone who can be loyal and keep their word„ÄÇ

You will also find an abundance of dummies around you„ÄÇ

Deerk will often address the Dunning Kruger effect„ÄÇ

 which is a phenomenon that occurs when someone has an over inflated sense of confidence as a direct result of their inability to accurately assess their own competence„ÄÇ

In other wordsÔºå the people are too dumb to know that they're dumb„ÄÇAs a result„ÄÇ

 you might look around and see people who are overconfident in themselves because they aren't really thinking about that much at all„ÄÇ

They don't have the brain power to assess all the complications of the world„ÄÇ

 Too dumb to think too far in the past and too dumb to think too far in the future„ÄÇ

They can neither planÔºå nor learn„ÄÇThey are the poster children of being present to the moment„ÄÇ

Don't be fooled by these excessively confident individuals„ÄÇ They can't help themselves„ÄÇ

 but to think that they're great„ÄÇRegarding womenÔºå where is the right woman that we have talked about so much„ÄÇ

 Did she come out to nightÔºå Is she even at this club„ÄÇDoes she come out to nightclubsÔºü

The answer is that you can reliably expect to find one of these girls for every 20 women you talk to„ÄÇ

The reason for this is complexÔºå and anyone that asks me personallyÔºå we can nerd out„ÄÇ

 and I can explain why I believe this is the caseÔºå but it is completely consistent all around the world„ÄÇ

I challenge you to go talk to 20 women in one evening and one of them not being a highly qualified sexual partner„ÄÇ

HoweverÔºå what you will also find in this set of 20 women is a woman that appears to hate you for no apparent reason„ÄÇ

 other than you just being you„ÄÇüò°ÔºåYou'll experience some variety of go fuck yourself„ÄÇ

 fuck your motherÔºå and I hope you die in a car fire or some other feminine animosty„ÄÇüò°„ÄÇ

You will quite reliably see this womanÔºå as well„ÄÇThere is nothing you could do to change the mind of this woman„ÄÇ

 In factÔºå there might even be a deep seated biological difference in the brain or body that we cannot even describe with words that make you and this woman naturally repellent to one another„ÄÇ

Learn how to mitigate these situations when they come your way„ÄÇ

 understandstand this situation for what it is and then be prepared to continue approaching„ÄÇ

Just because this one woman seems to hate you doesn't mean it is the case for all of them„ÄÇ

 just the same way one seems to love you doesn't mean it is the same case for all of them„ÄÇOverall„ÄÇ

 there will be about two women that hate youÔºå two women that love you„ÄÇ

 one woman that will end up going home with you and 15 women that will be rather indifferent and require further analysis„ÄÇ

Note„ÄÇüò°ÔºåYou might be tempted to see this as 19 out of 20 times you being rejected„ÄÇ

 which feels an awful lot like 20 out of the 20 times being rejected„ÄÇ Remember„ÄÇ

 you are giving yourself permission tovail and you are going to be patient„ÄÇ

 understanding that this is a slow process„ÄÇThere is a direct correlation with anxiety and speed of pattern recognition„ÄÇ

 So you will have to fight against this effect by making sure you're getting in your reps„ÄÇ

 no matter how you feel„ÄÇAs you start going out more and more„ÄÇ

 you will find yourself caring less and less about those two women that hate you„ÄÇ

 and as you start going out a lotÔºå you'll care less and less about all 19 women that don't end up going home with you„ÄÇ

This is great encouragement for continuing to go out„ÄÇ

 even if you don't have initial results with openingÔºå like you mean it„ÄÇThink about it„ÄÇ

 How many times do you need to be toldÔºå F off or to go eat your own dick before you don't feel any emotional attachment behind it any more„ÄÇ

üò°Ôºå5ive timesÔºå13 times„ÄÇIf it was 13 timesÔºå how quickly would you go through those 13 sets if you knew that you could be completely at ease by the 14th set„ÄÇ

With continuous action takingÔºå you will find yourself less and less attached to the feedback„ÄÇ

Roughly about every 20 girlsÔºå you'll find the right girl„ÄÇMaybe it's the first one„ÄÇ

 maybe it's the 20th oneÔºå maybe it's something in between„ÄÇ

 you'll find the one you'll be going home with„ÄÇKeep in mindÔºå when I say the right girl„ÄÇ

 I don't mean the perfect girl„ÄÇ There is no perfect girl„ÄÇ

This is why I emphasize embracing what people actually are„ÄÇ

Most people don't really want to know the truth„ÄÇ They want to be fooled„ÄÇWhen looking at this girl„ÄÇ

 she could either be the perfect girl or the girl who is actually in front of you„ÄÇ

You don't get to have both„ÄÇYou might be disappointed when you learn she isn't the perfect girl„ÄÇ

 but the perfect girl does not exist„ÄÇSo now you've opened this girl like you mean it„ÄÇ

 and you've been vibing with her for some time„ÄÇWhat do you do now„ÄÇWell„ÄÇ

 it would be useful to start gathering logistics„ÄÇHere are five questions that you should repeat over and over until you've memorized them by heart„ÄÇ

Where are you fromÔºüWho are you here withÔºüWhat are you doing later on„ÄÇWhere are you staying„ÄÇ

And what are you doing in the morning„ÄÇThe question„ÄÇ

 where are you from is helpful for gathering social and cultural nuance„ÄÇPersonally„ÄÇ

 I've been around the world and have a detailed understanding of how cultures operate because Ive spent time with their women„ÄÇ

By the wayÔºå there is no better way to feel home at a country and no better confidence builder than to be dropped into a country and meet up with their women„ÄÇ

Derek is a master of not only knowing a variety of cultural backgrounds„ÄÇ

 but picking them apart in such a way that only someone from her own country can do so„ÄÇ

This builds a tremendous amount of comfort„ÄÇThis question allows us to explain why someone would behave a certain way„ÄÇ

 given their cultural background„ÄÇFor exampleÔºå if she is acting quite seriously„ÄÇ

 it may be rather normal if she is from an eastern European country„ÄÇ

 but rather unusual if she was from somewhere else„ÄÇThe question„ÄÇ

 who are you here with is helpful for understanding who I can expect to meet later on„ÄÇ

If she's an attractive womanÔºå most likelyÔºå she is not there alone„ÄÇIs she there with her work friends„ÄÇ

 her college roommateÔºå Maybe she's there with her boyfriend or worseÔºå she's there with her children„ÄÇ

It would be helpful to understand this information and to understand how to interact with each of these individuals when pooling„ÄÇ

FurthermoreÔºå this question speaks volumes about who she is by the company she keeps„ÄÇ

When you meet StaceyÔºå is Staceacy here with her church friends from Utah or with her whole bag friends from Las Vegas„ÄÇ

More information on this and Dek's Coning cock box Bible„ÄÇAs a side note„ÄÇ

 it is important to address these friends proactively„ÄÇ

 If you ignore this question and don't meet the friendsÔºå most certainly„ÄÇ

 they will come and steal your girl before the night is over„ÄÇ

 Avoid the friends to your own detriment„ÄÇThe question„ÄÇ

 what are you doing later on is helpful for understanding if sex will happen tonight„ÄÇ

Does she have no plansÔºå Is she going to a party later„ÄÇDoes she have to catch a plane„ÄÇ

If you avoid this questionÔºå you'll find yourself with your dick in your hand because she liked you„ÄÇ

 but had some lame excuse like smoking weed at an after hour's place with her dealer for his birthday„ÄÇ

The questionÔºå where are you stayingÔºå is helpful to know if you should pursue pulling at all simply from the difficulty of getting back to her place„ÄÇ

Does she stay next doorÔºüYou could probably pull her quickly and bring her back to the club when you're finished„ÄÇ

Does she stay an hour awayÔºå OkayÔºå do you have the means of getting there or helping her get home when you pull to your place„ÄÇ

Even though she's an hour awayÔºå is it still 15 minutes from your home„ÄÇNote that the question is not„ÄÇ

 What's your address„ÄÇDon't be creepy„ÄÇ Just get a general area„ÄÇFinallyÔºå the question„ÄÇ

 what are you doing in the morning is helpful for if she needs to stay over or if you need to stay over„ÄÇ

Does she have work„ÄÇDoes she have an important event to be at„ÄÇ

Is she meeting with a friend that she can probably postpone„ÄÇAgainÔºå time is of the essence here„ÄÇ

You'll want to understand time constraints so that you can effectively solve these problems when they come your way„ÄÇ

If you pay attentionÔºå we are essentially elisting information from others to help solve problems„ÄÇ

Suppose you don't have this information or she won't give it to you„ÄÇ

Does that mean that you can't pull„ÄÇOf courseÔºå you could pull anyways„ÄÇWithout this information„ÄÇ

 you will have to pursue anyways with your best possible guests„ÄÇBut the more details you can cover„ÄÇ

 the better„ÄÇFor exampleÔºå it would also be helpful to know if she has a roommate or multiple roommates so that you know if there will be a problem with you being there or if you will make a lot of noise„ÄÇ

You'll learn through trial and errorÔºå but these questions will get you most of the way„ÄÇ

For these questions and any other information gathering questions„ÄÇ

 if she calls it out or is wondering why you're asking in the first place„ÄÇ

 it just means you haven't provided enough information or personality of yourself yet„ÄÇ

To mitigate thisÔºå what I'll do is pepper these questions in throughout the interaction instead of asking them all at once„ÄÇ

I'll typically have a dual state pumping conversation„ÄÇ

 as well as a get to know you type of conversation„ÄÇ

 I'll switch back and forth between these conversations and ask logistical questions in between„ÄÇüòä„ÄÇ

Think of it like a bank account You have to make deposits into the bank account before you can make withdrawals„ÄÇ

Making statements is like making a deposit and making a withdrawal is like asking questions„ÄÇ

For the first five minutes of the interactionÔºå you are going to be doing most of the talking„ÄÇ

 making mostly statementsÔºå thoughtsÔºå feelingsÔºå observationsÔºå opinionsÔºå storiesÔºå et cetera„ÄÇ

On occasionÔºå the girl or her friends will give you false information like she has a boyfriend or she stays an hour away or give you no information at all„ÄÇ

When this happensÔºå I utilize a clever approach known as the Shaf technique coined by the German master interrogator„ÄÇ

 Han Sharf„ÄÇHe took a very friendly approach to getting information by either assuming he already knew the answers to the questions he was asking or that he did not care about the answers at all„ÄÇ

 because people do not withhold information if they know it is not important or if they know that others already have it„ÄÇ

In the fieldÔºå I'll make a joke of the question or explicitly say that it doesn't really matter to me because of some made up reason„ÄÇ

This might be more useful for gathering information from the friends rather than the girls since the girl more often than not want you to win„ÄÇ

For exampleÔºå if the friend says to me she has a boyfriendÔºå I might say to the friend privately„ÄÇ No„ÄÇ

 she doesn't„ÄÇ She already told me„ÄÇHow she reacts to this information will tell me if it's true or not„ÄÇ

FurthermoreÔºå you will want to be prepared for anything when you get back to your home„ÄÇ

Everything must be clean and welcoming if she feels disgusted at allÔºå she might be turned off„ÄÇ

Have bandaisÔºå have chargers„ÄÇ Does she need food or caffeineÔºå have both„ÄÇ

Activated charcoal tablets taken before bed will help with handovers„ÄÇHave tamons„ÄÇ

 have extra clothes wear like a t shirt and sweatpants„ÄÇHave an extra toothbrush„ÄÇ

 It should go without sayingÔºå but enough condoms to last you a month„ÄÇCertainly„ÄÇ

 you'll have forgotten some thingsÔºå but againÔºå you'll learn with trial and error„ÄÇ

When strategizing your default game plan for pulling„ÄÇ

 you'll want to start at the end point and then work backwards„ÄÇ

 preparepare your room and make it welcoming„ÄÇ Then go backwards„ÄÇ

 How are you going to get from the club to your home„ÄÇThen what is plan BÔºüThen from there„ÄÇ

 where are you going to move the girl within the club when you hook„ÄÇWhat is your default opener„ÄÇ

 What do you do when you get to the clubÔºå Are you opening like you mean it„ÄÇAt this point„ÄÇ

 I'd like to take a moment to discuss effective learning when you are going out and making field reports„ÄÇ

 Logistics are solved quite instinctually and automatically when you get into the club„ÄÇ However„ÄÇ

 they are learned and consolidated when at home„ÄÇAs I've mentioned many times before„ÄÇ

 you have to understand that this all will be a slow learning process„ÄÇ

 You will not learn the game after your first night of going outÔºå nor will it be the first week„ÄÇ

 It might not even be the first year if you're not getting direct coaching„ÄÇ

My process is that if you are able to remove and address all of the obstacles in the way„ÄÇ

 you will simply be able to walk from open to close with ease„ÄÇüòäÔºåWhen I am out in the club„ÄÇ

 I do almost no thinking at all„ÄÇ Much like a martial artist does no thinking in the fight„ÄÇ

 or a surgeon is able to trust his instincts while in the operating room„ÄÇ

 or a stock trader can look at the market and get a sense of what is going to happen next„ÄÇ

Like all of these other professionsÔºå I'll do all of my thinking at home„ÄÇ

I will take the time to look back at a few specific sets from last night and make the following assessment to them„ÄÇ

1Ôºå what happened„ÄÇTwoÔºå what did I do wellÔºü3„ÄÇWhat was the one moment that I lost the interaction„ÄÇfour„ÄÇ

What can I do in that moment next time to prevent it from happening„ÄÇ

I don't want to spend too much time writing field reports because it could be a very time consuming activity„ÄÇ

 This keeps it simpleÔºå and effective„ÄÇI will first describe what happened in that interaction for my own reference to look back to„ÄÇ

I will recognize what I was doing well in that interaction to give myself positive affirmation of what was going right„ÄÇ

 This is important„ÄÇThen I will note the one moment I lost the interaction„ÄÇNote„ÄÇ

I do not want to spend time bemoaning anything I did wrongly„ÄÇ

I believe all negative feedback does has discourage activity out in the field„ÄÇInstead„ÄÇ

 I will look for the single moment„ÄÇ Things started going south„ÄÇFinally„ÄÇ

 I will make a firm statement of what I will do next time when I'm presented with a similar situation„ÄÇ

üòäÔºåSince I'm not doing any thinking at all when I'm out in the club„ÄÇ

 I want to have a single answer readyÔºå prepared and primed in my subconscious when my brain is cud by that situation again„ÄÇ

Will this single answer be the correct oneÔºå the one that I come up withÔºüMaybe it will„ÄÇ

 Maybe it won't„ÄÇ HoweverÔºå I won't know for sure until I go out and test it and test it a lot„ÄÇ

For exampleÔºå one day out in Las VegasÔºå I was out with a girlÔºå and I pulled her to a bar„ÄÇ

I thought that I wanted to feel her hand response to see how intimate me that she was„ÄÇ

 But through thisÔºå she determined that I wasn't pulling her like I meant it„ÄÇ

 That was a single moment that I lost the interaction„ÄÇ

I resolved that next time in that same situationÔºå I will pull firmly„ÄÇ In fact„ÄÇ

 it came in handy the very next night since I was able to pull„ÄÇ

 but not close since I ended up going to the dance floor and staying there too long„ÄÇüòä„ÄÇ

But then I wrote about this situation in the same way I described above„ÄÇ

 resolving to spend only two songs on the dance floor„ÄÇ

 Then that came in handy the very next night when I ended up pullinging and closing„ÄÇ

Do not skip the positive feedback AgainÔºå we want to consolidate all that was working in our behavior by affirming it with positive feedback„ÄÇ

 If you don'tÔºå then you might find yourself rewriting similar reports over and over again„ÄÇAgain„ÄÇ

 for each set„ÄÇWhat happened„ÄÇTwoÔºå what did I do wellÔºü3„ÄÇ

What was the one moment that I lost the interactionÔºüAnd then4„ÄÇ

What can I do in that moment next time to prevent it from happening„ÄÇWhen you end up closing the deal„ÄÇ

 take your time to write a full report of what happened„ÄÇIf you go into a dry streak„ÄÇ

 it will be useful to go back to these to prove to yourself that you can still do this„ÄÇ

 You'll thank yourself laterÔºå and your future self will thank you for the memories„ÄÇ

I wrote everything down that I learned from my first boot camps with Derek„ÄÇ and even to„ÄÇ

 I still find them relevant and useful„ÄÇüòäÔºåWhen writing these reports and reflecting upon your night„ÄÇ

 strive to remain as objective as possible„ÄÇPsychologists call you know that humans create meaning obsessively around everything„ÄÇ

He said„ÄÇPrimitive man is not much interested in objective explanations of the obvious„ÄÇ

But he has an imperative needÔºå or ratherÔºå his unconscious psyche has an irresistible urge to assimilate all outer sense experiences to his inner psychic events„ÄÇ

It is not enough for the primitive to see the sun rise and set„ÄÇThis external observation must„ÄÇ

 at the same timeÔºå be a psychic happening„ÄÇThe son in its course must represent the faith of a God or hero who in his last analysis„ÄÇ

 dwelllves nowhere except in the soul of man„ÄÇDo your best and stay as objective as possible and use the strategies from previous commandments„ÄÇ

 your notes from boot campampÔºå and from the supplemental guidebook to guide your understanding of the social matrix„ÄÇ

Your attitude towards these first many approaches should beÔºå of course„ÄÇ

 that happened and then use these field reports to figure out why they happened and what to do when they come your way„ÄÇ

You can use this general structure to clear out the obstacles in your way„ÄÇPhysical obstacles„ÄÇ

 social obstaclesÔºå psychological obstaclesÔºå emotional obstacles„ÄÇ

Maybe the one moment you lost a girl is because you didn't open like you mean it„ÄÇ

 Write this down and what you will do next timeÔºå Also noting that you did well to approach in the first place„ÄÇ

Maybe the one moment is that the friends came along and took her away„ÄÇ

Write this down and that you will proactively go meet them next time„ÄÇ

 noting all the things you did wellÔºå leading up to this moment„ÄÇOftentimes„ÄÇ

 the moment you lost a girl happened before she even went away„ÄÇ

Pay attention to the shift and energy of the interaction When things start going downhill and look at the moments beforehand„ÄÇ

AgainÔºå you will not be right every single time on what you should do next time„ÄÇ

 but you have to try something and then see what happens„ÄÇ

Use this framework to uncover your hidden values by digging more deeply into the moment you lost the interaction„ÄÇ

 If you have not already elucidated them in commandmentÔºå2„ÄÇ

Maybe you lost a sight when you didn't approach the girl in the grocery store„ÄÇWhat was going well„ÄÇ

 you were considering going for it„ÄÇWhat was the one moment you lost the interaction when you didn't go talk to the girl„ÄÇ

 then dig deeperÔºå why„ÄÇMaybe because other people were watching or she looked busy or some other reason„ÄÇ

What does it say about youÔºüThat's a hidden value„ÄÇMaybe you said because you don't want to interrupt her„ÄÇ

So you would write that you didn't want to interrupt her„ÄÇ And the next time you faced that situation„ÄÇ

 you will interrupt your life to say something„ÄÇOr next time you face that situation„ÄÇ

 you will help her achieve her goals by letting her know that you exist„ÄÇ

Or maybe you will do something else„ÄÇThen we could repeat this process over again„ÄÇ

You'll realize the depth of this structure doesn't stop„ÄÇ

 You can even apply this until you are consistently pulling three sums and have to deal with learning logistics in those situations with this field report structure„ÄÇ

AgainÔºå you'll learn the many of these lessons and events on this program and the various client success interviews and on boot camp„ÄÇ

Remove as many of these obstacles as you can whenever you see them„ÄÇ

 you'll know your obstacles are going away when you find it easier and easier to keep a clear head and start facilitating pulling more efficiently„ÄÇ

 Just like when we get rid of the approaching obstacle by massively approaching and opening like you mean it from the moment you get inside the club„ÄÇ

Maybe the single moment you lose an interaction is when you realize that this girl isÔºå in fact„ÄÇ

 a crack addict„ÄÇThis is a good thing„ÄÇYou've saved yourself the experience of a crack addiction and know that you could walk away„ÄÇ

Write this downÔºå noting for next time what you need to look for when effectively screening for a crack addict in the future„ÄÇ

Screening the girl herself is one of the most important logistical management tools„ÄÇ

Screeen like crazyÔºå hard screeningÔºå like super assertively screening„ÄÇ Tell me about yourself„ÄÇ

 or what's going on with you now„ÄÇOr I like what I see so far„ÄÇAnd„ÄÇI want to investigate„ÄÇ

Most guys are afraid of losing the girlsÔºå because of screening„ÄÇ

But the truth is you're not supposed to get with every9„ÄÇ

 You are only supposed to get with the nines that have chemistry with your particular personality„ÄÇ

Don't waste 30 minutes with a woman when you could have figured out in the first 30 seconds that you don't like her„ÄÇ

Sean outlines a sharp and forward exercise in his segment„ÄÇ

 where your open is intended to reveal some of the sharper parts of your personality and your humor„ÄÇ

In addition to being a tool for conveying your personality„ÄÇ

 it is an extremely effective screening tool and logistical mechanism„ÄÇ

 It is much better to impress upon the girl what type of manual are within the first 30 seconds instead of wasting 30 minutes„ÄÇ

Celebrate when the wrong woman walks away because you have saved yourself potentially hours or even years of suffering„ÄÇ

OftentimesÔºå guys will ask me how they could use their answers to the third question in the three sacred questions exercise to screen the woman„ÄÇ

The best way is to talk about these things with your friends„ÄÇ

Especially you talk about this with your wings„ÄÇ Let them know what type of girl you are looking for„ÄÇ

It will make it easy for them to win with you and help you achieve your goals„ÄÇ

Another tool use is nontop writing or nonstop talking„ÄÇ

I will set a timer and do nothing else but write or talk on some question taking no time to lift my fingers up from the keyboard or pen from the page or no time to pause speaking„ÄÇ

When you continue writing or talkingÔºå keep pushing through„ÄÇ

 even though you might not know exactly what to write or what to say next„ÄÇ

This is a crazy effective way of diving into your creativity and seeing what your brain naturally comes up with when you get into a flow„ÄÇ

you can do this for literally any question you might have„ÄÇ

Take some particular screen that you are looking for in the ideal companion for the life that you want to live„ÄÇ

 Write it down and ask yourself as a prompt„ÄÇ How do I incorporate the screen into a conversation„ÄÇ

Then I will simply just start writing or speaking„ÄÇYou'll find yourself writing or speaking some nonsense or having to repeat words and sentences over and over again„ÄÇ

 but continue to type or say words with the intention of answering the question you presented to yourself„ÄÇ

After a few minutesÔºå you'll end up with a couple of statements and questions that you could deliver right away when you go out to the club„ÄÇ

 Take a moment to log these down somewhere so that you are making sure you're screening the woman for what you are actually looking for„ÄÇ

The useful side effect of this is that while you are solving these problems„ÄÇ

 getting logistics and screening herÔºå your overall attraction is going to go up„ÄÇ

A man who is looking for a particular type of woman indicates that he is a high value individual„ÄÇ

A woman will be attracted simply because she knows that she can't just immediately have him because he is a man of standards„ÄÇ
