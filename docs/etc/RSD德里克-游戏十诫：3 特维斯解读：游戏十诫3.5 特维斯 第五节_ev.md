# RSD德里克-游戏十诫：3 特维斯解读：游戏十诫3.5 特维斯 第五节_ev

Commanment 5， thou shalt convey your identity。I'll start this commandment by picking up where we left off from one of the last commandments that thou shalt open like you mean it。

I gave you a system for when you see a pretty girl 1， make the decision and resolve。

 you're going to talk to her no matter what。2， don't give a fuck about your feelings。

 It's just a girl。 No more， no less。😡，3， be in the best mood you can muster。four。

Give yourself permission to fail and in five， open like you mean it。In other words，1。

 I will talk to her。2 fuck my feelings。 It's just a girl，3， I'm the shit。😡，Four。

 no pressure or permission to fail， and then five open strong。Then I gave you a default opener。Hey。

 you're a pretty girl。 I'm Travis。 What's your name。Then you waited for her response。

 After that response， he started saying words， just start talking。Start making statements， opinions。

 observations， reveal what is on your mind or what your feelings are。

If you've been having trouble with this， note that you're still able to inch towards this ideal every day。

Ideally， you have been on your daily meditation practice。

 You have a fitness routine and a solid diet。If you're frustrated with gaming going out。

 then start here with these other routines and make sure you have these areas of your life in check。

When you have had a solid day of keeping each of these items in check， that being a workout。

20 minutes of meditation and a healthy meal。 Then you could start with just going outside。

Much like going to the gym。 You can work on each of these individual muscles and much like building muscles。

 This is a slow process。Work on the muscle of just going outside。 Just do this much。

Then work on the muscle of going to the nightclub， check。

Then work on the muscle of walking up to the girl。 This is easier said than done for guys who are still beginning。

Sometimes this is all you could do。 It is a muscle。 So we have to work on using it。

Work on it until when you see the girl， you just automatically start walking。

Don't feel like you have to talk to her。 Just walk up to her。Check。😡。

Then just work on the muscle of saying your opener。Hey， you're a pretty girl。 I'm Travis。

 What's your name， Pa。Okay， again。 Hey， you're a pretty girl。 I'm Travis。 What's your name。 Pause。

 Okay， again。 Hey， you're a pretty girl。 I'm Travis， What's your name。 Pa。 Hey， you're a pretty girl。

 I'm Travis。 What's your name。Pause。Like I mentioned in the exercise， just work on it for 10 minutes。

Then work on the muscle of running through the above process。 Sea girl， I will talk to her。

 F my feelings on the shit。 No pressure。 open strong。😡，Sea girl， I will talk to her。 F my feelings。

 I'm the shit。 No pressure open strong。😡，S girl， I will talk to her。 F my feelings。 I'm the shit。

 No pressure。 open strong。😡，When each of these muscles are strong and put together。

 you will have an opening that is going to be pretty strong， and it will feel quite normal。

Leave any of the previous elements out， and you will find that your castle has a weak foundation。

Do whatever it takes to keep moving forward。 If you can't open。

 just ask girls for the time or where the bathroom is or where the bar is or for directions。

Ask where the nearest Starbucks is or where to find something。 It doesn't matter。

 Just get in the habit of going up and talking to women。

If you haven't been going out and talking to women， what are you even doing。

 You're in this to improve the skill set。 You have to take action。If you haven't been going out。

 stop the video。 And for 30 minutes， just go outside and ask women for the time or ask for directions to the nearest Starbucks。

 do it now。If you aren't even going to do this， then go outside and ask anyone for directions to the nearest gynecologist to surgically remove the tampon that is firmly lodged inside of your vagina。

You decide what you're going to do。 The choice is yours。

It is important that you take action every time you practice these exercises and train these muscles is another brick in your castle。

Every approach you make is another brick in your castle。

 It is completely up to you how strong or how large your castle is going to be。

You might think that this all is a lot to remember。

 Don't forget that these are training wheels to use to help you install that entitlement or that lack of emotion to just go up to a girl and start talking。

At any point， you feel you don't need them。 You could shed them off。 And at any point。

 you lose the skill set， you could put them back on。

Much like the writers I described in previous chapters who had very similar daily routines to maximize their creativity。

 If you get these processes on autopilot， then you could devote all your mental bandwidth to the creativity of what you actually say。

Now， the next muscle you will work on that is the subject of this commandment is going to be the muscle of conveying your identity。

 And I will put a focus on what you will be saying in the first five minutes directly after this opener。

 because you are going to be talking for 90 per cent of those first five minutes。

If you ask any woman for dating advice， which I recommend you never do since it is about as effective as asking a deer how to hunt or a fire。

 how it burns or asking an ear of corn how to farm。Women will say some variation of be confident。

 be funny， or just be yourself。When she is saying， be yourself。

 what she is really saying is to be the best version of yourself so that she can make a choice to choose you or not。

She is indicating the paradox of choice that I had mentioned in previous commandments。

 so she would rather you be the best version of yourself so that she could feel right about going with you or not。

The sheer difficulty in being yourself is that most people don't know who they are。Luckily。

 you've solved this in commandment， too， by answering the three sacred questions。

 Half the battle has been won。The only question remains is how do you convey this identity？

In the words of martial artist， Bruce Lee， honestly， expressing yourself is very difficult to do。

 It is easy to put on a show or show you some really fancy movements。

 but to express oneself honestly， not lying to myself and to express myself honestly。

 That is very hard to do。The first step to building the muscle of conveying your identity starts with one thing。

 relaxation。Comedy and improvisational acting legend， Bill Murray had once said。

The more relaxed you are， the better you are with everything。

 The better you are with your loved ones， the better you are with your enemies。

 the better you are at your job， the better you are with yourself。As Deerrick has often said。

 your DNA already knows how to win。 Even your most pathetic ancestor managed to reproduce。

 And here you are。What is more intelligent， some pickup theory or hundreds of thousands of years of evolution。

Your DNA is a set of biological instructions that exist in every cell of your body。

 It is the core instruction that has encoded your anatomical， physiological， behavioral， emotional。

 and cognitive tendencies。Essentially， the way you look， what you feel。

 how you think and how you behave。What makes a game the most challenging thing to teach is that it is something that is learned quite naturally by all members of the animal kingdom。

Humans are the only ones that have the gift or curse of thinking。

 the knowledge of what is right and what is wrong。Learning game by learning routines and scripts is the greatest sin in the history of this whole community。

😊，If any animal can get laid without even having the language to speak。

 then words are not what matters。As mentioned before。

 the words are about 7% to 10% of the communication。We know this fact。

 and that is what makes us superior to other coaches。 It is because we focus on what actually works。

Because the mating ritual is something learned quite naturally by all members of the animal kingdom。

 your DNA already has the instructions for the human mating ritual。As coaches。

 our job is to remove those blockages that are getting in your way of actually enacting this ritual。

In order to get rid of these obstacles， we've covered a number of strategies and commandments one through four。

All of these are meant to help you get out of your own way。When you are able to relax。

 much like a vibrating wine glass or a vibrating guitar string。

 your body can do what it was built to do when it sees a pretty girl。😊。

When you clench onto the wine glass or stifle the guitar string。

 it stops vibrating and stops ringing。The same thing happens when you start clenching in other ways。

An anxious person will express a very narrow range of emotions because he is not relaxed。

Relax does not mean lazy。In fact， some of the best major athletes， performers。

 fighters and leaders are all quite relaxed。😊，If they tense up either their muscles， their voices。

 their craft or their thoughts will be stifled up as well。 And it is a tremendous waste of energy。😊。

People who are relaxed are generally fantastic performers。😊。

You can open like you mean it and convey a very energetic or very dense and potent personality while all still being very relaxed。

This is a very powerful attractant。 The sheer energy of being relaxed is so potent that women will get quite attracted when they meet a guy who seems to be rather relaxed and fluid in his approach。

😊，She's reading that this guy has no anxieties left， So he has nothing to worry about。

 meaning he is certainly a very resourceful individual。 This is what matters。

 not saying the right words。 real honest signals of a man who has a high value。

Being relaxed starts at the open， continues throughout the interaction and even into the bedroom for two people to properly connect on a social。

 a physical and a sexual level。 It is best when they are both relaxed。😊，Relaxed emotionally。

 relaxed psychologically， and even relaxed physically。Even though you need to be very。

 very hard on yourself to make sure you get into the set and open like you mean it。

Once you have approached， gave yourself permission to relax completely。

Relaxation is a muscle that again will be a slow process to build and you will not get it right away。

 so be aware of this muscle and give yourself permission to relax once you get into set。Despite this。

 you will likely be stressed from all the environmental factors in the club or from your general mood。

You cannot force relaxation。 You just have to be O with the fact that you might be a little nervous or maybe even very nervous or emotional in some other way。

 but have the general intention of being relaxed。That's what we mean when we say。

 give yourself permission to be relaxed instead of just relax。

If you've been meditating and exercising on a regular basis。

 then relaxation should be no problem for you because relaxation happens in the mind and in the body。

Personally， to relax my mind， I make sure to start approaching when I get to the club right away to prove to my brain that there is no real threat in the environment。

 And I relax my body by making sure my voice and my shoulders are open and relaxed。😊。

These are typically the areas they get the most tense。

 so I make sure I pay close attention that they are at ease。

If you have ever seen guys who get really good at this。

 youll notice that their whole body is relaxed， including the way they speak。

 and you will start feeling relaxed as a result of just being in their presence。 This is no accident。

😊，As another tool to be relaxed， help put some one else around you at ease。 This could be your wing。

 Some of the first couple girls you talked to or even her friends。

When you are opening like you mean it， you are already putting the grow in front of you at ease through the practices you are already employing。

If you ever watch me at a VIP tour talk or a debrief in boot camp。

 youll notice that this is what I am naturally doing， putting others at ease。English actor。

 Sir John Rice Davies， even went so far as saying， if you can make other people feel comfortable。

 you will really be on your way the changing the world。

You now know the first step of building the muscle of conveying identity and that is working on the muscle of relaxation。

The next step of building the muscle of conveying your identity。

 which will also help build the relaxation muscle， is the muscle of self trust。

You build self trust through self acceptance。This is a gentle reminder of commandment 1 to accept no false gods before you。

You cannot convey your identity unless you have taken ownership of it。

 So embrace you for all of your strengths and all of your flaws。

We take this practice of relaxation and apply this into your identity。

 with the result being complete self trust and self acceptance。

You do this by having an attitude of just being O with whatever it is that you are doing。

 If you said something dumb， that's O。Congratulate yourself for saying something。

If you are giving a speech and you're not fully prepared， that's okay。 Keep plowoughing through。

You will initially find it hard to shake the feeling of inferiority。

 that feeling of I'm not good enough， or I need to get better。However。

 this is the very feeling that has won you all of your accomplishments to this day。😊。

If you never felt inferior， would you ever strive to do better。If humans never felt inferior。

 would they ever build skyscrapers or vehicles or climb mountains or any other major accomplishment。

😊，Etem psychologist Alfred Adler described this feeling of inferiority as a functional emotion that is emotional drive to get you better and to improve。

However， the danger of this is that if you feel inferior and then you don't do anything about it。

 then it grows into what we call an inferiority complex。

The result of this is a feeling of my skill set at talking with women is not good enough。

 which grows into the identity of I am not good enough。

The dangerous aspect of this piece of psychology is that no one wants to endure being inferior their whole life。

 So this inferiority complex turns into a superiority complex where people learn to celebrate that they are not good enough or put others down around them to make themselves feel better。

This would explain why many oppressed groups you see protesting on the news media goes so far as to celebrate their identity around the manner in which they are being oppressed。

Notice about these groups how they are focused on an unchanging identity around their inferiority and take every effort to knock on people who are doing much better than them。

In fact， most people will try to knock you down when making improvements in this area because they don't want to admit to themselves the painful reality that they。

 too， once felt inferiority and success with women， but they did nothing about it。Overall。

 this feeling of inferiority is what drives you to improve， so celebrate it and be grateful for it。

However， this feeling of inferiority is meant to be suspended or turned off when you are in the nightclub。

Accept it for what it is and embrace the current version of yourself as the best version you got。

 The nightclub is a shift in intention where you get to celebrate you。😊。

Self acceptance means that you have come to terms and embraced yourself for all your strengths and all your flaws。

 It means that you are doing the very best that someone like you could do。

 and you are O with the fact that it can still be better。

You're giving the best version you have right now。There comes a time in the journey of self improvement。

 where you have to look around and smell the roses。If you work on yourself forever。

 you can always make improvements， but you can have your cake and eat it。 too。

 You can enjoy the spoils of your victory。😊，As an exercise to prove this。

 write down 20 things that you can be grateful for 20 things that you have accomplished。

Look at this list and literally congratulate yourself for the hard work you would accomplish so far and all of the work you look forward to achieving in the future。

As a I note， consider many of the girls you are intimidated with talking to。

You would not even like them if you knew them better。 In fact。

 you would pay many of them to go away from you。The more dismissive and judgmental a woman is。

 the more likely that she is living a subpar life。Isn't that fucked up that the people that are knocking you down and putting you down are almost always the people with the most problems in their own lives。

 and that is their strategy about feeling good about themselves。There is no right or wrong。

Commit to yourself and commit to the interaction。I mention at the end of commandment 1。

 when a man has nothing left to be taken from him， what left does he have to fear。

If you already know who you are and what you want， what could someone possibly say that could take this away from you。

I'll repeat this because it's worth embracing this concept。

 If you already know who you are and what you want。

 what could someone one possibly say to take this away from you。

If some woman is able to knock you off of your frame。

 then maybe you haven't fully embraced who you are yet。Go back to commandment to to embrace this。

 or if some woman has knocked you off your frame， then that means that you will have to add something about who you are and what kind of man you are。

Go back to commandment2 for more review on doing this。

There's no predicting how people will originally take you， but the more you accept yourself。

 the more their feedback just doesn't matter。The reason why we work on the muscle of relaxation is that it gets girls very attracted。

But it also allows the words to flow out of your mouth and your DNA to feed you the instincts to close the grow in front of you。

The reason why we work on the muscle of self acceptance is so that you can be perfectly okay with what you choose to say after your opener instead of having the perfect thing to say。

You can see that I am helping you shake loose the content that is already in your head so that you could just start talking immediately in those first five minutes of the interaction。

After you've been working on relaxation and self acceptance。

 you now want to work on the muscle of self enthusiasm。

Self enthusiasm means that you are excited about who you are and excited about the life that you are living。

People will often ask me how to convey the second question of the three second questions into their conversations。

How do they convey， What kind of life do they want to live。

The answer to that question is simply just to start living that life。

Take a look at one of your answers that you wrote down from the three sacred questions exercise on what kind of life do you want to live。

Take a moment right now。 pauseuse the video and look at one of these answers。From that answer。

 ask yourself， if you were living that type of life。

 what would you do to start embodying what you wrote down。

I already mentioned this in a previous commandment to dedicate some time every day。

 every day to doing things that you want to do instead of the things that are only demanded of you。

Pause a video and take a moment right now， don't wait to start moving towards the life that you want to live。

Come back in about 10 minutes。 I'll wait。In the words of epicpictetus。Don't explain your philosophy。

 Embody it。You have literally written down the instructions of the type of life you want to live。

 So if you haven't started， start living it。You may be asking， but Travis。

 what does living this life have to do with the first five minutes of the conversation？

 How do I convey my identity to start living the life I want to live。

Derek has often said that there are two ways you can get good at this game。

One way is to be a great manipulator by understanding what gets women attracted and then emulating those behaviors to press her buttons。

The other way is by being a great man， naturally developing yourself and letting those signals come off naturally。

Whether you would choose to be a great manipulator or a great man。

 both would take the same amount of time。Also from Derek， you don't get what you want。

 You get what you are。You're not going to get your 9， if you are two。

We will talk about building your value in commandment10。

Does the cool guy need something cool to say or is he just a cool guy？He has relaxed。

 embraced his identity and is excited about who he is。

 And the girl is turned on by all these things in between the words that he is actually saying。😊。

For all we care， he could be talking about tap water or the new addition to his stamp collection or the implications of the falling price of gold on the global economy。

The words are simply vehicles to convey the essence of who you are to the girl in front of you。

When you are actually living your life in the way you described in what kind of life you want to live。

 the subject matter of what you actually say， especially in those first five minutes。

 will just come out of your mouth automatically。After you have her attention。

 pay attention to the first thing that comes up to your head。

Maybe the way she looks reminds me of a character in a book you read recently。Or where she is from。

 reminds you of the last time you went to that country。

Or something she said reminds you of a song lyric you heard recently or maybe something completely out of the ordinary。

This is not any life that you wrote down in question to。

 This is the type of life that will get you most excited。

 And if you are filling your life with the things that make you most excited。

 then your attention will also be filled with the subject matter of communication of the things you are most excited about。

😊，Furthermore， if you are living your life in the way you can be excited about。

 you can always assume that the set will work。 and as a result。

 it will become a self fulfilling prophecy。She is going to get a good sense what type of man are。

 by the way you communicate and what you choose to talk about。 And that， my friend。

 is how you convey your identity。This is the first time Im asking you to simply let go and to trust yourself instead of giving you something specifically to say。

 And that initially will feel wrong and uncomfortable。

 like jumping into a swimming pool filled with vanilla pudding， but naked。It feels so wrong。

 but it feels so right at the same time。Now that you've been working on the muscles of relaxation。

 self acceptance and self enthusiasm。Let's talk about some mechanics of conveying your identity。

Combin your identity starts with eye contact。Eye contact is one of the most powerful tools of attraction。

If there was a cheap code you wanted to build attraction。

 special attention should be made to eye contact。Ee contact is so powerful that a study had shown that when they had men and women look at each other for just 15 minutes and nothing else like no talking。

 no movement， nothing， just 15 minutes of eye contact。

Their respective partners rated each other's attractiveness as much higher。In fact。

 one participant group ended up going on a day afterwards， and they are currently married today day。

Since Deerrek is a serious pimp， when he would be getting noncompli or a lot of shit。

 Deerk would simply take the girl and just get her to look him in the eyes。

Once she would look into his eyes， she would see no wavering and see that Derek is a fucking closer。

You could see where a guy is in the game by his eyes。 and girls can tell everything from your eyes。

 A man who is uncomfortable or uneasy will look around in a bunch of different areas with twitchy eyes。

 And women have often told me that they notice this and have lost your traction as a result。

Sometimes women will just look you in the eyes before saying anything to you because they are gathering information about who you are from the way you make eye contact。

When you are opening， if you haven't already， make a special effort to hold eye contact。 and。

 moreover， a relaxed eye contact。 You could put women at ease with your eyes alone。

If your eyes are alarmed， she， too， will be alarmed。If your eyes are angry， she。

 too will become angry。😡，If your eyes are at ease， then she， too， will become relaxed。

You can also convey your sexual intent with your eye contact。

Conveyor your identity with an easy and relaxed eye contact。

You also convey your identity with projecting your voice and clear communication。

When you convey your identity， you are literally transmitting emotion and information from you to the girl in front of you。

 If she cannot hear you， then the interaction is over。 In fact， it never even began。

Anyone that has been on BoC knows that this is the very first thing we talk about every single week because it is so incredibly important。

 and it is one of the practices that is required in order for you to proceed with anything else。

Project your voice with a downward tonality to convey authority and potency。

This immediately conveys to a woman the strength and the weight of your personality。

 and even that you are to be taken seriously。It sounds simple。

 but projecting voice is not only the difference between zero and 50 sexual partners in one year。

 but it is the difference between a couple thousand and a couple of million dollars per year。Why。

When you project your voice， people pay attention， regardless of the validity of what you are saying。

 when you project your voice， you are speaking to the emotional part in other human beings and commanding their attention。

Furthermore， you change your own physiology when you project your voice loudly。

The change in your voice commands your brain to follow suit and start dominating your internal emotional state and the social resources around you。

Like eye contact， this cannot be understated。 Project your voice。

Make a special effort to project your voice about 10% above the energy level of the environment that you are in。

Another mechanic of conveying your identity is free flowing communication。

You don't actively come up with the words， you simply allow them to come out of your mouth。

Go back to the exercise where you just talk continuously without stopping。

If we do this exercise without stopping for 10 minutes with no breaks。

 you will find that your mouth is moving quite automatically。

This is an ideal state of communication and definitely the style of communication。

 I'd recommend you employ with your wing or on your own before hitting the nightclub。

 Just talk continuously and relaxed。😊，What you'll notice is that you'll draw upon the environment to come up with the content of your communication。

 the lamp in the room， the window， the tree outside。Furthermore。

 each of these items will be chained to another thought， which gets chained to another thought。

 We call this free association or the chain of associations。When you are walking up to a woman。

 Exp to know nothing about what you are going to say next。

 Just deliver your opener and trust your mind to deliver what will come next。Now。

 a common problem with just trusting the free flow of association is that one might be tempted to use free flow as a technique。

Hey， you're pretty girl。 I'm Travis。 What's your name。

 There's a lamp outside the window and the tree。 napapkins are useful。 Pineapples are tasty。

Like I said before， the free flowing exercise is meant to prove to your brain that you could hold a conversation。

 If you engage with this exercise anyway， iss like I just demonstrated。

 this might succeed in getting a confused response from the girl。

If your nonverbals I mentioned from above are dialed in。

 then the girl is going to get attracted anyways， but we could do better。Furthermore。

 your brain is spending a lot of energy and mental bandwidth trying to come up with something to free associate off of。

To remedy this， we will get to the core of the type of game that Dererick teaches。

 and that is radical honesty。Conveying your identity means speaking honestly。

 Sp honestly means trusting the first thing that comes to your head and then saying it。The book。

 Radical honesty by Brad Blanton explains this best how speaking honestly has an extraordin amount of positive。

 primary， secondary and tertiary effects on one's life and how telling the truth improves your overall well being。

😊，Deerk was always disgusted by the pickup community how they were teaching lines。

 tips and even magic tricks when he was busy going to the number one business school in the world and building multimill dollar companies。

😊，I had a similar experience when I first started going out。 I've studied at an Ivy League school。

 I have a career。 I've been a professional musician。

 I've come out of an extraordinarily rocky situation to be a very successful individual。

 I've travelled the world。 Why do I need to hide all of that。😊。

Deerrerick speaks very frequently about the wanting it tax。

 The price you pay for needing an interaction to work is that you can never have her and that you will end up with exactly the type of woman you are willing to walk away from。

I would combine these few thoughts to provide the conditions in which an interaction will always work out。

Be ready to write this down。Ready。😊，The need to speak honestly must be greater than the need to make it work。

One of the CEOs speaking at my graduation left us with this mystic advice that the secret to a longer and healthier life is to have your on stage life congruent with your backstage life。

I think I finally know what that means。 It means that you are speaking honestly。

 both positive and negative。Speaking， Osley is almost always the best possible strategy。

 because if a man is of high value to the right type of woman。

 it is in his best interest to speak as honestly as he can。

 because it will naturally convey himself and attract the woman he is looking for。

I once found myself going through your phase where I was saying some very self defeating things to other women and couldn't get out of this rut When I asked Derek on my third boot camp。

 the same boot camp， I was pulling enclo on both nights after having done the same thing on my previous boot camp。

 Drek said you should spend every day caring less and less about what she thinks about you and spend every day building your own person of value to the right woman more and more。

You should care no more about what she thinks than a goldfish being flushed down the toilet in the state of Texas。

Have the audacity to be yourself。I chose not to care at all about the response and focus on what was actually on my mind。

The very next set I saw the girl looked like she needed to be dance with。

 So I just went up to her and started dancing with her。From this。

 I pulled one of the most attractive girls I'd ever been with up until that point。

Ask me on boot camp， and I can show you pictures。If you are living the life that you want to live。

 then you will naturally attract the type of woman for that life。

 So speaking honestly is the best way to indicate this information to the other woman。

When you speak honestly， know that you cannot hold one thought back and then invent another thought at the same time。

 just the same way you cannot beat a river into submission。

 You must surrender to its current and use its power as your own。

 taking it into your service and economizing it。😡，The reason you get tongue tied and stop talking is because there is something you are not saying that you need to be sane。

Additionally， if you ask around enough， you find that women are begging for the truth and for something real。

To attractive women and powerful men for that matter， their lives are filled with so many lies。

 There is so much dishonesty， and they spend so much of their energy to figure out what is real and what is fake When these people can find a man who is honest。

 They are at the very least curious to hear more because， again。

 they know they cannot find that type of man anywhere else。

It is for this reason that this type game works extraordinarily well for very attractive females。

 because their bullshit detectors are much， much more refined than the average looking girls。

 The only way to convey honesty to these women is to be honest with them。😊，The commandment is。

 thou shalt convey your identity， not someone one else's identity。

 If you start saying some fake shit， you start fucking up your own flow。

 And when the girl realizes everything has been fake After a while。

 she starts questioning why she was attracted to you in the first place。

 And these girls don't end up sticking around or flaking very quickly。😡。

This is why Drerick gets very little last minute resistance and why most women he hooks up with have a very。

 very low flake rate。What all of this means is after relaxing， accepting yourself。

 living your life in a way that you can be excited about， projecting your voice， holding eye contact。

 approaching and opening like you mean it。 You are going to say the first and most honest thing。

 And you are going to keep talking about it after the opener。😊，Hey， you're pretty girl。

 I want to come say hi。 I'm Travis。 What's your name， Triricsha， Trisha， I'm not an alcoholic。

 but you're really making me consider making some bad decisions with that dress you wearing。Hey。

 you're pretty girl。 I want to come say hi。 I'm Travis。 What's your name。 Cathy， Oh。

 my mom's name is Cathy。 I'm sorry this is， this is just too weird。 I might just have to walk away。

Hey， you're pretty girl。 I want to come say hi。 I'm Travis。 What's your name。 Alice。

 are you from Finland， My friend has the exact same style of hair as you do。

 Finninish people are quite funny。 They have this。 They have that bh， bh， bh， b， b。😊，Hey。

 you're a pretty girl。 I want to come say hi。 I'm Travis。 What's your name， Jennifer。

 do you know where the bathroom is， I've never been to this club before。Hey， you're a pretty girl。

 I want to come say hi。 I'm Travis。 What's your name。Brittany。

 you look simultaneously like the best and the worst thing that ever happened to me。

 Buy me roses and slash my car attis， unforgivable。The point is not to copy these lines。

 The point is to trust whatever comes to your mind after you're open and then run with it。

During the four days per week you are going out in the day time for the five girls a day you are talking to。

 A great stock routine to use when you are getting started might be， hey， you're pretty girl。

 I'm Travis。 What's your name。 Oh， Melissa， I just want to say I thought your bag was interesting。

 Or maybe you might say， oh， it looks like you were a walking with a purpose。 I gotta run。

 Hope you have a good day。Or simply。Hey， I wanted to say hi。 I thought you were a pretty girl。

 but I have to run。 Hope you have a good day。This will be sufficient to keep your social momentum for the three nights per week that you go out to the nightclub。

I am completely trusting myself and being radically honest when I am following up my opener。

 because I repeat this again。 The need to speak honestly must be greater than the need to make it work。

Here are some tools and structures you can use when you are speaking after opening。

The first one is the Col read， which is essentially an observation about her and what that observation makes you think of or what it makes you curious about。

The second is an environmental observation， which is essentially calling out something you notice about the environment and then building a conversation on that。

Another one is asking for an opinion， which you could ask or， you know。

 something you've been thinking about or curious about lately。

 something from the life you've been very intentionally living。

Another one is to offer an opinion which you bluntly offer something you believe in。

 The sharp ends forward exercise turns this opinion into a screening tool。

You can learn more about the Shaens Ford exercises from Sean's commentary。And then finally。

 dark humor， which we will talk about in commandment 6。

Each of these conveys your identity because it indicates to her your genuine personality via the things you think about most。

Again， the need to speak honestly must be greater than the need to make the interaction work。

 This honesty continues through the middle parts of your conversation as well。

Derek and I like to convey some very， very vulnerable aspects about our own personal lives。

 He taught me the best way to frame these stories is to explain the story arc in such a way that she could see how I beat it out to indicate my resourcefulness。

Honesty is about revealing all parts of yourself， both the positive and the negative。

When you are speaking honestly and trusting yourself to speak honestly， you are building congruence。

 which means that your thoughts， Word and actions are all in harmony， which。

 according to Mahatma Gandhi， is the formula for real happiness。 when your thoughts。

 words and actions are in harmony。😊，Conveying your identity and speaking honestly also means that you uphold your own personal values。

 no matter what。Speaking honestly comes at a price。

 It means that when someone challenges you or says something you disagree with。

 you must uphold your own values， especially when you know it will create a disagreement or tension in the interaction。

This tension is oftentimes discounted， but it is very important for a connection to happen。

You must uphold your own values。 Therefore， you must work on the muscle and the strength of your own frame。

Your frame is essentially your own worldview。 It will be challenged over and over again for the rest of your life。

It is up to you how strong you will make it and how much you will sacrifice it for other people。

What is the proper balance？The correct answer， according to Derrick。

 is to make the strength of reality as strong as you can and to sacrifice it for no one。

Why you might ask。Some people might be tempted to adapt to other people。 but as I mentioned before。

 if we tried to mod and adapt to every single person for the amount of women we expect you to talk to this year。

 you will go insane。You must stick to your core identity。

 and you must hold it from situation to situation。In fact。

 the advantage of conveying your identity and not letting it budge across situations is that you are creating value。

Remember back to Commandment 2， I mentioned how your natural attractiveness to all females overall goes up when you embrace your core individual identity。

 The reason for this is that you are creating boundaries。

Type boundaries means higher quality in some way that reflects those boundaries。

The gold is on the inside of the castle。 The treasure is on the inside of the chest。

 Your own personal quality is reflected by your own personal boundaries。

Note that this builds trust with other people that share your values。

They know that they could trust you to protect the equality and not give it away for free to everyone else。

 Every one can't be special。 Special is what separates one individual from the next。

 If every one is special， then no one is。You must take on your own values。

 We start this process by living our life the way that we actually want to live it。

Strive to stay the same across social situations。Consciously practices do not change from environment to environment。

 Someone who remains calm and firm in their beliefs， despite changing times and circumstances。

 is what makes a strong leader。Have the strengths to not let your character traits waver no matter the emotion you are in。

 You are1010% yourself。How do you uphold your own values Again。

 the need to speak honestly must be greater than the need to make it work。

The women will respect you for this， and it will ironically strengthen the connection， why。

Because if you are saying something that is simultaneously true to you and not designed to convince or persuade or get attraction from the woman。

 she knows that she could trust you and that you are far more excited about yourself than you are about her。

I've learned that the world we live in has proved out that you must be disagreeable to some extent before the girls you talk to can begin to trust you at all。

Here's a simple example。 Suppose you love ice cream， and you say， I love ice cream。Well， yes。

 but so does most people。But if you don't like ice cream， you might risk being disagreeable。

But if you say， I hate ice cream， it certainly helps to make you stand out。

If you're willing to stand out， not only do they see that you're not trying to kiss their ass。

 they could differentiate you from the other men in the dating market。 This is called polarizing。

 and I'll explain it more in Commandment 6。As a side note。

 this is why the sharp ends forward exercise is so effective。

 because the need to speak honestly is greater than the need to make it work。

If you are making sacrifices to make the interaction work。

 you will pay what is called the sanction of the victim。

The concept sanction of the victim is defined by philosopher Leonard Pyoff as the willingness of the good to suffer at the hands of evil and to accept the role of sacrificial victim for the sin of creating values。

Values in this case is meant to be ethics。Throughout the Iron round book， Atla shrugged。

 numerous characters are frustrated by this sanction， for example。

The character at Hank Riidean appears duty bound to support his family。

 Despite their hostility towards him。 Later， the principal stated by the character， Dan Conway。

 I suppose somebody's got to be sacrificed。 If it turned out to be， I have no right to complain。

Finally， the character John Galult further explains his principle。Evil is impotent and has no power。

 but that which we let it extort it from us。I saw that evil was impotent。

 and the only weapon of its triumph was the willingness of the good to serve it。According to Derek。

What is a man other than his intellectual resources and his beliefs。

What distinguishes one man from the next。All that differentiates one man from the next is his intellectual resources and his beliefs Do not sacrifice these。

 Tell these women what is right and what is wrong， Then who will。

This is important because every time one person changes their mind。

 Another 50 of their friends will be influenced as well。 and each of their 50 friends， too。

 meaning the belief of one person could potentially influence the opinion of thousands。

In the words of psychologist， Jordan Peterson， if enough people live their lives in this pathological way。

 then they pathologize their society。 And if enough people do that， then it's hell。

The world around you from moment to moment is trying to tell you what is right and what is wrong。

Strengthen the muscle to uphold the values which you believe are right and discourage the values which you believe are wrong。

 or you will pay the price of sacrificing your identity to the false gods that demand your quiet servitude。

I'll conclude the section with some frames to utilize。 build on what we have already discussed。Again。

 a frame is your worldview， and from it emerges everything that you'll say or do in your interaction。

It sets the tone for the whole interaction。Once I've gone through my process to go and approach and open like I mean it。

 here's what I'm thinking about。My first frame is that we are on the same team。

We are both out to accomplish something。 And as a man of value。

 there is certainly something I can offer in exchange for something she can offer。

 We're both in it to win it。 So when I first go say hi and I'm holding relaxed eye contact with her。

 I can honestly feel that we already know each other or that we've already skipped the step of being strangers。

😊，The trigger and catalyst for this frame it is focusing on being relaxed。

My second frame is there's a million dollar check in my back pocket。

How would you approach her if you had a million dollar check in your back pocket that you were going to give to her。

How would you approach her knowing that you are actually her best option in life。

 that you are a cool guy and you're about to give her the opportunity of a lifetime to go meet you？

Furthermore， how do you react when they refuse that check， The first response is confusion。

 but I accept that not everyone wants that kind of value or that entrepreneurial white guys who travel the world is not for them。

It is important that you have this type of enthusiasm upon the approach and that you believe you are the best option in the whole club。

 no matter what anyone says。And the words of footballer Christiano Ronaldo。

 considered one of the greatest of all time。If you don't believe you are the best。

 then you will never achieve all that you are capable of。

The trigger for this frame is when I remember that I'm the ship before even approaching and that I am living my life the way I had written down in my three sacred questions。

The third frame is nothing to gain。 nothing to lose。

I don't want to feel like there's anything at stake the same way I don't feel like there is anything at stake when I button my shirt this morning。

 or when I brush my teeth。This has the effect of removing all motion and giving me the entitlement that is useful for taking massive action and moving lots of interactions forward。

I do not value the things outside of my control。 I only value the things in my control。

 So there's nothing for me to gain and nothing for me to lose。

 All I can do is take the best action I can take in my current state。Furthermore。

 if she sees that I don't need her and am conveying personality。

 more excited about speaking  honestly， she'll be more intrigued to engage。😊。

The triggering catalyst for this frame is when I remember not to care about my feelings and to remember no pressure and give myself permission to fail and have full acceptance of who I am。

The last frame is having a 10000 or a 10000 kilo personality。When I am at my best。

 my personality is potent and dense and can be thoroughly felt by the women who interact with me。

It is important to remember that she wants a man。As Deerk once wrote me in my first email to him。

 if she wanted a little bitch， she would be a lesbian。Therefore。

 I will be the most potent version of myself and make sure the weight of my personality is felt by the people around me。

 and they know it cannot be blown over。The trigger and catalyst for this is speaking loudly。

 clearly and with a relaxed eye contact and stating the values that I believe in。Overall。

 conveying your identity or being yourself， although very hard to do。

 can be cultivated as follows The same way we have been working on other muscles and commandments 1 through 4。

Build the muscle of relaxation。Build the muscle of self trust through self acceptance and build the muscle of self enthusiasm in the ways I described above。

With these muscles， you convey your identity by making relaxed eye contact。

 projecting your voice firmly and use what is exactly on top of your mind to speak honestly and freely。

 knowing you will value speaking honestly much more than making the interaction work at all。😊。

You will continue to speak honestly throughout the interaction by letting the words on the top of your head pour out like a river。

 allowing your honest likes and dislikes come to the surface of the conversation。

You'll continue to uphold your values throughout the conversation。

 especially when it creates conflict because it raises your own personal of value。

 build sexual attention， and build a new level of trust， comfort and connection。Finally。

 when engaging， you are utilizing your own frames to convey your reality。

 My favorites are we are already on the same team， million dollar chuck in my back pocket。

 Nothing to win， nothing to loose。 and I have a 10000 personality。😊。

You now have the necessary tools to transition from the opener directly into the follow through。

 speaking at very least through the first five minutes of the interaction and forevermore。

 being able to convey your identity。As a final exercise。

 go outside and start developing strong opinions about what you see around you。

 Even on basic objects like cars or street signs， there are no right or wrong answers。

 but take a stance of why you like something or why you don't like something or what something is or what something isn't with some opinionated reasoning behind it。

Furthermore， develop opinions on what you see on the news。

 making a strong stance on them and making reasons why you believe in what you believe in。

Leave no room for indifference。 If you truly are indifferent about something。

 make a stance about why you're supposed to be indifferent。

Become polarizing in your preferences and what you believe in and get into the habit of doing so for everything else you encounter going forward When you are in your interactions。

 let these women know these opinions and why they are right。

 There is no way for her to know what you are until she knows what you believe in。

Thou shalt convey your identity。
