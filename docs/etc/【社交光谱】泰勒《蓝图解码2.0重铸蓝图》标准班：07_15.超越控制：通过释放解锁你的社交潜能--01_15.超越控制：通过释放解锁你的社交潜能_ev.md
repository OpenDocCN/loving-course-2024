# 【社交光谱】泰勒《蓝图解码2.0重铸蓝图》标准班：07_15.超越控制：通过释放解锁你的社交潜能--01_15.超越控制：通过释放解锁你的社交潜能_ev

Yeah。我是社交官谱莱特，那么我们继续蓝图解码2。0之旅。这节课呢讲了什么呢？就是在演讲社交和生活中啊，如何通过释放而非控制来去释放，激发我们的个潜能，去接触更高的力量。

我们大多数人啊都习惯于通过控制，来应对生活中的挑战，就像不停的去收缩肌肉试图通过更多的努力和紧张啊来达成目标，但事实上啊过度的控制，会让人适得其反。会让我们这个身心啊处于一种紧张。

🎼疲惫创造力匮乏的一个状态。看看我们在社会上啊，多少人是沉浸在自己的手机里面，使得他们无法专注于任何的事情，无法去完成任何的事情，基本上啊这些人就像一个机器人一样，被告知该怎么做啊。

他需要别人告诉他应该做什么。其实他们已经丧失了正确的一种思考能力。这种状态呢不仅仅影响我们的表达，还有人和人的互动交往。也限制了我们在事业和生活中啊去发挥自己的潜力。好的。

那我们正式进入接下来的一个课程。We're going to go and exercise。 I can see in the pupil right in the eye。

 the extent to where your brain's neurochemistry is。 I know right in the eye。😡，Okay。

 I see it within seconds， The reason why there's been studies on this。

 who's ever heard of Robert Sulsky。Is that his name， he was a researcher in now Berkeley， okay？😡。

So Robert Sulsky， he did blood tests on baboons， and the low status baboons would have higher cortisol and adrenaline。

 and they get sick more。I don't get sick。There's a change in my body chemistry。 Okay。

 so understand that your body chemistry is going to change as you become a leader， Okay。

 and you'll think more easily。 It'll be easier to lock in and focus。😡。

Like when you're around someone that has this， their degree of focus virtually is borderline creepy。

They can focus on things for hours。 Look at what we see in society。

 Everybody's retreating in their phone， They can't focus on anything。 They can't get anything done。

 They're basically just being told what to do like a robot。😡。

They need someone to tell them what to do。 They can't think straight。 I see it I you know。

 give a hard time to my camera team all the time。 You know。

 like they'll kind of get in this kind of mode or they're just listening to me。 I'm like。

 be creative， I something， initiate a cool shot。 and try something different。😡。

The main thing I think in my mind all the time as a leader is just what else I just go， what else。

 what else， what else， what else， what else， what else， what else， what else。

 And I loop on that all day。😡，It's called lateral thinking。

 It allows you to be very creative in the moment and find solutions quickly。 Okay。

 so that's the vocal stuff that we covered。 And yesterday， again， like we said。

 we separate the vocal tone from the content。😊，Likewise。

We have the different vocal cadence that we worked on。

 We have the different projection that we worked on。 What were some other ones that we did yesterday。

 remind me Oh yeah， merging your energy into the voice， merge into the word。

 bringing yourself into it in presence。 What were some other exercise we did yesterday Yes。

 that's right。 The different representations of a word right remember lollipop lollipop lollipop lollipop with all the different variations and cadence。

 So basically what we have is we have it to where you can put energy in what you're saying。

 you can bring conviction and what you're saying， you can use dominant vocal tones or whatever vocal tone you want。

 you can use different pitch， different cadence and put all of yourself into it to be electric。

 and we focused on congruence yesterday as well。 Okay so you guys remember those lessons。

 I'm gonna bring you to the front and have you do that and show you where you're messing it up。

 Okay But what I'm gonna do now is I'm going break into the next exercise， which is very key。

 And this is really in some ways the key to everything。 And here's what it is。 okay。

I also learned this from my socializing days。 Okay， here's what it is。

Let's say that I'm talking to somebody who I might want to date。 And as I'm talking to them。

 what's going to happen is I'm talking， I'm talking and。Some other guy comes up。

 right and is talking the same person I'd want to talk to。

If that guy is trying a little bit too hard， he's just trying a little bit too hard。And I don't care。

😡，The person that I'm talking to will roll their eyes， almost like they're being ridiculous。

And I just say loose。 And then that person gets vaporized。

 And this will happen every night you go out。 Okay， It's like in a rat。

 do you guys know how rat battle works。Okay， you know， like a frees sellyle ra battle？

So what happens is one MC goes up and starts dising the other MC。😡，Now。

 part of freesting is that free asciative speaking that we're teaching here， right？😡。

So if one battle wrapper really gets under his skin and just gets at him。

 the other guy's winner effect will shut down， and then he has a harder time for associating。

 and he can't come up with a clever dis。 That's rat battling。😡。

It even happens in like a break dancing battle or things like that。 same kind of thing， right。

 So the guy who's more certain in himself， Okay， the person that's more certain in himself。

We'll have it where they。They're able to say nice and loose。

 So let's say that you're talking to somebody who you want to attract in your dating life。

 And the other person comes up and tries to compete with you。 when you say nice and loose。

And you're indifferent and chill。 And then they lose their cool。

 They'll shut down and they blow themselves out。 It happens all the time。 It also means like。

 if I can stay like this as a teacher or a guru， when other teachers will dis me online。

 which happens to me all the time。 I just say super loose and chill。

 keep coming out with great content， I I keep banking and they keep suffering。😡。

And they body themselves in effect。 Thiss happened for years。 People who tried for years。

 never pulled it off， never。So what do I know that they don't， Simple， Re after me。

 control muscle versus release muscle。😡，什么。Now， a meta level point that I want to make。

 as I show you the exercise for this， is that my， okay， so there's things that I know for a fact。

And then there's things that I know subjectively and are more in the realm of opinion。

 So would you guys mind if I give you an opinion right now。Okay。

 I actually do believe that there's a battle between good and evil energies in the world going on under the surface。

 I believe it。 Okay， like the Jei type thing from Star Wars。 Okay， the light side of the dark says。

 I believe this。This is just purely speculative， okay， but I I could， you give me a week。

I convince you but。We don't have a week。 So what I think happens。

Is that there's dark energies that are controlling people and their main goal is to make the world fester。

 they want to do two things。 What is they want to put everybody in perpetuity in their control muscle all the time。

😡，The other is they want that negativity to build and to fester。

 Why have we seen an attack on comedy in recent years with political correctness， In my view。

 it is an evil， dark energy that doesn't want people to tease each other because what happens when we tease each other。

 We laugh， We have fun， We don't take ourselves seriously， We get over ourselves。

 What is the purpose of teasing。 What is it。😡，Is it to hurt someone's feelings and insult them， No。

 what is the purpose of comedy or teasing。It's to talk about 10 subjects that there's tension around that could trigger somebody。

 make light of it， make it funny， make us take ourselves less seriously。😡，And get over it。

 Let me give an example。 My firstborn son， Vincent， is autistic。 Now， when you hear that， are you。

 do you feel really bad for me。You should actually， if I heard someone's son as autistic。

 I'd feel very bad for them。 It's very expensive。 There's a lot of careta。

 There's a lot involved in that。😡，You should feel bad for me， but here's the thing。You're like， okay。

 But here， but here's the thing。 If you come to me and you go like this， Owen。I know your son。

 Vincent has autism， and I am so sorry， and I want to let you know。

 I will never call him a retard because I will never， I'm like， you know， I'll feel worse。

 But what if we just joke about it， What if we have fun with it and joke about it and make it where when I see Vincent flap in his arms around。

 I start laughing。That's how I get over it。😡，But yet， in today's society。

 they want to stop that kind of thing。 Why I believe， in my view。

 it's an evil energy that wants to get so much pent up tension that it explodes and people harm each other。

 That's why they don't want people to tease and have fun。They want to separate us。 That's what it is。

 Joking and teasing is meant to make us have more fun and to laugh。

 So they take the most sensitive groups， and they make it where you can never tease them or never joke them。

 You're always on eggs shows around them。 And then what they do is they make it weird because you can't joke。

 They feel weird。 you feel weird and you never come together。If you want to bring people together。

 you use teasing。 you use fun。 And here's why It comes back to what I said， control versus release。

 teasing。 what is teasing， Is it in the control muscle or the release muscle。

 What is being triggered， What you're trigger warning， what is being triggered。😡。

What is that You're trying to be in control。 No， my son's autistic。 I'm mad about it。

 I can't handle it。 I can't change it。 no， you made fun at me。😡，Silence him， he made fight。

 silence him。Okay。Thatice I gay， right now， if I silence him， well， what is that going to do。

 I that going to make it where I can't， I that going to fix my problem is being more in control and just controlling everything。

😡，Is that going to fix it。 No， this is what the release muscle for。 Now， again。

 getting into the subjective， which I can't prove， but I believe what I'd also say is that in release。

 we access a higher power。 And in that higher power， many of these things resolve themselves。

 Like I'm going bald。 So that would be bad because it means I could never meet a girl， right。

 I've never going to meet a girl because I'm going bald。 No girl will ever like me。 Now。

 I can try to like somehow go crazy over it and hide it and all that kind of stuff。😡。

And it's still going to be a problem。 Or I cannot not care as soon as I don't care。 You know。

 what's weird。The problem goes away。Little weird， right， The problem doesn't matter。 Look。

 there's two types of short guys。 There're short guys that care that they're short。

 And that's called a creepy short guy。 Then there's short guys that don't care。 Look at Jeff。

 He's 5 foot，7。 Ds incredible women。😡，He doesn't care。Is Jeff a short guy， Well， he's short。

 but he's not a short guy。 Why， what's the reason。He's in release about it。 He's in release to that。

That's it。 Elliot Hallst，5 F 8。 You think of him as 6 with4。I think I'm slightly taller than Elliot。

 I mean， that's weird。I thought he'd be 9 feet tall。 So when you don't care， it doesn't matter。 like。

 look what happened in Julie in the media。If Julian cares about that， that he's a victim。

 If he doesn't care， he goes on with his life， it's a known issue。

So it just depends whether you care or you don't care。 I mean， look at the book the game。

 You you guys ever read the book the game by Neil Strauss， I mean。

 could you see a reality or if you had a book that sold millions of copies ripping you to shreds。

 You'd never want to leave your house again。Now， what if I had to tried to control that。

 and then I stayed in my house all the time， and then you saw me 10 years later。

 I kind of come out of my house。😡，And I'm all weird about it。 You're like， oh。

 that's that guy in the game。 He got a bad rap。 weird。 But what if I don't care at all。

 You know what's weird about that。If I don't care at all， nobody else cares。 In fact。

 if I don't care at all and you watch my videos。You probably look at that portrayal and you're like。

 what was that about， That's weird。That's all you're thinking。 So it's release versus control。

That's why when you're meeting somebody， if you're talking to them and you're in release。

 but that other person comes up to compete with you and they're in control。

 they will never win from that paradigm。 What you're doing is when you go into release。

 you're tapping into a higher power。 Now， again， last thing on speculation。

 and then we're going to lay into this。😡，Some people in religion or spiritual ideas would say that releasing is a surrender to a higher power。

 So when you're in control， that implies separation right， say you talk about Satan as an example。

 Okay， as a archetype。 What is Satan's big thing that he has。 Again， this is just speculation。

 I'm not teaching a religious belief here。 Just speculate。

 I'd like to teach you to think about these things in your own way。

 So rather than think about it in the way I teach， why don't you just like look at this as an example of some creative thinking and then make your own opinion on it would be my suggestion。

 Don't listen just to me。😡，What is it that Satan， what separated him from the kingdom of God。

 what is it， I don't know even a Christian， by the way， but what separate him， He want to be special？

He wanted to be about himself。 So that need to be special。That need is in the control muscles。 Now。

 notice that the further that we need to be special and better and superior。

 the more that we're going into that dark， dense energy， the control muscle， right。😡。

Versus when we surrender to God and we just let it move through us now what happens is you're naturally gonna want to be friendly。

 You're naturally going to want to help people。 You're naturally going to want to add value。

 You're naturally going to want to be ethical and moral。

 You're gonna naturally you're not gonna to need to be taught like a sheep。

 Don't steal What you're gonna to say to release and surrender。

 The last thing you want to do is go punch somebody or hurt somebody or steal something。

 So that need to be kind of tyrannical to control the people。

 It's like you put them in control muscle。 Then you pump down their sense of status through comparison。

 Then you boss them around and tell them what to do。 They can't think straight。

 And the whole system's a mess。😡，A mess and life just passes them by in this Drp state While society has 5% of its intellectual capital and energy being accessed。

 And that's why we're in a scarcity。 That scarcity mindset alone is half the problem。 Craz stuff。

 right， This's kind of getting kind of crazy。Okay， so let's get off the crazy。 Now。

 going back to understanding how to operate at an elite level。 Okay， at a paradigm shift。

So right now， most of you can't just come up with things to say off the tip of the tongue。

 You don't know how to do it。 I'm going to show you how to do it。 Okay， I'm going show you how to do。

 I'm going to get you doing it。 So right now， your control muscle is so jammed up。

 It's like you're squeezing your butt and can't take a crap。😡，And you need to take a crap so bad。

So if you want to take a crap， how do you do it， you just let go， Yeah， let go。

Now the way you do that。😡，As a first exercise， we're going to call this the magic eight ball exercise。

😡，So if I tell you to come up with random words， what you're going to do is you're going to think really hard。

 You're going to think really hard。😡，We're going to get off that。Instead。

 what we're going to do is we're going to release。😡，Now， notice that when I'm speaking。

 if I want to emphasize a word， I'm going to go extra release。 Like if I want to yell。

 if I want to yell to the back of the room， but I do it the way you do it。

 I will throw my voice out 100%。😡，Hundred%， I'm like， yeah， I'm not even willing to do what you do。

Because if I did， the seminar， I' will end。Is bad。 Okay， so the more power that I want to put out。

 the more I have to release， the more creative the more creative I want to be。

 I have to try less and not try to try less because that's still trying。😡。

That's a mind screw for you there， too， right， Okay， if I do that， I've got， I've got a release。

 I've got to full He just release。 You guys remember yesterday when I did a little dance。

 you remember that。😊，You remember I did the dance。 I was imitating him and I did the dance。

 How do I do that， The way I come up with a random dance for like five minutes and each thing is funny。

 improvised is I have to completely let go。 And then I'm watching my body doing this。 I'm like。

 this is hell funny。 And I'm just watching my body do it。

 Okay because in the same way that you can create a dream。 You can create a dance。

 You can create content for social media。 You can create marketing pieces。

 You can create it off the fly。 So I'm showing you here creativity on steroids。😊。

So the base of this to understand it is the magic a ball exercise。 Now， here's what I'm going to do。

 So what we're going to do is we're going to associate different words and in associating these different words。

There's only two rules。 The first rule， and I'll explain it in more detail。 Don't worry。

 you'll get it。 The first rule is you cannot associate from the previous word。 So you can't say blue。

 red， green， yellow， purple。 my little kid could do that。 Any that's not an exercise。 That's a joke。

 okay。😡，So don't go， don't go 1，2，3，4，56 know， don't go America， Canada， Mexico。

 South America don't do that。 don't associate out the previous word。 If you catch yourself doing it。

 be aware of it， don't self-attack and just move on。

 The next one is don't associate from the environment Don't go floor red， know purple speaker light。

 don't do that either again that's what my kid does Like oh he knows what a light is don't do that。

 a kid can do that So what you're gonna do is you're gonna completely relax and you're simply gonna let words come to you like a magic eight ball that you shake and you let it come up。

 shake， let it come up， shake， let it come up and just let it come up。 So I'll do it right now。

 It's super simple。😡，That's。Beach。Mountain。Cloud。Opinion。Lightning。Now I see I associate they at tad。

 you'll do the same thing， but if you do just move off it don't go like， wait。

 restart just we're good， okay。😡，Yeah。Utah。Like again， where' does that come from， I don't know。

Garfield。The speed of sound。Rush。Rock。Now， notice in release 2， do you see when I start releasing。

 Do you see my smile muscles compulsively going up， Did you guys notice that， too。

 When you go and release your， Do you remember ER told the power now， you remember that。

Your happiness is your default state， when you go in release， you start getting like euphoric。

 it's trippy。😡，Yeah， but look what happens in society， guys。You're continually put in control。

 you're miserable。 then you think you need to reach a certain goal to be happy。

Do you see how toxic the social conditioning is？And by the way， if we all made more money from it。

 that maybe we could justify， but what society is at a loss because of this。

And a lot of dark forces are in place right now， meant to hold it here。Pose。Whites。Piano， okay。

 you see what's happening there。 So the reason why。 So what I'm doing when I'm public speaking。

Or doing say free tours or videos。 And I want to be able to come up with it at a fast rate。

 is I'll be walking to my shooting location。 And my staff will always say the same thing like。

 what are you going to talk about， I'm like， I don't know， No， but really， you don't even know， Nope。

 don't know。 You don't know， I don't nope。It'll even be to the point I'm like， stop asking。

 you going to wreck it。You know， that's like if you're going hook up with your girlfriend。

 She's like， so how are we going do it today， You're like， wellll figure it out， okay。It's like。

 well， this way hey you know， that's weird。So I might have a general idea at time。

 sometimes if I'm really tired， I'll rely on something prepared if I'm just so tired。

 but it's never as good。 So let the mind go into relaxation now。

Moment of meta level understanding of this， but then we'll go back to practical。In release。

 what you're doing， in my view， is you're tapping into your higher power。 Okay。

 don't take this from me。😡，I would only ask of you to be curious about what I'm saying and verified it in your own life。

😡，What I'm saying is when you go into release and you have trust。Certain things change。

 Here's what they are。 What is that your changes。 You guys all know what Rs is Re our activation system。

 You need to Google that。 Okay， so that's one thing。 you have trust， okay。😡。

You're going to see things you couldn't normally see。😡，But also。

 you're going to tap in energetically to where other energies are attracted to you。

You're going to shift energetically。 like energy is attracted like energy。

 If you're in a negative state， you'll tend almost like a magnet to attract these weird pendulums。

 Have you guys read reality transfering。Do you guys know， have you read that by Vim， Luke。

 have you read that， by the way， That's the number one book I'd say for you and Tim to read。

 by the way。 The idea of it is Ed。 Okay， again， is that weird woo woo， like kind of half。

 half true like。Yeah， okay， solid， Okay， so it's like。

It's's like it's like the woo woo way thinking about a phenomenon。

 But the idea of it is that we have energetic pendulums。

 So one person charges the pendulum and then kind of shoot it over， and then that charges。

 and they shoot it back。 So that's， in my opinion，'re like in politics right now， we're seeing like。

 like， what are we seeing in politics， like late term abortion。 And then like you know， on the left。

Right like some of this is like， whoa， but then at the same time， we see states like no abortion。

 right so you see what's happening right like this pendulum， right。

 And it's funny like a lot of my female friends in L when they had。

 what's to say with no abortion recently， they made it like no abortion thing。Yeah， Alabama。

 like my female friend。 A lot of them are like， you know， starlets， So they're， they're like full。

 like liberal， and they're like。I can't believe this。 I can't even sleep at night。 I'm。

 I'm I I I haven't slept in days。 I'm crying for these women right。 But then at the same time。

 look at the right wing people， they see late from abortion， which is like。And。

And they're freaking out。 like they can't even sleep， right。 Well， look what's happening。

 This negative energy。 But by the way， all the right wing people don't get it that when you just completely attack abortion overall。

 then the left is gonna be like， yay， late term。 And then likewise， when you get rid of abortion。

 they're gonna to do late It's like， I mean， I may not this again。

 is getting out of my core competency It's just kind of little theory because I read a book。

 I read reality transfering。 that's kind of how he would explain it。

 But what did you guys notice in politics are you guys watching the Democratic debates。 Okay。

 are you seeing how much is getting like how Trump got like like not ultra right wing。

 but got like he's very like not politically correct now they're getting super politically's getting polarized。

 You guys seeing this， there's other reason this is happening。

 including the algorithm and many other reasons。 But essentially what you're seeing is the building of a pendulum。

 It's shooting back and forth。 And the pendulum is beginning to accelerate。

 Okay It's beginning to accelerate。 So people what's happening is they're getting an energy。

 and they're kind of。😡，Geting they're getting swept up in this pendulum。

 and they're being moved energetically， okay。How do you think you get out of that pendulum。

 what is the way to get out of the pendulum？Go into your release muscle。 Okay。

 go into your release muscle。 What you want to do， You don't want to be getting pulled in these weird。

 negative directions that are combative。 Sometimes that's life。 Maybe you have to sometimes。

 but that's not what you want is your default。 And instead， you want to transcend it。

 So when somebody insults you， you want to be at the point where you have such little reaction that they look dumb。

😡，Because when somebody insults you， what are they trying to do to you？

They're trying to engage you in a pendulum， right， back in the day when I teach dating， you know。

 maybe a girl would test， a girl would give you a test。

 And we would always think the way to beat the test。In the longer term。

 what do you think we realize is the best way to beat a test。 You're like， cool。

 And then you just keep talking。Best way to be to test。It's hilarious。 So for the exercise。

That's the meta。 I want to teach you to tap into your release muscle。 So this is a very。

 very simple way to tap into your release muscle， okay。

When you can tap into this and you know when to exercise it the way that it will be for you is the control muscle is like your paddle。

 okay sometimes you need the control muscle。 it's like a paddle but other times with the release muscle it's like your sail with the sale。

 what you do is you just throw up the sail then that jet stream of wind comes along and then all you have to do is just move the rudder So in release。

 you're still doing something just like moving a rudder。

 you're doing something but it's a lot less than paddling but why do we still want to have those control muscles for the same reason we want to have a paddle because sometimes just because you went and release the shit ain't gonna to get handled sometimes you just got a paddle buddy it is what it is So all aim to be in my control muscle maybe 25% of the day and in a release maybe 75% of the day okay but I'm not so much in release that I'm like Ehartll looking like sitting on a park bench doing nothing。

😡，Okay。So， you know， or maybe it's even 50，50， but you get the idea。 But here's the problem。

 Why am I going to emphasize release muscle today and not control why。What do you think everyones。

 Yeah， you're being overly pounded in the control muscle all the time。

 You're not even used to releasing。 Okay， you're not even used to it。 by the way。

 when we do energetic releasing on Sunday， watch what happens when we let go of energy by showing you how to energetically release it。

 Watch how your perception， Like just the way you even see the room changes the way you see other people changes how your awareness changes is freaky。

 It is really freaky。 But you're gonna learn that at a core level this weekend。 Let's go now。

 though back on public speaking。 So what we'll do right now is go take a group of say three people each。

 Okay，3 each。 And each take turns for about two minutes。

 clear your mind and just let whatever word comes up comes up and here's the main key。

 Don't judge it。 Don't judge what you're saying。Do I look like I'm judging what I'm saying that much？

Don't judge what you're saying if you're judging it， what are you trying to do？

You're trying to control it。 Okay， So you've got to just get used to just like。

 because what will happen when you release， Here's what's going to happen。As you release。

 you're going suddenly get very happy。 You're going to feel really peaceful， really good。

 And things are just going to come to。 You're not going to have to try as hard。

 It's just going to come to you， but it's going to take a minute because you're going to want to control it。

 You're all those old habits are still there， It's like it's like。😊，Planin。volcano， right。

 You're going' to want to do it。 So just allow， okay， say the art of allowing。Okay。

 so you've been in control most of your life。 cool， so cool。

 We're just gonna try something different now。 Okay， so grab your group with three。

 Let's do it for about 2，3 minutes。 each It'll be about a 10 minute exercise。

 And then we're gonna come back， okay。😊，Let's do it。其实啊真正的力量啊是源于释放的。当我们学会放下控制，相信我们的自由流动的时候。

其实我们就进入了一种更加轻松愉快啊，创造性十足的一种状态。这种释放的状态，可以让我们接触到更高的力量和能力啊，帮助我们去超越自己的一种局限性啊，活出最好的自己。

你们记得课程里说的这个魔术8号球的一个练习酶。它就是生动的啊展示了如何进入释放的一个状态。关键是啊要放空自己的一个思绪，让我们的联想呢自然浮现，而不是去判断或者是控制他们。

当我们不再执着于特定的结果的时候啊，不再去强求思维按既定的模式去运作的时候，我们的创造力才会得到解放。意想不到的一些灵感啊，就会涌现。其实过度控制带来。的危害就是当人们执着于特定的立场。

试图啊将自己的观点强加于别人的时候，往往会引起更多的冲突和对立。就像一个钟摆，他的摆伏越大啊，双方的情绪就越极端，人们就越难以达成理解和共识，假设你正在和一个你想吸引的人交谈啊，此时此刻。

另外一个人过来试图想跟你去竞争。当你跟这个人交谈的时候啊，很随意而不用去关心啊那个过来竞争者的时候啊，你表现的越是沉着冷静。那么那位竞争者呢就会自取其辱。而当我们学会释放啊。

不再被外界的评判和情绪所牵引的时候，我们就能够超越这种对立，去化解这种矛盾，然后创造一种双赢的局面，学会释放的，并不意味着完全放弃控制。🎼像航行啊需要翻和桨一样，我们生活中啊有时候需要主动掌控。

而有的时候呢需要顺势而为，关键是我们如何去找到二者的一种平衡。在合适的时机使用合适的方式。当我们放下对结果的执念，去用开放的心态去拥抱自己的时候，我们自然而然就能够激发自己的一个潜能。一个人的觉醒啊。

一次真挚的表达，也许就能开启一场连锁的反应来唤起更多的自由觉醒的本质是从思想形式转换为察觉的存在状态。你对结果的执念是什么呢？欢迎大家踊跃思考啊，在群里面进行交流。我是社交光谱莱特啊，更多的精彩内容。
