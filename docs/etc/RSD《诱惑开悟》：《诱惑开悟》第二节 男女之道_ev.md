# RSD《诱惑开悟》：《诱惑开悟》第二节 男女之道_ev

Let's discuss the notion of men， what it means to be a man today。We all know something has changed。

Society has changed for men and for women。Invention of the pill 40 years ago sparked the sexual revolution and gave us all the sexual freedom that we have and enjoy today。

We all， both men and women feel this is a good thing。But deep down， we can't shake the feeling。

That we might have lost something vital along the way。As a result。🎼Men today feel lost。

Marriage doesn't seem to work anymore。Women and men simply don't get invested as deeply today as they once did。

Intentionions and noble dreams are sky high， and yet all around us we see the smoking wreckage of relationships。

A man who is just recovering from the destruction of his marriage or relationship is terrified。

Of the notion of trying to navigate the dating waters of society today。

Everywhere I go the message I hear from men is the same。

 they are confused and not sure exactly how to approach today's woman。

 let alone date her or have a relationship with her。A lot of men， unfortunately。

 are becoming more and more bitter。More sad and more jaded because of their fundamental confusion。

Missogyny runs ramp。Not necessarily overt， of course。

 but simmering beneath the surface in a very large number of men today。Our traditional roles。

🎼That of provider and protector。Have been virtually negated。For a variety of reasons。

For thousands of years， women have needed men to have those roles to be their providers and protectors for thousands of years。

While today's woman is demonstrated and she is perfectly capable of providing for herself。

 thank you very much。And perfectly capable of protecting yourself in today's society。

Men feel they are gradually losing their utility。🎼To women。So what's that？

It feels like there is no longer someone for everyone。There is no longer a lid for every pot。

Society today makes it so that a few get a lot。And some get none。Sounds pretty discouraging， right？

What do women need us for anyway？🎼Well。The answer is a good one。Women still need us。

To celebrate them。They can't live without it amidst all this confusion。

 despite the fact that today's welcometon has been raised on women's magazines。

Magazines that are dedicated to putting men in their motives under a microscope。

 in spite of all the warnings from their somewhat bitter and jaded girlfriends。

In spite of all the media。Talk shows。Woman remains。🎼At heart。🎼A female。Waiting for guys like you。

Women still want to be seduced， they love intrigue， I say this all the time。

 but it's true women are complicit in their own seduction， they want it more than you do。

Every woman wants to be in a love story。The man who realizes this one simple truth。Reizes everything。

A woman is complicit in her own seduction and a man who understands this。

Is forever surrounded by beauty。So in today's society， men have lost their way。

 we no longer know how to be men。We simply can't understand the dating scene。

Everything our fathers told us no longer applies。We're not sure if we should open the door for her。

 if we should pay。We should wait two days before we calls， we don't appear needy or is it three。

 we don't know anymore， should we be sensitive and consider it？Sharing our feelings with others。

With other men。Crying， crying often。Or should we steal ourselves against the vagaries of life？

Shouldhodering our burden as men with a resolute。And silent determination。This whole notion。

 the whole notion of manliness， of masculinity。Has been modified， made more sensitive。

 more politically correct， more blended， more safe， more manageable。More feminine。

And women everywhere are losing faith， they're wringing their hands at the lack of real men in the world。

The whole idea behind the equality movement is that men and women are to recognize that they are equal。

But somewhere， it got warped into the notion that men and women should become the same。

The ridiculous notion that there is no difference between the genders。

 men and women today are blending， our roles are overlapping。We are becoming the same。But not equal。

 that was the goal， the goal was equality， the result is sameness。There's the problem。Now。

 the multibillion dollar self help industry has missed men completely。The reason for this is simple。

 it ignores what rings true to men。It is all about changing external things about him his appearance。

 his environment， etc。But not his essence。Not his presence。Not his core。

In our interactions with women， if we only concentrate on external tactics and techniques。

 the external things。We miss the only thing about is that women will really respond to and one of the fundamental things that men are missing today。

Is the very notion of manliness， what it means to be a man women are looking for and can't find it。

Men today have a secret fear of women why？Because we realize we think she has all the power。

 most men feel they need a woman to validate them， to prove to themselves that someone out there can find them attracted。

But if it is true。That the majority of men createa validation from a woman。

Then the converse must also be true， she also has the power to invalidate him to reject him。

This stops men in their tracks， scares them to their very core。

 and they begin to resent this power that women have over them。How did we get this way。

 what has changed？Why is it so difficult？As we all know。

 dating and relationships have devolved into a series of manipulation in mind games in a contest of wills。

There's a kind of mean spirit that permeates relationships today。As men。

 we are increasingly apprehensive and unsure。Masking our fundamental desires for the sake of political correctness and quite frankly。

 for our own sanity， we have to。This is because in today's dating world。

 if you state your desire for her。Too enthusiastically， you lose。So instead。

 we learned that we must be aloof and act uncaring and cool。

When what we you really want to say is you excite me and I can't wait to see you again。

We really do want to say that to a woman who delights us， but we can't。We've become too sensitive。

 too cautious， too afraid， too aloof。🎼And too detached。

I am completely unrestrained with women and having enormous fun。

 I am a slave to my love of women and they can sense it。The weakness of women's language and words。

Fortunately， this is one of my strong points。And I act like they are from Mars if they try to repel my advances。

 like it doesn't make any sense。So I'll say like， come out with me for a drink tonight。

 I'll pick you up at seven。I can't， my boyfriend wouldn't like it。Oh hey， I understand。

 let's make it eight then。That's an example of the kind of thing I would say to a girl。

 keep it fun and light。Or this。I would say，You know what， you're kind of cute。

 you have the second nicest eyes I've ever seen， you'd make a good girlfriend for me。

 I think I'm going to call you。Well you think so do you， of course。

I'm going to call you Tim more on night way by the phone。I never。

 ever worry about a woman's resistance to me。If she says she is not interested in leaves。

 no problem I understand， I respect that， but if I ever see her again， I immediately go up to her。

 smile and wink and pick up right where I left off as if she had never resisted me in the first place。

In other words， your boyfriend objections or whatever mean nothing。So I to go up to her again。

 and I just hear her again I'm a big smile I'm like， hellello sweetie， did you miss me。

 thinking hardly？"，II want to see you， tell me your number and I don'll remember it。No。

 I told you last time I have a boyfriend。Oh， so you're still seeing Norman。His name is not Norman。

I smile and me and go， reallyally， it's very interesting。You know。

 I have two bottles of champagne at home。No thanks。Yeah， I had two bottles。

 one to drink and one to pour all over your body。This will get her laugh and you should say。

You never give up to you。And I will say， of course not。Wouldn't be the same if I did now， would it？

No， I suppose not。But that's just me， that's how I interact with women， I keep it fun and light。

Because it's fun。You know， it used to be that fathers and sons lived together for many years in close proximity。

 doing and learning together， trying and failing together。Fathers generally had a trade。

 a skill that was learned over many years。And sons would spend a lot of time with their fathers learning the same tray。

Watching as they worked。Of course the son did not always follow in his father's footsteps。

 he often eventually chose a very different profession。

But none of that mattered because the key was the close connection they shared in those formative years。

The son trying to emulate his father。And learning what it means to be a man。

We have largely lost that today， there are fewer trades and more cubicles。

There are fewer homes today where the father is present at all， either physically or emotionally。

Most husbands and wives have split up， remarried， become single parents， or moved away。

 there are all kinds of configurations。And permutations。

Even the homes where the fathers are physically there。

 they are hardly ever involved in any meaningful way in their son's life。

Modern man comes home from the office to his wife and his stepchildren。

Helps out around the house somewhat。And then collapses in front of the television。

He is a rare man today who spends time with his son。He is either not there at all or too distracted。

Too busy。Of course， this is a generalization。But true in an increasingly large number of households。

The result is a generation of men， our generation。That has been raised largely by women。

And her mother wants her son to be safe。A father will build a jump for his son's bike。

 and mother would never allow it。A father will teach his son to hunt and fish。

 a woman is not interested in that。A father will teach a son to go out there and try to win。

 a mother will teach him that competition is bad。That everyone should win。And so today。

We are surrounded by boys who grew up to be men that a woman would create。He is kind， considerate。

 safe， moderate。Sensitive。But lacking an edge and a strength。That his father would have given him。

Hes lacking something fundamental that women need and crave in a man。

This is a big reason why women today are so uninspired by the choice they have in men out there。

And the cycle feeds itself and gets worse。And this is the essence of the nice guy in the dating world today these are the guys。

Who either didn't have any kind of a father at all。Or whose fathers were dominated by their wives。

 Of course， the extreme opposite of the nice guy is the jerk。We all know guys like that。Well。

 believe it or not。Both the nice guy and the jerk。Are created by the exact same shaping influence。

 the lack of a father figure that they respected。In their formative years。

One takes a path of submissiveness， believing that women will not like him if he doesn't cater to them。

And attempts to show that he will do anything for them。The nice guy。

 this is what they watched their father do。The other bears in his heart fear and a faint hatred of women in general。

 he never saw a man respecting a woman as he was growing up。

 or he felt dominated and manipulated by his mother。Generation after generation。

 fathers handed down wisdom to their sons。This is how you be a man， this is how you wield an axe。

 this is how you treat a woman。Men were masculine， women were feminine。

This model of handing down the wisdom of the ages from father's son worked very well。

Right up until about。30，40 years ago。Our generation。

Our grandfathers received knowledge from their fathers， et cetera， et cetera。

Open the door for a lady son， take charge。Well when our grandfathers and fathers tried to hand down the same guidebook to us。

The navigational charts on how to be a man and how to treat a woman。Our ships。Hit rocks。

And ran aground。But it has been the model for thousands of years in every society， the Greeks。

 the Romans。Information has always been crucially passed from fathers to sons。Until now。

For the first time in history， it has all changed。That's why men feel lost。

It is different today than it has ever been， we live in a world where either we had no fathers to tell us how to be men。

Or if we did。We discovered that none of the instructions they gave us applies in the dating world today。

 it's all different。Again， this is a very simple way of describing something that is extremely complex and it's merely my take on things I'm not a psychoanalyst。

There are many different influences that we observed and experienced growing up。

 all of it contributed to who we are today。But the essence of what I'm saying here is true。

 the lack of a proper role model father in our life is something that society today has lost。

I believe that the loss of our fathers or the lack of approval of our fathers or the loss of respect for our fathers。

🎼Is by far the biggest reason we have dysfunction。🎼In our relationships。🎼With women。

It is why we can't get a date， is why a woman will not trust us with her body。

 is why we can't keep her。It is why we put her on a pedestal， it is why they don't respect us。

 it is why we mistreat and abuse her。It is why we are jerks to her。

It is why we are so unfulfilled and so lost today。We are a generation of wounded men。

All of us have unhealed wounds。Our fathers intentionally or unintentionally shot a metaphorical arrow into our heart。

When we were young， sure， we have broken off the shaft of the arrow。

 and the skin has long since closed over the wound。But we have never truly healed。

 we still have the arrowhead inside of us that first pierrcce us。Rather。

 we have defined our lives around our wounds and the process of accepting them。

And there is no answer out there in the multibillion dollar self help industry for men。All the books。

 all the programs， all the scharron and misguided dating advice。All the television shows。

The talk shows。Have failed men miserably， men have lost away and they see no help。

This is why there is a new man's movement offoot。It is relatively new。

Created not by relationship gurus， we've always had those， men and women who give dating advice。

 who try to teach men how to have more meaningful relationships。Men today。

Have recognized it all for what it is。🎼Bushshit。doesnn't apply today。

What our fathers never told us or told us badly is the biggest reason that we no longer know how to relate to women。

And that includes you。You have a wound。The difference with you and others is that you recognize there is something lacking in your soul are tired of it。

And are taking steps to change it。Essentially what we are all sharing with each other today。

Is the talk our fathers never gave us。Women know what you're all about right away。

Within a few seconds， she's already categorized you。

 she does this with every man she meets for her whole life。There's five boxes that women have。

There's either this box over here and she puts every man in one of these boxes right away within a few seconds。

 you're in one of those boxes when you meet a girl。The one over here。He， that guys kind of creepy。

 I don't like him at all， you're in that box， This box over here is neither they're here nor there。

 just a guy I don't I'm thinking anything about him at all。There's that box。

This box here is that guy's a nice guy， I mean he would make a nice friend for me。The fourth box。

🎼Is long term potential。 I really like this guy。 I might be able to get something from this guy long term。

 So I have to play my cards right and be discreet and very nice and kind and around him。😊。

The fifth box is I would like to sleep with that guy。

You were in one of those boxes with every girl you know。

Every single one and it's very difficult to get moved from one box to the other。

She puts you in one all of those boxes immediately， all women have the same rating system。

So who are these creatures that inhabit the earth called women？

Men today have the viewpoint that it is us over here and them over there。

So many men view women as some kind of enemy， like a force to be conquered or overcome。

 the dating and relationship scene is viewed as some kind of a struggle or epic battle。

Men are over here， arrayed on a hill， staring helplessly。A cross an abyss of silence at women。

In their walled and imposing fortress。We gather in our trenches and we draw up elaborate strategies and ingenious plans to find a way to effectively breach their walls。

Men sometimes try a direct assault。Finding themselves dodging a rainstorm of arrows and boiling oil for if anything。

 women are very skilled at defending against a direct attack。So we retreat and lick our wounds。

 surely there must be a better way。So we try sending out scouts。

 we try to intercept and disrupt their female communications to understand them and when we do。

We work feverishly through the night trying to break their codes。You've heard about chick logic。

 paying attention to what she does， not what she says， that's code breaking。When that doesn't work。

Some in our ranks， some men suggest that maybe we should become spies， you know。

 act like we are not the enemy， that our intentions are not to gain access to the forress。

 we just want to hang around outside the walls， we want to be friends。

We have no interest in actually entering。We're content to just wander around outside as long as she allows us to remain close。

 well give her rides everywhere we do all these things。She， of course， allows it。

And doesn't attack us with her arrows because she feels her intentions are just that we only want to be friends。

 that's what we tell her。But her intentions are not just that this is a secret attempt to tunnel underneath her walls。

We hope she is lulled into a false sense of safety。🎼Our intentions are。Entirely noble after all。

 but when she isn't looking。We are sure working hard to burrow our way under the walls， is it war？

Is that a rather harsh way of describing it？Not to a lot of men。

 they really feel like they have seen combat， their war stories about their battles with women。

Our legion。But there was a different way。There are some men who can ride up to her walls， solitary。

Who approach your gaze directly， honestly？And openly。I am not your enemy， I am not going to hurt you。

 I am not about to attack you， I am on your side， let me in。And guess what？🎼She does。

She opens her gate willingly and lets him in，This is where you want to be。

🎼You want to be a friend to women。Not her enemy。You know， 150 years ago， Thorau wrote。

The mass men live lives of quiet desperation。This is as true today as it was back then。

How many men look out the window and wonder where it all went？

Why the world hasn't provided him with what he always dreamed about。

We grew up in a world that didn't look anything like the world we really wanted to grow up in。

You know， we wanted epic adventures and what did we get， two weeks vacation。

 we wanted a mission and what did we get。Alan then needs mowing。

We wanted a purpose and we got a cubicle。We wanted a beautiful dams zone and we got a jaded career women。

 we wanted a noble steed， we ended up with a minivan。We wanted a castle and we got a mortgage。

 we wanted a wisdom。And we got insipid talk shows。We wanted to treasure， and what did we get？

Andlist that。Imagine if you will， you ideal woman。Most of us have this image already in us。

It is the girl that would make us happy forever。If only we could find her。

It might be someone you know or have known in your past。He might be a film star。

You might be a completely fictitious woman， maybe conjured up in books you have read。

Or maybe there isn't a lot of substance to her at all。

 maybe shes just your overarching concept of womanness。🎼A composite image。Think of it like this。

She is the woman that would make you forget every other woman。

If you could just have her in your life。She is the woman that would make it unnecessary for you to be listening to me talk about this right now。

She is the woman that would finally finally make you happy， make you inspired。

She's the one you would love your friends to see you with。

Walking into a club or a party with her on your arm。

How would you feel the whole time you would feel this intense level of coffins？

Because she is with you。And nobody else。At the party。What you have just imagined is the image。

🎼Of your ideal woman。We all have that in us。A lot of you have conquered the business world。

 have great friends， have cool things you like to do as hobbies。But you don't yet have her。

This woman that you imagine。You see formed in each of us in our earliest years is our personal version of the ideal woman。

 no one has the same image in mind。Here's a poem I wrote。🎼妄想的人。Man has only ever searched。

For three things in this world。The perfect note。The source of light。An alabaster girl。You see。

 I call this ideal woman that each of us has inside of us。The alabaster girl。

 a vision so perfect and so lovely and so complete in us and so rare。

🎼That no real woman could ever come close to approximating her。

Our alabaa girl that we all hold and cherish inside of us。Is a compilation。

Of all the traits that we desire in women。She might be vaguely similar to her mother。

Or she might not。She might be what we remember from a childhood encounter。

 like like Naviov's description of the long ago childhoodd vision of Annabelle in his book Lolita。

Plato also talked about the idea of a perfect chair。That we all have in a consciousness。

 we all know what it means， but none of us have ever seen， we have all seen chairs of course。

But what is the one perfect ideal version of the chair？We don't know。

 We have only seen approximations of it。In other words。

 we have only seen chairs with varying degrees of chairness。Nothing that is the ideal chair。

Or our ideal woman。Whatever your vision。And none of us have the same vision。IUnder this。

You will never find her， it is a search without end。

Your alabaster girl that you desire so intensely that would make the world feel whole again。

That would make you feel all again， that would make you believe in love again。

He is forever out of your reach。Over and over again， time after time。

 we might think we have found her， every girl we encountered throughout our lives。

 our latest new girlfriend or lover， the pretty girl we saw in the bookstore。

 the girl dancing so seductively on the speakers at the club， the girl across the room。

We compare every girl。To this image inside of us of our alabaster girl。

We squint and we scrutinize and we say， wow， this is her， I finally found her。

In our eagerness to convince ourselves that this new woman in our life is indeed our ideal woman。

We overlook everything about her that doesn't quite sync with that image。

That's the problem because inevitably over time， we come to realize at this latest obsession of ours。

He's really just a woman replete with faults， fears， insecurities。

It has been well said that the things you absolutely love about her when you first of fall in love that you're blinded to。

Are the things that annoy you later， you might have liked your independence。

Then later you can't stand your independence， you might have loved the fact that she was fun to take the parties。

 but later you hate that she still wants to go to parties with or without you。

You might be delighted by the fact that she likes to laugh and have fun a lot later。

You wonder why can't you just be serious for once？You see when the realization hits。

 that she is not what we had made her out to be， that she is not。Our alabaster girl。We men deal。

With it in a lot of different ways。Some men settle。And quietly dejectedly soldier your on。

They go out and have a beer with their buddies。🎼While she watches her soap。

They go quietly back and forth。And carry on with her unremarkable lives。

Some men get angry and take it out on her， either through neglect or verbal abuse or violence。

It is not her fault， that she is not what you envision her to be。And yet they blame her。

And thereafter， seek the punish her。But then there are the men few in number。

 who recognize the futile nature of that search。Who realize they will never obtain their cherished alabaster girl。

And yet they still embrace this wonderful， beautiful， but flawed woman who loves them。

 who's in his life。Realizing that even though she is not her。They are not settling at all。

And so they accept it for who she is， love her， and never get angry or disappointed at her for not being able to live up to this impossible ideal。

And this has a quiet beauty to it。The answer we seek。🎼Can never be found in a woman。You know， guys。

 concluding this section， we' are successful in business， were captains of industry。

And yet we feel more and more lost when it comes to discovering what is expected of us in the land of women。

Gaiing even a small understanding of this shifting dynamic will allow you to stand back somewhat。

 examine the way of men today。And rediscover your places at man。

It is impossible to effectively attack the creature that you created， that you desire。

We think there' is much animosity。To pick up artists， seducers， et cetera from women。

 but there is nothing to attack， we are not taking something from these women who are giving them what they do need and desire。

Women read lots of romance novels not necessarily because they desire that fantasy life more than their current life。

Would they really trade their husband and their much loved children for this alternate life of excitement and reless abandoned。

 no。But like a prisoner in a cell。With everything you need， books， food， television。

All of the amenities provided， you're comfortable， all your basic needs are fulfilled。

You still look forward to that one hour of exercise a day。

Well you might see a bird or a cloud or a little patch of grass in the tiny little cement yard。

That's what it's like for women， they still need to feel passion。And energy and life。

And man forgets because， well， because he's a man。He forgets there was a time not so very long ago when the woman who shares his life。

Was skipping through the fields of her childhood。Her dreams floating all about her like little dandelion puffs。

And oh， what dreams they were， she was going to grow up and marry a handsome prince。

I'm a white horse。liveive in a castle。She had these dreams， when was it？

That she let those dreams die。Was it when life， as life does， started to close in on her？

The world kills a woman's soul for you see as she grew and progressed through the tangle of classrooms and career choices。

 responsibilities and bills。Talk shows in women's magazines， Life。And various men。

That part of her began to get smaller and smaller。Finally suppress so deep inside of her。

That she no longer really believes。Her relationships。Castles of sand。

So carefully constructed and measured。That once seemed so promising。Wash away on the shore。

And she is sad。A little more。By the time she has reached adulthood。She has learned to be efficient。

 tough。🎼And independent。The man she is with today， once so giving， so attentive and aware， so alive。

Has become a mere caricature， one of Thorau's men of quiet desperation。She feels unappreciated。

 he takes her for granted now。Their relationship， propped up and patched。

 has devolved into a series of slow motion days。What was once vibrant and spontaneous？

Is now pedestrian。Each listless day saturated in heavy with a curious summnambulism。

And man knows in his heart the exact moment when it is too late。

When she's been neglected just a little too long。He sees but ignores all the signs。

Until suddenly he feels a jolt in his heart， and at that very moment。

 he senses in a rush of anguish that he has lost her。And everything stops。

There is nothing sadder than a man who knows his woman is slipping away。

And now there is nothing else but her。Everything that was once so important。

Is relegated to the distant corners of his consciousness。And so now he rushes out to buy a flowers。

 and now he compliments her， and now he writes her that letter。

And now he promises her all the things that he knew she wanted all along。

But she becomes more distant and disconnected in spite of。Or perhaps because of。

All his considerable efforts。Yet is too late。And she is slipping away。Women are a gift。

🎼From men to me。That's how we see it with his well meaning but clumsy and faltering hands。

 he wraps her up。In her fading hopes and dreams in a little gift box with a little bow and hands her to me or men like me。

No one ever steals your woman。She leaves her her own volition。

You see when a man comes along that can evoke even the tiniest spark of those dreams and that passion again she had as a child。

 she will follow you to the ends of the earth。She might not be connected with you in a relationship down the road。

 but when you touch a woman on that level。Where she can once again be made to feel the freedom and innocence and passion of her youth。

Throughout all of her subsequent relationships。She will think about you。And that is a gift。

I gift you gift to her。And a gift she gives to you。That ultimately is the goal。

To be a friend to women， to genuinely like them， to adore them， to celebrate them。

That's all there is。Everything else pales in comparison。

Everything else we try to do is merely an approximation of that fulfillment。Transcendent beauty。

Transcendent beauty， that is what a skilled seducer， a lover of a woman， brings out in her。

He recognizes that there is something fundamentally beautiful about women。That isn't beauty。

It's something else。So what is modern women thinking？If men today are so lost and confused。

 we explored that， what about the women？Do they have all the answers。

 do they perhaps hold all the cards， do they have the upper hand when it comes to relationships and dating？

A lot of us might think so。After all， women have all the resources。

 they have resources they can draw on wherever they turn。They have women's magazines。

Magazines that are relentless in their dedication to placing men in their motives under a microscope。

They have chickt。They have sex in the city， they have romantic comedies， they have Oprah。

 they have romance novels。They have the self help industry and they have their girlfriends。

What do men have？When it comes to relationship advice。Each other。

You know we go for a beer with our bodydy and we say， you know。

 we're broken up now and he says things like。well， plenty of fish in the sea and we say， yeah。

 you're right， that's it。That's all the self help that men have。

That's the only resource we have as our buddies。There are more singles today than any other time in history。

 we have a hookup culture today， Theres a very large pool of single men and women circulating out there。

Instead of long term commitments， very large proportions of people get together easily。

And break up just as easily。Three or five years， that's the life cycle of her relationships today。

Woe to you guys with a girlfriend who is approaching 25 years old， men have a midlife crisis。

Women have a quarter century crisis。That is a critical time in a girl's life。

 she' is turning 25 and she starts to think about her future and what she really wants for her life。

Do I still want to be a party girl or is it time and that I got serious about life？

Some of my friends are getting married and they seem happy， what about me？

I have to start thinking about kids real soon is my career choice， what I really like。

 it's not too late to change。But it soon will be too late and on and on and on。

 they think all these things， it's crisis time if you are in a relationship with a girl who hits that quarter century mark。

 put your seatbelt on because you were going for a ride。

She's going to be flaky and wistful and wondering。Thinking she should move and dreaming。

Questioning you。And questioning herself。It's just the way of women。

The age old question pondered by Freud and countless others，  what does woman want？

Wasn't there a movie with Mel Gibson called exactlyact that？As men。

 we struggle with this question immensely because women， as we know， are wired differently than us。

They flow with their emotions to such a degree。Sometimes we think even they don't know what they want。

A lot of men have the feeling today that women never think for themselves。They let society， friends。

 family， media think for them， her friends pick her boyfriend， that's what a lot of men think。

So what do women want， I'll tell you the number one thing I think women want。

They want to be seen as the beauty。Not just beautiful， but the beauty， transcendent beauty。

They want to be delighted in。They have wandered back from the time they were little girls。

Like I said。Women today have learned to be efficient。Tough and independent。And believe me。

 the air weary of this exterior。 I have a friend in New York that told me he knows a lot of very powerful women there。

I'm talking about investment bankers， real estate modelss， company presidents， CEOs， etc。

And what they have overwhelmingly told him。Is that they would give it all up for romance。

To be swept off their feet， to be delighted in。So what will women universally respond to even powerful women？

A man who will delight in her and celebrate her。A man that will awaken even the tiniest spark of that innocence and passion she had as the little girl。

That's what she wanted from her daddy， and that is what she is still seeking today。

Here's the conversation I remember， I was with a girl on her couch having a nice time。

 beautiful girl。She said to me，I really like you。But I need to get to know someone first。

 feel comfortable。To which I replied，You know， and I know。That we have been connected forever。

I am different from other guys and you know it。We have been comfortable with each other from the moment our I first met。

We are lovers。And she said， lovers。We're not lovers。We haven't even made love to each other yet。

To which I replied。Ah， that is where you're wrong， we are lovers in the truest sense of the word。

We haven't made love to each other yet。What do you think we've been doing this whole time？

Why not be a woman's fantasy， the cool thing is you can。You see。

 women are missing one thing in their lives。That romance and passion that they dream about。

 the feeling of standing too close to the edge， afraid she's going to fall off。I think it was Kra。

Who described this feeling， he said。He said， that feeling of vertigo you get when you're standing on a high cliff。

Looking over the edge。That sort of dizziness。Is not caused because you're afraid you're going to fall。

It's because you're afraid you're going to jump。Women all over are in that state constantly。

 they're afraid they're going to fall。And jump into their fantasy。So be here fantasy。

Let her feel free。And beautiful。And young and pretty again。

You can bring that out of her and be her fantasy。You know I talked earlier about how men were generally shortchaned by the fathers。

 well， so are women？There are a lot of women out there， most women。In fact。

 who are still seeking their father's approval。They have been doing this since they were little girls。

So what do women want？Yes， you will hear women say all kinds of things we say they want a man with a sense of humor。

A sensitive and caring man。And we hear how they all want the nice guy。

 someone who will finally treat them right。Tired of it， all the other guys， yeah， right。

They don't want that， I laugh at my women friends when tell me when they tell me they want the nice sensitive guy who treat them。

 say to them， you don't really want that， think about it。Within a 10 mile radius of us right now。

 there are literally hundreds of men who would do anything to be with you。

They would buy you flowers every day， they'd take you to dinner。

 they'd pay attention to you every women desire。They would be so nice and treat you so well。

 your head would spin。But you don't really want that， do you？My women friends。

 they all laugh and they agree when I tell them that。Because women don't really want the nice guy。

But they also don't want the jerk。What they want is an adventure， that's what they want。

They want for someone to take them away for a while from their humdrum， everyday existence。

It doesnn't mean to take them climbing into Himalayas， it means taking them。

🎼On an emotional adventure。Now the problem with most men。

 there was hundreds of men that live within a 10 mile radius of her。Those wonderful men。

 nice guys who would buy her anything， do anything for her， be there for her， be really sweet。

 and nice to her。Is that they would make her the adventure。And she knows it。She doesn't want them。

A woman does not want to be the adventure， she wants to be part of something larger than herself。

She wants to be taken on an adventure。She wants a man with a purpose。That isn't her。You know。

 think about why women are attracted to jerks。To dangerous men。

The reason they are is because they like that he is not focused on her。

And she makes it her project to change him。She loves the challenge。

She wants what she can't have and she can't have him。

 it's because he's too wrapped up in himself in his own drama to pay any attention to her。

One of the ironies of life is that women are attracted to the untmeable man。And when she lands him。

She tries to tame him。She tries to get him settled down to quit hanging out with his buddies to start driving a minivan。

If she succeeds， she has killed the very things in him she found attractive in the first place。

 his strength。🎼And independence。And then she decries the lack of any real men。

When women ask why there are no real men， the answer is this。You turn him into a woman， that's why。

But how' was this for an idea， what about the notion that a man can be all those things a woman says she wants？

Byies your things， walks in the park， brings her flowers， et cetera， but is still untamable。

In other words， he isn't a jerk at all， remember he delights in her。

But he never makes empty promises about forever。That is a man who is a combination of the attractive elements of the nice guy。

 as well as the attractive elements of the jerk。Makes sense。It's all in your frame of reference。

You always hear that you should never buy things for girls like flowers or gifts。

 candy we are so afraid of what is called supplication。

But you will discover that a man goes through three stages in his understanding women。

Stage number one。He's really nice， he buys dinners， movies， he gives a rides， buys flowers。

 he tries to be charming and funny， but he gets few women， he's the nice guy。Stage two。

 he backs off from buying that stuff and being too available because it doesn't work。

 and he learns not to supplicate， he gets more women at that stage。Stage three。

He buys her whatever he wants， dinners， movies， flowers， candy。Gives her rides。

 he has grown out of the stage where supplication is an issue。

 and he never thinks about it again and he gets tons of women。

It's because he isn't needy and he can do these things。Here's two scenarios。Scenario A。

 a guy buys $100 bottle champagne and pours it for a girl。He is trying to impress her。

And make himself more attractive in her eyes， he asks himself， does she like me， does she like me？

She smells this neediness， happily drinks a champagne， then goes home with someone else。Scenario B。

A guy buys $100 bottle of champagne and pours it fur a grill， same thing。

He is having fun tonight with or without her。It's like you're kind of cute。

 so come have some champagne with me。He asked himself， do I like her， do I like her？

She drinks a champagne and hopes he will include her in his fun and exciting world。Here's the key。

If you buy a drink for that hot girl there。And you can't buy a drink for the 80 year old man down at the end of the bar。

 you fail。You're missing the whole point。Most men try to buy a girl's attention to buy the relationship。

Enlighted seducers， guys who are good of women， do things for their own reasons。

He never thinks if I do this for her。Maybe she would like me better。

Most men when they meet a girl like that。A girl that they like， they constantly ask themselves。

Does she like me， does she like me， this is key， naturals enlighten light seducers。

 they ask themselves do I like her， do I like her？They are not buyers， they're sellers。The truth is。

 if a girl really likes you， there is very little you can do to screw it up。

There is a reason that the largest genre of books sold today by far are romance novels。🎼Why？

Because there is not enough passion in a woman's life。What do they want？

Every woman wants to be in a love story。That's what women want。
