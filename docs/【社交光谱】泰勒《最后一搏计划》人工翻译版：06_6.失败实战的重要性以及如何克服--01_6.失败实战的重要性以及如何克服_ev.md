Welcome to New York City and what we're going to be doing today is shooting into a video on how to beat a horrible night where you're getting rejected again and again and you're shooting into a downward spiral we're going be discussing why the downward spiral occurs Why in my experience it's the best thing that could possibly happen to you for your longter growth and exactly how to break out of it before you go though I'm not just a cigarette out with baby how do you guys hang very well actually。

I know I'm entertaining。How do you guys think of？So got it， that's cool。

 How do you know your pasta here？Do you。 highigh school no that's cute okay， well。

 I'm going to go back with my friends， we're going to go get a snack。Pleasure to meet you。嗯。

What happened， I just seasonizing what happened？给我个做。Okay， fine。

 forget it sorry dude I got zoned in onm sorry bro okay。

 wait wait wait have you ever been have you ever been into heavy bubble for two seconds I want you to think of it like when you're in the gym and the weight is just way too heavy for some reason。

You're like damn， I could normally lift this， why can't I lift this today？

 And if you power through you're gonna get bigger and you're resisting because your body doesn't want to grow。

 Well， in success with women， you'll see the same thing where right at the time where if you're powered through。

 Yeah， keep going if you do that， that is what spurs the massive massive growth in your skills of girls。

 So that being the case in this video， We're going go into why a horrible night with women happens。

 how to fix it and the benefits of powering through to the promised land of massive growth after having a horrible。

 horrible night meeting girls。 Every set is 10 out of 10。 every set。😡。

You find something funny about it。Every set you say， who the fuck on the ball do at？Now。

Some days I warm up quick。Some days I warm up slow today I gave everything I had in that seminar。

I'll probably warm up very slow， I like a bad night because you grow the most from a bad night。

So to me。What I do is I adhere to a structure and I follow that structure no matter what。

I don't care at all。Of how good I do。Not at all。We all like you good。But I don't care。

 I don't judge any set。On how well I did。I only judge it。I did I follow my game plan？Nothing else。

Firstly， I'm going to do。What I get in here？Because I'm going to open everybody。

I'm going to open the whole fucking club。What what I do care about？

I minimize time in between the sets。And I get moving。So。I want you to watch。How bad I do now。

Compared to how good I do。Later in the weekend I just see you motoring along you're just like I'm doing this I's just trying to get her back are you from Philly from Jersey Jersey and I can see something's going on there it's beautiful。

Co and weed， but is that what they said here is that you were nine people who just passed me said Co and weed Well I'm offering heroin and meth。

Herit to math。What do you think you speak with a great passion No you go Oh sorry， sorry sorry。

 Ill go， I go。Good nights。😊，Oh my gosh。Is a mouse back there？rightWell done props。W， proud to you。

 good job。yeah is that your friend too Oh yeah， shes she we don't know her we don't know her。

 but look at her boob they don't know you， they don't know you or your boobs she's hot though， right？

There's no right answer to that。 I'm just going to say yes but there's no right answer because that it's like。

 yeah， she's hot。Yeah， it yes， okay， I'll just say yes no it's like it's like the like girls like。

 do you think my friends's hot and then most guys are like， yeah， and the girls's like， okay。

Pleasure to meet sure you're wonderful up on see in Houston。

The way that I'm doing it is I'm sticking to a system religiously， it's like a religious shit for me。

Okay， so what I'm going in， do I look like I really give a fuck？Not at all。

 why don't I give a fuck though？用找。Because I'm just doing the system。

I have a system that I do it and I stick to the system religiously。I never I don't deviate。

God that I don't deviate so I know exactly what I'm gonna to do and I do it I just do it I don't think and I't want to get into the flow of the night I want to be on top of the wave of the club not under it if you're not careful you will get under the wave of the club like that like instant one of the things that blew my mind when I was first learning to approach girls was how sometimes I could have the most amazing night and that night was incredibly addictive it's what got me hooked on game。

That feeling of walking around a venue and having tons of different girls being highly responsive。

 loving you， making out you， maybe going home with a girl for me。

 it's one of the most addictive feelings on earth， especially if you believe that you could never do it。

 Now， conversely One of the other things that shocked me when I was first starting out was having a horrible night And sometimes I would have such a bad night that I would go home what in the morning or two in the morning when the clubs closing at 5 AM And I just be walking home and I could hear the music behind me and everybody laughing and having fun and I kept wondering to myself what's wrong with me。

 Why does everybody hate me tonight， what am I doing differently And because I wasn't attuned to the subtle social dynamics that were taking place。

 I wasn't aware of my behavior or how I was coming across for me it was a complete mystery as to why I was having such a shitty night Now that being the case。

 you can see why game was such a lovehate relationship for me。

 when I first got into it because sometimes I'm having the best night of my life。

 literally just such a good time I could never forget it and then。

Vly sometimes I was having some of the worst nights of my life just being rejected again and again and again。

 So there's these massive highs and lows。 And to me， that's what makes games so exciting。

 But at the same time， it's also what can make game so painful。 I'm saying dumb shit。 I'm like。

 hey what's off。 It's just dumb shit。 but I'm sticking to the system。 I don't deviate off the system。

 I have faith in the system。 Okay， most guys they're locked into self image how they look how the people are I don't give a fuck。

 I just knock down the system。 and that's it because I don't trust myself。

 to have a great night if I don't。 I know what I'll do。

 I'll wander around I'll have some go bad I over in my head。 and the night will go terrible。

 So I have a system that overwhelms the negativity。 Go that。

So whereas most guys are get in a negative loop， I have a system that overwhelms that， okay。

 all right。H。没有啊。I'm very safe and weird but safe how are you doing good how are you very good you guys go in here I'm sorry were just coming back from a different club Oh okay are you having a good time I had a very good time What are you up to I have my friends from there I'm just smoking a cigarette。

man， I think that's very sweet are you guys from？Did you know who I am Yeah。

 he's the guy that carried the baby during the like。哪里。🎼II wish I was him public speaking。

How are you doing I'm doing good I'm going to go see my friends。We're over at whatho。All right。

 have fun， have a good time oh you planneded it， you calmed it。😊，Yeah。see you guysH baby haveuse。

That's the coolest color of a jacket I've seen in all evening you two of course Thank you Yes thank you are you guys from Britain。

 how did you meet each other we what's that No really Where do you guys study management management got it That's the one thing I'm really bad at is managing。

Yeah， the second one， second one there it' me wow okay， do you have me back， you have to accept it？

Good night guys， good night。Bye。Now as time went on。

 what I learned was if you had just power through all of a sudden if you go to the end and you don't go home early。

 but yeah hammer it out until the bitter end frequently。

 not only will you get late at the very end of the night。

 there's some kind of weird karma reward system where when you just smash it out like that you get rewarded frequently but in addition to that it forces you to get to a point where you must grow it's a lot like training a muscle until failure and in some ways as I've given advice about this over the years。

 it can become a little bit of a bad pickup artist a stereotype of some guy who's sucking just burning down a whole club and I understand that so I'm giving this advice fully aware of that and you may disagree with this advice and that's fine but I can only speak from my own experience and I've never really seen a benefit in quitting and going home and I'm consistently seen huge spikes of my skills whenever I have powered through and hammered until the bitter end now what we need to understand is why this happens and this can happen at advanced level or a new level and when you're knew it can happen for。

You know， many， many times a year， and when you're in advanced it might happen a handful of times a year。

 in fact， I was actually kind of lucky that this happened to me the other night because。

It happens much less frequently。 So I was lucky to get it recorded。 Now， in my case。

 what happened was I'm a 37 year old man。 I smashed out one of the most psycho crazy seminars of my entire life。

 by the time I got out there， my hands are shaking。 I would just exhausted。

 And even when I'm walking up to a girl in my mind， I'm thinking， just go away。

 I don't want to talk to you。 And one of the most amazing things that I find is women can feel whatever you want。

 So when you walk up to a girl and you don't want to talk to her。

 you're gonna see the girls oftentime go no， no， you'll walk up and they're just like。

 they're actually feeling you but now they're saying and on a good night。

 you really do want to talk to them， you want them to say and you walk up and they're like， hi。

 because you want them to stand and talk So therefore they want you to stand talk。

 It's kind of this weird selffil prophecy that occurs。 self- fulfillfilling prophecy in general。

 that phenomenon。 They call that to pick a million effect， you can Google that is very。

 very powerful when it comes to women。 I you guys who do an approach and don't think it a010 as lose。

Bitchches that I'm going to fuck their winning and I'm going fucking annihilate them I'm going to take my fucking thing I'm going to bite their throat out。

 eat their fucking throw， I'm going to bite their like eat it， I'm going to take all their shit。😡。

I'm going to outcompete them on every fucking level。

 I'm going to destroy them because they're so arrogant to think that they can go to an approach。

 self judge it as bad。😡，And then somehow as if by magic。They could self attack。

Go into the next interaction that actually happened and it would go better。

It would go better somehow I have never gotten laid by being in a bad mood。

I have never gotten laid by being introverted in some tagging。

I have gotten laid by being delusionally， irrationally。

fident and high on myself so every criteria is meticulously reset in my brain。Fucking meticulously。

To me in my favor， to put me in upward mood so that when two o'clock a emdmialralds around。

I'm the most fun guy in that venue， usually in your game， you're always trying to get to the future。

 you're going to feel it。want something out of it， you try to make something happen。

 you're trying to get to the future when you just ease off。And you just enjoy each word。

 you just enjoy the conversation itself。 You're not trying to get anywhere。

 then all of a sudden get to the future it pushes them away。

 being like this is fun this is fun It kind of draws them in So your process is always meant to get you to the point where you take so much action andwhels the thinking mind So you want to get so much in the flow of what you're doing that the lo turns off tomorrow where Israel Why a war in Israel come my friends my friends Luke I'm very proud of you for this thing I don't really know what you mean literally going to join the army in and then are you gonna to get shot at don't get shot will try not you're too pretty。

 You're meant to breed I'm meant murder people little funny looking guys like me and him meant to kill people and then maybe get shotda then you are supposed to breed to make better looking babies I'm proud of you a hot。

 tall blonde women in New York She could。She could post on Instagram and all that kind of stuff but instead she's choosing to join the war。

 the only downside to say a cigarettes as than that I'll rate you I'll rate you as a 10 out of10 if you change your mind and want to come back and have babies we'll be here。

 I will have any baby with you that you like and he will too。And our babies would be tall。

 like we would be like it would be us going upwards。 Yes， that's right would be。

 you want to help us increase in the gene pool。 You either have a ginger You can carry us just how you carry the Israelis。

 You can carry our jeans into the next generation It would mean a lot Okay Okay。

 have fun Thank you Do you have an Instagram， I want to follow your into pictures RSD Tyler R。

TY TY LER like that's why people say to me， they're like you still like going out after all these years why that's my one time to be free。

You know， going out， that's your that's your moment to be free。

 that's your moment to get away from all this bullshit。

That's your moment to turn that off so in a weird way and what I like about women is because part of me feels mad that girls don't appreciate that logical architect guy who's making who's moving mountains。

 but then part of me says you know what， if women did like that I just be I become Mr。

 Spock I've even more tried to my head respect is a rational process。Did it ever occur to you。

 They might react emotionally。With anger， Doctor， I'm not responsible for their unpredictability。

 They were perfectly predictable。To anyone with feeling So what women give us is they reward us with sex when we have fun。

The supporter I just said do you catch out？That was good way， put it。

So rather being annoyed because part of you probably feels annoyed， like I work hard， I make money。

 I'm building something for a family yout and then you go fuck the promoter， come on。

🎼I'm building something for a family。 beautiful children。 You don't like that。 They don't。

 They so don't。 They do after the 30。 So the point being， But okay， but when they're young， you know。

 I mean， I can't be for girl， There's millions of millions of women。 I have a different opinion。

 but many don't。 And we can you can debate it， but just go go test it。

 go test it and find out yourself and see what happens。 right， Girl will even be like。

 that's not true。 I'm like， okay， come out of my boot camp， and then they're like， well。

 I guess this's room because you see it when you're when in person， when you actually go out。

 But the point is。🎼View it in a positive way。 Women want me to be free。

 Women want me to liberate myself。 They're encouraging me to take a minute to enjoy the moment。

 Got it。 So women are like， dude， just enjoy the moment， relax。

 You don't need to make a million dollars。 You don't need to like fight the man。 On， You know't。

 right， Like， you don't need to be in your like crusade against the bad guys。 Like just dance。

You know， that's what they're telling you like just dance someone， just dance to me， chokeking me。

 be free， be it be a crazy dickhead， have fun， you know。

 they're telling me to do that so everything I do is a system designed to put me into that mode and then I just have a little fun。

Pull home have sex， go back to work and then do it again。

 and you just do it and get it and get it again。 Now we could look at this as overthinking it。

 but cold approach is hard。 Most guys get blown out mercilessly when they go out。Mercilessly。

 so you have to have ways around it now ironically the cold approach。

 what is hard is the hardest thing in the world， but conversely what's the converse opposite of that？

When cold approach is easy， it's the easiest thing in the world right have you guys ever had that before it just became weirdly easy？

No it is like you'll see it， you'll see it so you've got to like really keep it like even if you're crushing it。

 you made all like 10 girls still if one rejects you， you got to be like 10 out of 10。

What do you and then you go to the next one。 What's up do you mean by that Because you're doing awesome And then now like so many in a row go amazing And then all of a sudden you're like one goes bad and then you fall out of it or you want to protect it。

 You're like， I'm in a good mood now。 I don't even want to go it anymore because I'm finally feeling self fulfilled Yeah。

 so you try to avoid going in， don't do that， That's when you press the gas down。

 Like when you're there， you're like I'll wreck it all， Who cares， Put the gas down。

 Let's go and then you get even more lessons whenever you ride that edge and stretch that edge out。

 That's when you get more lessons， you get better Can you come back because we have to ask you a question。

 Are you doing anything productive with your life。Am I what do you do I just graduated college and we can happen and what did you graduate in？

graduate with a major in communications and a minor in human Development and what are you going to do next？

And I'm gonna work this summer and finish up the classes that I have to finish and then what are you going do with that are you going to become a child helper I'm going to become a teacher a teacher of kids that's amazing Are you gay Yes yes no one will see are you gay for yourself for gay for real but good real kids。

Yeah。But don't ask us to make out。 that's so rude。 People No we're not。 we don't put on a show。

 We don't put on a show No no what are you Latina are you Latina kind Latin Greek and are you kidding she likes she wants us to do a gay or you'll notice that I talked a lot about self fulfillfiling prohe earlier and then I also talked about ego and breaking the ego Now what I'm getting at here is that a rough night is your best opportunity to create what I'd like to call energetic control Now what I want you to do is I want you to get your head out of this concept of meeting women is this kind of thing that you do because you don't have a girl in your life and you're gonna go get a girl or you're not getting laid and you're gonna go get laid and I want you to imagine that it's this whole other thing and if you understand it as this of thing you're gonna get laid way more than you normally would and you're gonna have an incredible girlfriend or girlfriends in your life but you've got to kind get out of that paradigm of the basics to really go to an elite level with it。

 That's if you want to although funny enough when you go to this level with it。

Wind up taking care of the kind of simpler needs now。

 the way that I envision tonight night out is that。Getting girls。

 that's guaranteed you're gonna to do that you're taking massive action。

 you're approaching tons of people， you're gonna crush it with girls， that's an obvious thing。

 but what's not obvious is the deeper levels that you're gonna to get out of your experience doing it right because you're gonna to put in this amount of time and is really all that you want to get out of this is just to get laid at that point you could order a prostitute or you could go to a third country or you know just go on on Tider or something like that which could be cool too but what I want to get out of it is not just to get laid I want to be getting way more than that so the way that I look at success with women and what kept me in it for all these years because otherwise I would have quit years ago。

 I have no reason saying it because I've already got great girls to my life is that I'm learning energetic control。

And women are the best teachers of energetic control so like I said earlier。

 women are the best self-filproy if you think I really want to talk to this girl。

 they typically not always but typically they want to talk to you and if you think I don't really want to talk to this girl they usually don't if you think my ego needs attention because my ego needs me to feel good you know what women do check this out if a woman feels that your ego is craving validation she says sweetie I'm going to help you get even more validation。

 I'm not enough validation for you， I'm going smash you down。

And force you to get centered within yourself。This is women's greatest gift。

 women's greatest gift is that they leave us， reject us and dump us when we're not centerensed。

 they do it。It pretty quickly， so fast。You know， if you're in a longer term relationship。

 you get a little bit of a window， but for the most part， you're going to find that。You know。

 it happens pretty quickly， you'll see it， you lose your center。

 you're out so what you're seeing is that when you go out。

 you're doing it for the purpose of getting energetic control。

 you're actually learning how to control your energy where you're out。

Now let's have a look at where you fall off of this， okay， this is the key。

When you go out the mistakes that you'll make one of them is that you're not controlling self- fulfillfilling prophecies you don't really want to talk to her you think that you do but you don't you're saying that you want to go talk to her but you're lying really what you want is just to kind of get through it right so they say hey。

 you're just trying to get through it to get your approaches bang you're out or what happens is that you say I just want validation I need validation they go hey you want validation you're not gonna to get that for me you you got to get back on your journey to figuring out how to be centered in your own self bang you're out so what happens is with meeting women it's all about just being in an amus state and knowing what you want right so it's essentially co-creation in action because what's happening is stay centerturn。

 you're in a fun state you're self amused you're having a great time。😡。

You're at the cause not the effect， you are creating reality around you。

 but what starts to happen like taking me when I went out tired。Okay， so on one level。

 we could say it's very reasonable that when I'm coming off a huge seminar and I'm giving everything I have。

 I can't go crush it with girls。And yet， is that reasonable？Yeah， it's an average person it is。

 I understand that very reasonable in regular personal land， but what about what we're teaching here。

 even when tired， even when spent， is that an excuse to want to just get through something。

 is that an excuse to say， hey， you know what I'm just trying to create an outcome no。

 you gotta enjoy every moment， if I'm going out there and I'm tired I'm just like pushing my way through it I'm like like that I'm not having gratitude。

 even for a moment what I'm exhausteding。So you've got to have gratitude even for moments when you're exhausted。

 you've got to have gratitude， even for moments when your state is down。

 when you're doubting yourself you've got to have gratitude for all of it and if you do and you push through it。

Bm， you're back on track okay， you know a lot of bas I put here because that's a lot what it's like when you're out there on a rough night okay。

 when you're on a rough night， it's like it's just gets denser and more painful and harder and harder and harder and the next thing you know something shifts and let me tell you something when it does that is one of the best feelings in the entire world we're not just the lighter with theme for people。

W magic I apologize you're so beautiful， you're going to destroy your looks of this berinkly that we're so beautiful honestly it's very social I don't even know a pack a cigarettes。

Canada。ya。Where in Canada are you from I grew up in Ottawa。

 Canada and then I went to school in Cason and then I moved to LA an engagement。Right that's。

OhAnd I'm  wow， okay， cool， Oh my God， you her boyfriend， I am her boyfriend。Sokes on you suckers。

 hi baby there boom， okay。好了嗯该见名。What I do is I just focus on my execution of the process。

 and then I just execute it。 That's all I think about。 Why do you think that is。

Game has too many swings。So if youre if you're focusing on on results。

 you drive yourself crazy rather。A rough night is an opportunity。

To examine what you do differently when you're tired or rough mood or whatever else。

 then and then you go home and you can think it over。 Don't think about it too much in the field。

 It's in actually typically after rougher nights， it really allows you to examine。

What you would have done differently and then to tweak your process to give you the best opportunity to win。

 So it's all part and parcel of it。 Okay， remember the method。Is。

Who the fuck would have the ball to do that and find something funny about it。

 And you'll always forget， I know because I'll tell you guys at the start of the program。 I'm like。

 remember when I ask you what you rated It' 10 out of 10。 And then guyssh you're like， yeah。

 remember， then I'm like， I promise you you won't and you won't。 And then。😡。

All of a sudden you start to go shitty when you hit a little rough rough swing。

 you don't want to allow that to happen， you're too much in reaction like decide from a product to state what you do want to do and what works the best for you and then actually do it。

For me I find if I just do all of them it's easier or most of them at least， but other guys。

 maybe that's a little too much， maybe maybe just do only specific ones。

 but you got to stick to it as the key， okay you？He。You guys are a cute couple， I would just say。

W him。Why here。Why not me？Why him， got what did he have that I don't？🎼大女儿。Fine。Fine。

 you guys are a very cute couple， by the way， really on。So marriage ist。

I'm proud of guys you guys are going to be so happy。だ。Get there， in there。I love you。I love you。🎼来比。

来。do to me the go go with him and destroy my life are you feeling him for me？Is it because？

You like his beard， why are you doing this？Take， take them。🎼Do it， take。や。🎼爱这们。Leaving now。🎼は。

I love you。One that kiss。Take my Instagram quick。Okay。

 so we've covered how a bad night actually gets you to think a lot about your interships that you need to make and I really believe that game。

 so to speak， is one of your best opportunities to。

Weirdly kind of manifest whatever is going on in here and make that show up out here so to me that's really amazing。

 but I also believe that there is an outer methodology and in my case。

 I actually have a system that I go about every single night and one of my major philosophies and success with women is don't sit there getting caught up at any one interaction rather focused on perfecting this system。

Okay now for most people that system would be something like you know say the perfect thing or you know you say the same thing every time and that's cool like if that's your thing。

 I'm all about that but for me I tend to go very free sociative so the system for me is rather the rhythm and pacing that I'm gonna run my night so I have a clear understanding of how my ice is gonna start and the pacing of which I'm gonna to be approaching I have a clear understanding of how my knifes going end and all the rhythm in between and so what most guys do really try to follow me here is most guys go into an interaction and if it goes well。

 they're like yeahy and if it goes bad they're like and they're really the mercy of the girl they're really giving away their power and the women feel that。

Now what I do is I say to myself， what's a typical night， so you know let's look at my typical night。

I decide to go out， maybe I do a couple short approaches on my way to the venue then I get in the venue and I might cross the venue just talking to a couple people in just a cool chill way。

 then as those interactions go either bad or good doesn't matter to me then I start doing longer ones then I start merging different groups of people together and creating an awesome party and by the end of it。

 I'm so much in the flow of what I'm doing that I become funer and just clear in what I'm doing and more free of outcome and basically I take so much action it shuts off the thinking mind So I love that about my nights out And for me what I do is I don't worry。

 oh did this one person like me， how did this go， how did that go。

 I just stick to the rhythm of my night， and if I stick on it and I stick to that system I know that I'm in the best opportunity to do really really well So when I gauge myself say that on a rate my night out of 10 I don't say oh this one approach was a six out of 10 or a7 out of 10 every approach is  a0 out of 10 But what I do rate is how well I handle the。

Pacing of my night。 And if I handled the rhythm and the pacing of my night and I did it well。

 then I'm happy with myself。 Now， what if I did it perfectly And it still didn't work out so much at that point。

 what I do is I go home and I make adjustments， I say。Maybe there's something changing inside me。

 maybe there's an interchange in me Maybe I'm gonna shift it to where I kind of chill with my buddies and relax and then just do the odd approach Maybe I'm gonna chill more and just wait for the exact row that I want and do only one or two approaches sometimes you'll have these weird inter shifts where that starts to work better Other times I'll you know what I'm not doing enough interaction and then at that point I know that I need to tweak it to do more and more so going out see here's what I love about it。

Your mind is going to not want to go with that system。

 your mind is going to try to dodge and weave around taking any action and the reason's very simple。

 it's a workout for your prefrontal cortex。😡，Prefrontal cordex that's the willpower part of your brain。

 And so when you're out， you're kind of just wanting to be like like you'll see it。

 you'll walk by girls and you're like。And you'll just keep making every excuse in the book not to go up。

 And you have what's called action taking momentum and excuse making momentum。

 So sometimes you make one excuse then you make another excuse， another excuse， another excuse。

 another excuse， Then finally， you feel like shit， And then what happens， you finally go up。

 It doesn't go well， and then you feel even more like shit and your night bombs out Conversely。

 you have actionta momentum or maybe you get into a flow。

 or maybe you just start to feel very congruent to what you're doing， I mean。

 this can actually be a major major factor right Like so much in this is evaluating yourself。

 was I congruent， Did I burn myself out。 Was I putting on a persona。 Was I jud you myself too much。

 Was I not rating every single interaction is 10 out of 1， Was I not finding things funny about it。

 You'll see this with guys all the time， they go out。

 And they forget what I've said in so many videos， you got to rate every single interaction is 100 out of 10。

😡，You got to find something funny about it and you got to say who the fuck have the ball to do that So what if you forget that What if you forget to keep that format and you're like that one just wasn't that good What starts to happen Typically what I've seen is that your night goes boom。

 boom boom so you didn't follow your system。😡，You see that。

 so there's this different things that you're supposed to do。

And you'll notice that like don't worry about my system， okay， I can show you how to do it。

 look a video， I've called the six steps。It's all great stuff。

 but even I change my system and even I will use my system up until the point where I don't need it。

 and then I kind of shift off of it。 So the particular system。😡，You know I can show you what I do。

 I can show you kind starter ones that I teach other people。

 but really it's about you meticulously understanding how your night's going play out and putting yourself in a position to win。

 And so what a bad night does is it tests that system it's going to test it and it's gonna to test your resolve to stick with the system or to make tweaks in the system It's going to test your result are you being congruent or are you being incongruent Are you being a little bitch are you having the balls Are are you kind pushing too much energy What's going on with you and on a bad night is going to test that and it's gonna give you amazing feedback So that being the case you're noticing a pattern here。

 which is that the bad night is testing both your inner resolve saying present and enjoying the moment being in gratitude feeling good and making that great reality that you have inside yourself begin to manifest externally but in addition that it' also testing your outer systems and it' putting pressure on it It's just like the NBA finals know two different teams。

 one from the ease， one from the west they work all year to perfect both their inner cycle。😡。

But also their systems， how they play the game And then the increased pressure it either bust a pipe or that pressure creates diamonds。

 So that being the case when you go out， understand part of it is a test of your inner game。

 part of it is also a test of the strength in your mind。

 How much willpower do you have But part of it is also increased pressure on those systems and it gives you an opportunity either A to go home and make adjustments or B to press through and see what happens and find out if you come out at the end of the night。

 victorious Are you Are you the guardian of him。To get to him， do I have to go through you？

Maybe why he's asking I just see。I want to hug for you I'ming him by the way mayben to meet you That's a very happy look out theres You just just came。

Eln， I want to be a woman in my next life， I can be to happy。

I think men we just never look quite as letful as that like on my best day I like that really I can win like a million dollars and maybe I wouldn't be like。

I gotcha， are you naturally very happy or are you just on Molly？Here。I'm very， very proud of you。

Very proud of you guys， okay， do you have Instagram？I'll DMmU。With thunder scores。Yeah。

It's so hard dude I'll see you in here Yeah， nice to meet you part you too。Oh man， hey， what's up？

Are you my new girlfriend。 He's not Mar straight。 I will be your new girlfriend。

 kiss cheek on the beard kiss。 That was beautiful。 I May my dreams come true。Yeah。

 are you from Israel？I'm going to Israel two days， I could have guess that really。I'm Israeli。

 I know what？I will text LA， hit me up on Instagram I run a selfhel Instagram So it has like these weird videos on about selfhel。

 have we do now we do now， Yeah， okay， on sweet my god my guys have fun I'm obsessed with all of you。

 have fun， see， it seems like a lot of rejections， but how long did it really take five minutes It seems like this like dissent into hell。

 right， but it's really just me just mixing it up for five minutes。

 And then the first one goes your way， and then we build from there。😡。

fuckingm just okay so but you see my point right but and you just wait for the first one to go your way and it will。

 And then yeah I just get in there of course of course the girl want to take away your after Yeah they're like I'm obsessed with you better looking guys and then you just build your night out from there and it just goes better and better and better and better and better。

 All right， so thank you so much for going on this journey with me through New York City we're gonna wrap here in the Brooklyn Bridge and what I want to do is itparts you my subjective beliefs。

 And when I say subjective beliefs what I'm saying is that I have no proof of any of what I'm saying but rather is just showing you kind of the weird human beliefs that I have and what I want you to do is not just take what I'm saying and face value because you never should but rather。

Use it as a case study and then ask yourself how these subjective beliefs help me to win okay so look at these beliefs that I'm gonna share with you。

 you don't need to adopt them， but rather just look at how it helps me and then create your own version okay now to lead into this I'm gonna say to you that just because I've told you to hammer it out to the bitter end just as I told you to keep going even on a rough night that doesn't mean to get。

A problem out of it， okay in other words， you know you got to bounce for staring at you or you don't have a big group of people are like not okay with it。

 then you don't need to do that okay， you don't need to make a problem for yourself you got to use your common sense here okay。

I got to implore you you got to use common sense here but what you saw in the video here was one of my bad nights leading into some fun at the end and what you'll see is that I went about it in such a way that was all cool right I got to go through my process my journey without making any big problems was great you got to do the same thing and here's the underlying mindset that I take behind it like I said my subjective beliefs okay。

😡，For me， I don't believe that we're put here on this earth for everything to go perfect。

I don't believe that at all。 In fact， I believe that when things go well， that's great。

 but that's kind of just the default when you're doing what you're supposed to do。

 look you do all the right shit， it's gonna go awesome that's obvious okay you take the right actions。

 right results will come。 So that's great， you know， you got a nice meal。

 maybe you have sex to grow you're attracted to maybe you make some money。

 maybe you go on a nice vacation。It's all great stuff。

You know why I think you're really born on this earth？It's not just a now okay。

 it's not just that I think there's something much deeper going on。

 I think that you chose your pain before you came here just my subject beliefs， I think you chose it。

 I think that on a bad night you're being tested。And on that bad night。

 you've got to look at it and instead of just being in pain。

 you've got to find that little last seatd of consciousness that's left in there okay because you're not one dudeer right you're kind of falling into unconsciousness。

 you're like gosh， shit。This look， it's like， I hate this and you're being hammered with low vibration energy。

And when you're watching this video at home， maybe you're not in a low vibration say right now。

 maybe you're in a high vibration state。And when you're feeling good。

 it's hard to remember what it's like to be in that low vibration state。

 but there's very few things in life that will trigger low vibration energy than not getting approval and particularly not getting approval from a big group of people so when person after person after person it's not giving you approval and you're really trying your best like you're really given everything you have and it's not panning out and's like it opens the floodgates of pain and low vibration energy and self-attack and selfcriticism and in that moment you have two choices of my experience and I've been through thousands of these okay I want to put in context that when I speak passionately about this it's not like this is the shit that happened like this one time this happened to me thousands of times what I learned was I can go home in shame and self-criticism and just trying to get out of pain Ill wake up I'll feel okay the next day it's good enough I guess it's better than nothing or I can say you know what fuck this fuck this okay and youll look the low vibration。

😡，Egy right in the fucking eye， you look the devil right in the eye the power of Christ compels you does it the power of Christ compels you that'ss of Christ compels you and you say fuck you。

 I'm in control here We're going okay， we're doing this I have faith this happened for a reason I'm fucking doing it I'm going for it and that's that And in your lowest moment of consciousness。

When you feel like you can't do it， you can't do it， man， it's too ho。

You push yourself through the night。And when you do it， save yourself， this is what I say to myself。

 I say the glory is here now， the glory is mine， this is my time。

 this is the time to be tested and I love it。People look at me， they're like，" damnamn， dude。

 you're having a rough night。I'm like what are you talking about a rough night this is an amazing night This is the night Okay。

 this is the night that you've been waiting for the night where the growth will be achieved the night where you're really gonna to see what your systems are made of。

 what your inner game is made of how aligneds you are how much you can move into that moment while at the same time being free of outcome。

 keeping your joy， keeping your gras while you're getting hammered okay anybody can just sit there looking great when things are going well。

 anybody can do that， Any in the world can sit there and you know just go what great when things are going well right？

But whatever I've had my most difficult experience， and in that moment， you can say。Oh fuck this。

 I wish I was fucking dead or you could say you know what， this is the time。

 this is the moment and when I've realized that oftentimes you're being tested。

This is my subjective experience， you're being tested as you move into high vibration energy。

 as you move into presence， you get a little test that says， you want this， do you have faith？

And fundamentally， that low vibration of energy， where is it coming from。

 it's coming from resistance， it's coming from you wishing that things were different than they are。

So this moment， this moment of glory， this beautiful， beautiful moment， this right in front of you。

 it's so beautiful， what it's saying to you do you have faith？Can you accept what's happening。

 can you not be in resistance to it？Can you just accept it， this is what it is。Can you move anyway？

Can you push through it？Sometimes it's got to be hard。

Sometimes you're called upon to do something difficult and it's harder than you ever expected that it would be。

And。You can cower from that。But in my opinion， what's going to happen is you're going to keep going through that again and again and again until you get it。

Of course， a lot of it is the physical technique that you're executing。

 getting better doing under pressure， becoming clutch， rewiring the minds。

To perform under that kind of pressure is amazing， one of the best feelings in the fucking world as you get older。

 you've done it for years and years， you look at others that can't do it， you go wow。

 so grateful that I went through that， but going deeper it's a test of faith。It's asking。

Did I ask for this， I'm being flooded with negativity right now， I'm being flooded over。

 I got this cloud。I have a low vibration energy on me right now， right？

And am I going to walk through the shadow， the valley of death and come out the other side。

 or am I going to sit there and be a fucking cry baby and go home？

So that's why sometimes people look at me， like I remember one time I I was 2009。

 my buddy Connell was out with me and he was saw me having a rough night。

 and I'm working through it I'm like dude， I'm working through this shit。 He's like。

 do you love this。He's like， you seem like you love it。I said， of course I do。

 this is where the growth comes from I'm barely even conscious to that point because I think so many girls rejected me in a row I'm in this weird。

 low vibration energy cloud。Life is fucking sucking in that moment。It sucks， I understand， right。

 we go through it。I say yes， I love this shit， I'm going to work through it because when I fucking come through the other side of this it's going to feel so fucking good。

 the reward is going to be so great right it's like going through a desert getting a big glass of water at the end it's going to be fucking amazing。

That night I pushed through and you watched me win by the end and I've done that on countless nights so that's my great joint game just getting laid of the nether girls cool。

 it's fun that'll never saw being funny anybody that's not fun， they don't appreciate life。

 but there's a whole other layer of gratitude for those rough nights and pushing through them。

And not just blindly pushing through them， just like making people right away from you。

 wear them out， but looking at yourself， right okay， how am I acting， looking at it？

My in resistanceist am I being too heavy， can I let it go， can I shake it off？

And one of the great skills that human beings that we lack， typically。

 is the ability to throw off low vibration energy。And that's why to me。

 this is like a divine skill set， the ability to be steeped in low vibration energy to be tested and say no。

I have faith。I'm not going to resist this。I'm going to walk through this。

I'm going to learn from this thank you， thank you for giving me this opportunity， thank you so much。

 thank you。Powering through it。Just opening up， saying。Let's go。

Best feeling in the world so I made this video， you know I'm a niche takeup dude that's me right I love it。

 that's my thing， maybe you've got your own thing maybe this relates to what you do。

 maybe you do exactly what I do I don't know， but I made this to show you my experience of it something that back when I was 22 it could barely even get a conversation going having these horrible nights。

Oftentimes for months at a time， I mean when you get in a downward spiral it can last a while if you don' know how to get out now know how to get out and I can use those skills in regular life。

 which is so fun， it's so rewarding to know how to do that to reflect on all the work that you put in to get in that point。

 but you know just knowing this and sharing it it's a reflection of what I've been through and it's how I think about it it's a clear reflection of how I think about it I'm not asking for you to think the same way but I hope that if nothing else you at least saw one man's process one man's perspective on how you rather than cowering away when things get heavy。

 you could look at it an entirely different way you could look at it as a gift as the most special night as the moment of glory to have faith。

 reaffirm your faith and push through to your ultimate goal anyway。

 this is actually my last way Im shooting in New York。

 I hope you enjoyed it it's pleasure to shoot it amazing to be out here and thank you for coming on the journey with me。

 I appreciate it very， very much So good nights Godspeed at all talk to you soon。

🎼Oh the the the the the。
