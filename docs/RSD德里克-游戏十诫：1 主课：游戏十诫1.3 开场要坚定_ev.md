Admin speed„ÄÇTal shallal Comppin let you mean it„ÄÇWhat will happen if this commandment is disobeyedÔºü

Women and men in those interactions will treat you as though you have the spine of a jellyfish„ÄÇ

You'll disappoint yourself and countless women who would have been excited to have sex with you if you took the initiative to open directly„ÄÇ

 with certainty and with enthusiasm„ÄÇThe commandment explained„ÄÇ

Womemen don't spend hours planning their outfitsÔºå doing their makeup„ÄÇ

Because it'd hate to meet an awesome man„ÄÇOftentimes the girl is on her sideÔºå but you're not„ÄÇ

She wants to meet a chair„ÄÇShe wants to meet a man who was exciting and compelling to her„ÄÇ

Furman his own identity„ÄÇHe has cool friends„ÄÇDudes with good shit going on„ÄÇ

 don't just respect you by hitting on her„ÄÇHas social skills and resourcefulness to dominate her peer group in a respectful but exciting way„ÄÇ

Someone it was captivating to chat with„ÄÇEasy to follow his lead„ÄÇ

Someone who she knows will lead her to better ways and brighter days„ÄÇ

If you behave like a champ and have physicalÔºå social„ÄÇ

 and intellectual compatibility and good overlapping your values and goals„ÄÇ

Shouldll follow you anywhere„ÄÇContraarily„ÄÇIf you want' like something is wrong with you„ÄÇ

 don't be surprised when she thinks something is wrong with you„ÄÇIf you don't think you deserve her„ÄÇ

 she has to agree she's in the club to have a fun timeÔºå man„ÄÇ

She isn't going to give a stranger the courtesy of entertaining him if he's not going to help her accomplish that goal„ÄÇ

When a man acts timid„ÄÇUnsure or insecureÔºå shyÔºå artificial„ÄÇEraaticÔºå incongruentÔºå etc cetera„ÄÇ

She just wants you to be far away from herÔºå she probably doesn't have a PhD in psychology„ÄÇ

And even if she doesÔºå she'll not be inclined to psychoanalyze someone exhibiting these seemingly pathetic behaviors„ÄÇ

Experience this taught or she's best to just give rid of or get away from you and simply wait for a more attractive man to come along„ÄÇ

When you approach with hesitationÔºå then just stare or lurk around on the periphery like a creep„ÄÇ

 she wishes you and your genetic code didn't exist„ÄÇI call this H Choium„ÄÇ

Every time you hover or showed a girlÔºå a player down in hell sheds a tear„ÄÇ

This is the textbook behavior of a true sexual predator„ÄÇPeople who do this are at best„ÄÇ

Just procrastinating until the situation changes to be even less favorable than rationalizing they should just talk to a different girl instead„ÄÇ

It's not a strategy that's going to lead to the most premier outcomes available to you„ÄÇ

This is the strategy that's going to lead you home alone to look at family photos and masturbate with whip cream like the fucking creep you are„ÄÇ

Stop this shitÔºå stop it immediately„ÄÇThe reward for extreme hesitancy in the hoverer choing will be no sex until you extinguish this disgusting behavior„ÄÇ

Men who do this habitually are more likely to have sex with an animal or a blow up child than a human woman„ÄÇ

HisBe is universally re to women„ÄÇPagmatic application of this commandment„ÄÇ

When you see a girl you're excited aboutÔºå take the most direct path from where you are to where she is„ÄÇ

The quickest possible path from A to B„ÄÇMove with intent and purpose along the way„ÄÇ

Move others out of your way if need be„ÄÇHerere in a nightclub„ÄÇ

 others will be touching and bumping into you as well throughout the night„ÄÇ

No need to run into them like an attackerÔºå just move them out of your way now„ÄÇ

Excuse me if you feel like it„ÄÇComing with enthusiasm„ÄÇ

How excited can she possibly be to meet a guy who isn't excited to meet herÔºü

You have to speak to every woman at a new openÔºå so she might be the most amazing girl you'll meet this month„ÄÇ

Note„ÄÇThis does not mean that you should treat her like a princess or put her on a pedestal„ÄÇ

 it simply means treat her like a human that you're sincerely curious about and excited to know more about„ÄÇ

I'm often told by a clientÔºå but DerekÔºå I feel like I'm minute uping her conversation with someone else„ÄÇ

WellÔºå yesÔºå you are„ÄÇWe are judging her perception of this incorrectly in most cases„ÄÇ

No one wants their life to be interrupted for a negative reasonÔºå but by a mugger or a beggar„ÄÇ

But what could be more compelling than interrupting her life for the betterÔºüLet me ask you„ÄÇ

IfSomeone interrupted our communication right now and handed you a check for $100Ôºå000„ÄÇ

 would you be okay with thatÔºüAfter the initial shock wore off„ÄÇ

 I wouldn't give it to him if OJ Simpson interrupted my shower while I was washing my balls„ÄÇ

 so long as he was handing out $100Ôºå000 checks that day„ÄÇ

Interrupting people in the course of offering even more goodness to their lives is always a pleasant surprise„ÄÇ

Interruping to steal their fun is of courseÔºå disgusting to all„ÄÇ

Initiate physicality early in the interaction like soon after the alÔºå even on the al„ÄÇ

It needs to feel normal to her that you are touching her and that everything is okay guys that have 10 and 20 minute conversations with the girl without moving her or creating physical contact„ÄÇ

Or selling their own demise„ÄÇNews flashlash if she isn't cool with you touching her upper arm or her shoulder„ÄÇ

 Chipa isn't going to have sex with you tonight„ÄÇGather this information in the first couple minutes„ÄÇ

 not half an hour later„ÄÇMore on this topic and subsequent commandments„ÄÇ

Speak to volume level that commands her attention„ÄÇWhen you are too quiet or too soft„ÄÇ

 don't be surprised when she ignores you and keeps doinging whatever she was doing„ÄÇ

She didn't blow you outÔºå you rejected yourself when you chose to act like a little boy instead of a man„ÄÇ

You have no idea how many guys see pissed on their growing feet by simply not projecting their voice properly„ÄÇ

You don't have to be crazy with this„ÄÇItP 10 or 15% above the prevailvalian energy or intensity of whatever environment you're in„ÄÇ

The same principle holds true in a library„ÄÇStarbucks on public transportation in the nightclub„ÄÇ

 just 10Ôºå15% above the prevailing energy or intensity man„ÄÇIf you're too quiet„ÄÇ

 you'll just be ignored„ÄÇIf you're too loud and it's uncalibrated„ÄÇ

 this can come off very unsettling or even terrifying„ÄÇIn nearly every circumstance„ÄÇ

 I suggest opening to her directly„ÄÇLet her know from the beginning of your intention that you find her attractive and are intimately interested in her„ÄÇ

This canÔºå but doesn't need to be stated overtly„ÄÇ You can easily convey this information by simply standing close to her„ÄÇ

A good rule of thumb about this is to stand with your shouldersÔºå roughly parallel with hers„ÄÇ

And at a distanceÔºå such that„ÄÇIf your elbows were pin at your sides„ÄÇ

 you could touch her with your fingertipsÔºå this distance helps adjust for your height„ÄÇ

If you're an abnormally tall or muscular man„ÄÇMoop another 20% further away at first„ÄÇ

So you're still intermittent and masculine without being overbearing„ÄÇBy at first„ÄÇ

 I just mean a few secondsÔºå maybe half a minute„ÄÇIf you're a smaller man„ÄÇ

 get closer and be more physical to convey a greater masculine presence„ÄÇNote„ÄÇ

 some men argue against opening two directly„ÄÇI think this makes a lot of sense in some small social circle situations„ÄÇ

We're in a corporate work environment„ÄÇIn most other contexts„ÄÇ

 it just means that this guy is a pussy who doesn't value his life and doesn't mind wasting his time having countless nice chats with women that lead to nowhere„ÄÇ

Jus thinks you're her new gay friend„ÄÇWake upÔºå good„ÄÇ

You will likely be doing most of the talking in the first couple minutes of an interaction„ÄÇ

The words don't matter so muchÔºå they're mostly a vehicle that provides you the context to convey„ÄÇ

RelaxÔºå get intimate body language„ÄÇIt'sTable at non anxious foronality„ÄÇAnd most importantly„ÄÇ

 our identity and personality„ÄÇCovered in more detail in Commandments two and five„ÄÇ

Pa reputable Te suggests the words themselves are only 7 to 10% of the communication„ÄÇ

The other 90% plus is nonverbal„ÄÇThis should be a delight to those of you who habitually run out of things to say„ÄÇ

She wants to be your certainty in your voice and see it in your mannerisms„ÄÇ

Youar more on how to convey rock solid certainty to a woman on my the 10 Commandments of game interview with Tyler„ÄÇ

Focus on primarily talking to your target girl„ÄÇIn addressing the others in the group secondaryarily„ÄÇ

 guys often blunder badly here when they think they're doing themselves a favor opening the entire group„ÄÇ

And then be brandy in them all„ÄÇInstead's of picking one girl and indicating that you think she's special„ÄÇ

This is not flattering to your target girl„ÄÇChaopter thinks that you were either the type of guy who a„ÄÇ

That's the confidence you just go for what you want„ÄÇ

Or B would have hooked up with any of her other female friends who made eye contact and showed interest in you„ÄÇ

Either way„ÄÇEven if she would have liked you had you approached her properly„ÄÇYou won't want you now„ÄÇ

Does she know as any of her friends could have had you too and that they also know itÔºü

You're no longer a prizeÔºå even if you would have been her type of guyÔºå she has to pick somebody else„ÄÇ

Guys are doing this to themselves„ÄÇI the mixed Gu Girl sets too half of the time these guys are just coworker or gay friends or some orbiter ch„ÄÇ

Cl has no interest in these guys sexually„ÄÇThis is also a way to differentiate yourself from the average club chde because the girls know it takes balls and tolerance to social pressure to approach a girl surrounded by guys„ÄÇ

Any women need the man to talk more at first to get a sense of who he is and see if she cares„ÄÇ

Remember„ÄÇüéºAttracted women have a lot of guys hitting on them„ÄÇ She doesn't immediately love you„ÄÇ

 That's normal„ÄÇFor default assumption of you is's probably that you're about the 50th percentile of man„ÄÇ

It's very rational„ÄÇIt means you're about the average of the last thousand dudes that just came to gruel on her„ÄÇ

Let's put a little math on that„ÄÇHow many of these last thousand guys do you think the girl had sex withÔºü

I think it's less than 3%Ôºå I think they'd be a lot„ÄÇThere's no academic study on it„ÄÇ

 but my intuition is„ÄÇSomething like five to 20„ÄÇI'm going to think 10 or so„ÄÇSome girls would be three„ÄÇ

 some girls would be noneÔºå I don't want them either„ÄÇFraezy math„ÄÇ

 I'm going to presume that's about 1% of men call it 2% if you preferÔºå I don't think it's 3„ÄÇ

1% of men out of the thousand that she hooked up withÔºå it's only 10 dudes„ÄÇ10 out of1 thousand„ÄÇOne%„ÄÇ

Think on this„ÄÇIf you approach a womanÔºå like a 50th percentile dudeÔºå just I'm average smuck„ÄÇ

 just I'm nobody„ÄÇWhat's the she's going to hook up with youÔºüIt's that going to happenÔºå manÔºü

There's a couple factors at play here„ÄÇThis means you've got to be in the98thÔºå 99th percentile of men„ÄÇ

For girl to hook up with you„ÄÇPro got to be in the top 5% you have real serious considerations„ÄÇ

It're not going to be in everybody's 98 percentile„ÄÇbestest way to overcome the situation„ÄÇ

It just simply screen and open more girls„ÄÇHe's going to be his upset of girls„ÄÇ

 fierce productive and self motivated guyÔºå who knows who he isÔºå knows what he wants„ÄÇ

 knows the type of people he wants to be around„ÄÇYou're already going to be in the top five or 10% of men yourself„ÄÇ

Because those couple principles put you in the top5%„ÄÇHowever„ÄÇ

 not every girl' is going to prefer a man like you„ÄÇ

 just like you're not going to prefer just every girl„ÄÇ

 You're going to have to do a little screening here„ÄÇ You're going to have to sort through the muck„ÄÇ

üéºFind those girls are recognized that you're the top 5% of men„ÄÇ Sc through that„ÄÇ

 Find out about personality FimentÔºå Find out about your compatibility in terms of sense of humor„ÄÇ

 your goalsÔºå your ambitions„ÄÇ What are your hopes and dreams„ÄÇ

 What do you want your relationship to look likeÔºå More on this in subsequent commandments„ÄÇ

But the point isÔºå don't expect every girl to like youÔºå just like you wouldn't like every girl„ÄÇ

 and on the openÔºå you got to open every girl like you expect you're the guy in that 98th„ÄÇ

 99th percentile„ÄÇYou to open her from the frame that you are a sexworth man„ÄÇ

 and you and her may or may not be compatibleÔºå but you're going to find that out quickly if a couple minutes go by and things aren't going down the path you'd like him to„ÄÇ

 you can't go find a different womanÔºå you'll find a better option„ÄÇ

 and be better off and you't have a great life either way„ÄÇPick up story for my life„ÄÇ

Once upon a time I was in WashingtonÔºå DCÔºå where barely a beautiful woman exists„ÄÇ

I was at a bar with a good wing down of mineÔºå one of the best I have had„ÄÇ

I saw the prettiest curl that we had seen all week„ÄÇ

 she was leaning on the bar with a semicircle of very muscular men surrounding her„ÄÇ

They were a rugby team it about 10 or 12 of them on the approach it moves several of these men out of my way„ÄÇ

 a couple to one sideÔºå a couple to the otherÔºå and make a path between them„ÄÇ

 physically shove larger men and walks straight to the girl and meet her„ÄÇ

I got right in her face a few inches away„ÄÇüéºIts very calm„ÄÇI could eye contactÔºå I wasn't jerky„ÄÇ

 I wasn't hesitantÔºå shit was on point„ÄÇI looked her right in her eyes„ÄÇIPut my hand out and I said„ÄÇ

 I'merk„ÄÇA really pretty girl I had to come meet youÔºå she smiled from year to yearÔºå she blushed„ÄÇ

 she was so excitedÔºå her face just lit up to meet me„ÄÇ

Versus all these guys who were scanning around oriented to death„ÄÇI took her by the hand„ÄÇ

 I turned aroundÔºå moved right through the crowd againÔºå moving them out of my way„ÄÇ

And pulled her over by herself with just the two of usÔºå which added for just a few minutes„ÄÇ

Today then my buttdy gave up„ÄÇHe starts chatting with us tooÔºå everything's going fine„ÄÇ

We find out that she's there celebrating her friend's birthday„ÄÇ

 and she's only there with that one other girl„ÄÇI introduced her friend to my friend„ÄÇ

 we all had a drink togetherÔºå and about 15 minutes later we were all out of the club going back to my hotel„ÄÇ

It's probably the prettiest curl I ever saw in DCÔºå certainly the prettiest I ever hooked up with there„ÄÇ

It it didn't happen accidentallyÔºå it happened because I was decisive„ÄÇ

 it happened because I was willing to move bigger men out of my way go get what I want„ÄÇ

And because I really to tolerate the social pressure„ÄÇ

 one of those guys squeezequeing the hell out of my shoulderÔºå and beingre painful really„ÄÇ

Holding my frameÔºå holding my facial a laugh back„ÄÇChatting up the girl like there was no big deal„ÄÇ

If you're not willing to tolerate social pressureÔºå you're going to miss opportunities like this„ÄÇ

re not willing to do things other guys would be scared to do„ÄÇ

 you're going to miss a lot of opportunities to get a girl very excitedÔºå pray delighted to meet you„ÄÇ

More books on this topic„ÄÇInfluenced by Robert Chaldini„ÄÇHannibal and me by Andreass Guth„ÄÇ

Exercises help implement this topic„ÄÇWhen you feel anxious or stuck in your head„ÄÇ

Go to the girl anyway and tell her soÔºå get to a place of sincerity and authenticity in your communication„ÄÇ

And plenty of times I' stucking my head on the club„ÄÇI think about a lot of early shit„ÄÇ

 I watch a lot of documentaries I listen to or read a lot of books„ÄÇ

I don't waste my time on uselessless shit that being in the case when I go to the club place to have unadulterated fun and just clown around and do what you want sometimes I'm not in that mood when I first get there sometimes I see the pretty girl and my first thought isn't to talk to her at that moment it's to make a goddamn excuse myself„ÄÇ

I feel that happening and I never succumb to that excuseÔºå get my ass over there and talk to the girl„ÄÇ

If I don't have something better to sayÔºå I' simply tell the girl how I'm feeling at that moment„ÄÇ

Oh my GodÔºå I watched the bus documentary this afternoon and I'm a little bit stuck in my head„ÄÇ

You're really pretty girlÔºå so I had to come meet youÔºå I'm DerekÔºå what's your nameÔºü

Whatever emotion you're feeling and the thing that you might be more scared to say than you think she would judge you for„ÄÇ

 get that shit out there anywayÔºå when she sees you're not bullsshing her she sees you speaking from a place of sincerity and authenticity„ÄÇ

 not for any moralistic reasonÔºå god damnam it„ÄÇJust because it pragmatically works„ÄÇ

I value women and high value men get lighted to a whole day„ÄÇ

 they both really value someone who's not bulling them„ÄÇThey can see it a mile away„ÄÇ

If you do what I told you to do here„ÄÇIt'sSecond going to get the girl excited to go home and have sex with you this minute„ÄÇ

NoÔºå probably notÔºå but it will do this consistently to buy you an extra 30 seconds or 90 seconds„ÄÇ

Conveying more of your personality to get her investing back„ÄÇYou could do it that„ÄÇ

 a lot of those interactions that you didn't feel like opening„ÄÇ

 you're going to end up going home with those girls not long after„ÄÇ
